cameras,"Handles Great, Autofocus just not there","C. Moore ""The Authorguy""",R2V2ILU2VF2BUH,3,"First, a couple of things.I wanted this camera to be great. I researched all the consumer dSLRs and decided on the XT Rebel 350 because of it's size and 8MP CCD, plus, I'd had two Canon point and shoot digitals that were fantastic.I've been taking pictures on a semi-professtional level for thirty years and I attended Brooks Institute of Photography, so I sort of know what I'm doing.Bought the Rebel XT at a local store in San Francisco, along with the Canon 28-200 Zoom. Immediately went up to Chinatown to shoot pictures of the Festival of the Harvest Moon with my wife, who was using her Nikon D70 with the Nikon 28-200.Shot pictures all day, and absolutely loved the way the XT handled. It was very intuitive, fast, had a bright viewfinder -- I couldn't have been happier.Then, we got home and looked at the pictures. I'd shot mostly on automatic, or shutter priority all day, with shutter speeds above 250th of a second.Bottom line, my wife's pictures were crystal clear, popped really, and mine of the same or similar subjects were just a tad fuzzy. You couldn't tell at 5x7 or so, but when you brought it up to 8x10 or above the difference was obvious. I checked the historgram on the shots, and they were made at nearly the same settings. Couldn't be, right? After all, the Nikon is only 6 MP, the Canon 8MP.So I put both cameras on a tripod, pointed them at a brick wall with a sign about 100 feet away, set everything the same on the cameras, and low and behold, same fuzziness.I took the Canon back the next day and traded it in on a D70. Now, maybe I got a bad lense, or a camera where the auto-focus was tweaked, but I couldn't afford the time to test it out again and again. I knew the Nikon would work, and it did (and does).Since then, I've talked to friends, professionals, who say that the XT is known to have auto-focus ""issues"". This seems to be inconsistent, with some reviewers being delighted by the camera, others having a little problem.As I said above, the camera handles really well, intuitively, and I actually like the compact size (some SLR users like a heavier camera). I may have gotten a lemon, but if you are going to need to depend on getting sharp pictures and can't go back for reshoots, I'd step up to the Canon D20 or go with a Nikon dSLR.","January 18, 2006",0
cameras,"Too small, and too little","LightnnRod ""LightnnRod""",R3ICN5W59DWFKD,3,"We were using a Digital Rebel 6.3MP and an old Sony 5.0 MP 7X optical when the Sony got wet and began working intermittently. Time to replace the Sony and move up a notch! Having been well-impressed with the Rebel 6.3 and the two lenses we'd added (EF 55-200 4.5-5.6 USM and the superb EF 700-200 2.8 with Canon's 2X extender bought used), we decided to jump on the Digital Rebel XT with the 18-55 lens.It arrived Thursday, and we sent it back Monday. Here's why. It was too small. Smaller is usually better, but the XT started to feel and look like a toy camera, or at least a point-and-shoot. My wife and I both have smallish hands, and the XT was bordering on being too small to be ergonomic for us. With the 70-200 lens attached, the Rebel XT disappeared.The second why is features. This is not a knock on the XT, which is a fine (excellent, really) camera with significant improvements over the original Digital Rebel. When we sent the XT back, we got Canon's 20D. Aha! you say. The XT and the 20D are basically the same camera. Not completely, and here's Canon's language comparing the two:""There are, of course, some very real differences between the EOS Digital Rebel XT digital camera and the more advanced EOS 20D. While the 20D SLR includes performance features such as faster continuous shooting speed (5 frames per second [fps] vs. 3 fps) with larger burst capability (23 frames vs. 14 frames) and custom function settings (18 vs. 9) that more than justify its heftier price tag, this new Rebel XT model was created for those dedicated SLR users who are migrating to digital for the first time and don't wish to give up the flexibility an SLR system offers.""After using the Digital Rebel and three lenses (plus extender) we evolved from point-and-shoot to serious amateurs, and now we're knocking on the door of ""prosumer."" The 20D puts us there. It also uses the same batteries as the Digital Rebel, which is a plus. Like the Digital Rebel, the 20D is the size of a traditional SLR and easier to handle than the XT, even if it weighs a bit more.This is not a rip on the XT, but a word to the wise for folks like us who feel ready to move to the next level. We took some fine photos with the XT, which we aren't discarding just because we sent back the XT.A final note: If you get the XT (and that is not a bad thing), get the body only and a lens other than the 18-55 that comes standard in the Digital Rebel and XT kits. Again, this is a fine lens with good, middle-of-the-road capability. But if you're getting serious, you need all the lens you can afford, or even a little more than you can afford. The Canon EF-S 17-85 4.5-5.6 gives a lot of range and versatility and would be great with an XT if you're trying for really good photos while keeping life simple and your camera-lens package light. Even better is the EF-S 10-22 3.5-4.5. But the prize of our collection is the EF 24-70 2.8. It provides superb performance. Yes, the cheapest of those is about the price of an XT body. You get what you pay for. We were lucky enough to have fallen into a little cash and put it into a 20D and a great lens (24-70), a really good lens (10-22), and a relatively compact versatile lens that performs well in good light (17-85).If you're sitting on the fence as to your photographic future, I hope this helps.","July 9, 2005",0
cameras,"Call me vain, but...",TUFFER,R3JYXN5YJTPPDG,3,"I initially bought this camera because of it's ""ease of use"", and the compact travel size afforded for an SLR. But after a trip to NYC I completely changed my mind and upgraded to the 20D. First was the size: This camera is an ergonomic catastrophy. I did love its light weight feel while slung around my neck, but if you put any other lense on this camera, you will soon find that it will completely off-balance the camera itself and make for an abnormal feel. The case is just too small for me for an SLR. I also couldn't stand the cheap feel of the casing. Hold it next to a 20D and you'll see what I mean. For anyone getting into digital SLR photography I would recommend paying the extra $500 for the model above the XT...20D. Its just as easy to use as the XT, but with MUCH MORE POTENTIAL! Why buy a camera with limited capabilities, even if you are a beginner? By the way, we all know its the LENSE that takes the picture, the camera just processes the information. You will never be sorry buying good L line lenses over the cheap stuff with so-so reviews. I used the 17-40mm L with the XT and it took unbelievable pictures, no question. I'm for sure keeping the lense.In summary; the camera has good but limited features, and with the L lense took amazing pictures, but the petite size and cheap feel didn't work for me.","August 30, 2005",0
cameras,"Ok starter camera, not OK repair costs",Z. Curtiss,R2JBOPZ2IZST8E,3,"Up to this point in my ownership of the camera---two years---I have been quite happy with this camera as a camera to get into photography with. I have pulled quite a few shots I have been extremely impressed with. However, I was recently performing some lens sharpness testing, and in the middle of it, my mirror lock-up feature stopped working: it would not record an image at all while that custom function was enabled. I called Canon's technical support number, and the guy on their end was very friendly and we tried resetting the camera to its default settings and custom functions. When this failed to work, he gave me the address to return it for repairs, not really mentioning that because I was out of warranty that this wouldn't be a cheap expenditure. I'm sure he couldn't really speculate as to how much since he didn't know the problem, but a heads up of the possibility would have been nice. Instead, I got an email notification of the repairs estimate, and it was $210!!!!! Not too much shy of what a person might buy a used or rebuilt camera for on here. For $50, a person can get an extended warranty from Canon for an additional 4 years. I think that would be well worth it, since you know you will pay significantly more than that in repair costs if and when your camera goes south. Something to think seriously about, because it is an electronic item, and the standard warranty of a year doesn't get you very far. I would have to say that I think Canon's repair charges are a bit steep though given the total worth of such a camera. I can't say that I'll take my shopping to another brand's camera lineup though, because I do like Canon's products, but I was just disappointed this time that they couldn't get that function back up and running for considerably less.","April 5, 2009",0
cameras,Sad story about Canon Digital Rebel XT fill-in flash failure,Marie-Christine de Montreal,R1649V29MA0J30,3,"I bought a Digital Rebel XT last april 2005 after taking a lot of information on this camera on internet websites and with retail stores. I chose up this Canon product for two major reasons, first Nikon D70 was not available at that time and second Digital Rebel XT + lense EF-S17-85mm IS USM seemed to be better and affordable choice. But 2 months and 24 days of use later, I feel very disappointed. When I tried to take pictures of my daughter receiving honors at her ""gala meritas"", the fill-in flash with loud clickety-clack noises refused stubbornly to pop up. It was impossible to take any pictures with flash even after the camera was shut off and reopened again. Each time an error message was appearing up in the viewfinder, blocking completely the use of the camera. And this is not the end of this sad story because Montreal Canon customer service is very slow to handle up my request of service, at least 4 weeks. And don't try to ask questions to a Canon technician. Only the retailer is able to get a few information and answer you to wait because you don't buy at least a $5000 camera to have the right to get faster service. Really, really frustrating buying experience...","June 30, 2005",0
cameras,Follow up to Quality Control Issues,"Paul Mcclain ""PM""",RCWO96ZXNHO97,3,"This is a follow up to the previous review:Amazon was very prompt in replacing the camera. The new camera has performed beautifully with no hint of any problems. All things considered I would now rate this a 5 star, though I can't help but be nervous.The brand new Rebel XT I received had a faulty flash button and flash function right out of the box. When lighting levels are low the camera pops up the flash automatically, however with this one several malfunctions occured simultaneously:*the flash popped up, but did not fire*the camera made a weird rapidfire clicking sound like keys being quickly pressed on an old-fashioned typewriter*the camera would ""seize"" or lock-up, the only recourse being to cycle the power off and on manually*the only item then displayed on the LCD was a low battery warning (even though the battery was fully charged. This indicator would revert to charged status after cycling the power.)*lastly, of course, no image would be stored.I will say Amazon was exceptionally prompt in issuing a replacement order.I've owned a Canon A-1 for 23 years and it's seen a lot of use. I get the feeling this one probably won't be around that long.","August 2, 2007",0

cameras,Major drawback in LCD screen,A. Villanueva,R33Z8C0DVJ0VJ2,3,"I was so excited to get this as my first SLR camera, it was very affordable and had so many features... however, I didn't realize that you could not use the LCD screen as a viewfinder. You have to look through the tiny viewfinder to see your picture before you take it. Then you can view the pictures taken via the LCD screen. Major drawback for me. I will be returning it and buying a different camera that allows for LCD viewfinder usage.","September 20, 2007",0
cameras,"Great Specs, but too small",Stephen Becker,RWQTAUP23BP8Z,3,"This is a really nice Digital SLR, but if you are upgrading from the original Digital Rebel be warned that this is a MUCH smaller body. It does not have the same high quality feel as the first and it is actually pretty hard to use if you have large hands. To me it is almost worth paying the $450 more for the 20d just to get the larger body.","November 17, 2005",0
cameras,Disappointed,"Mauro S. A. Anna ""MSAS""",RM2IMQ9B07WXL,3,"I am a long time found of Canon cameras since my F1 SLR twenty years ago.This is the fourth digital camera by Canon that I buy. My first one was an A20, then an A70 and Rebel XT SLR. I bought the S2IS for informal situations where I didn't want to carry the SLR and its accessories but still wanted to take decent pictures. The movie mode was great too, so I didn't need to carry my camcorder.Of course it's no Rebel XT, but this camera compares poorly in terms of image quality even with the A20 and A70. Actually, the A20 took the best pictures of all the Powershots I owned.On paper it's a very good camera, but I cannot say I am satisfied, even after some six months using it. Here are the problems:* The image has a lot of noise, especially in light colored shaded areas, EVEN IN DAYLIGHT! Reviewing my old pictures taken with the A20 and the A70, I can assure that none of them showed the problem.* I see a lot of chromatic aberration at maximum zoom, even halfway from the center to the border of the picture. One can say ""what would you expect for the price""? But what good is a 12X zoom if you take crappy pictures then? BTW, neither the A20 nor the A70 showed the same level of chromatic aberration at their's (3X) maximum zoom.* It complains that the batteries are low much too early. Not only did the batteries lasted way more on the A20 ad A70 using both Ni-MH and alkalines, the recharging takes 20 minutes instead of the regular one hour, showing that the batteries still have juice. Same for the alkalines: ""expended"" batteries from this camera last a lot in other equipment.* The movie format is not very compressed due to the codec used, so the movie mode takes a lot of room in the card, much more that it should had they used something like MPEG2.* The lens cap is really horrible (see other reviews).The camera works, the stabilization is nice, the movie mode works well for small clips, though focus can be slow sometimes. If you are not very particular about image quality you might live with the other shortcomings.A further tip: I use both high-speed and ""regular"" memory cards. Even with the slow cards, you can get clips up to 45 seconds because the camera has an internal buffer. It even shows how full the buffer is so you are not interrupted abruptly.","April 24, 2006",0
cameras,i was hoping for a better camera,Ben Collins,R1UQRW5KITSNZ1,3,"I have to say that I am NOT very pleased with this camera. I also own a canon SD200 and I was hoping that the S2IS would take better photos, but that hasn't been the case. The quality of the photos is about the same. Can't tell much difference between the two, but the S2IS has a much harder time focusing in. while using the zoom indoors the S2IS will not focus at all. Sometimes even outdoors I have a hard time with the focus. I expected a little better than this. My SD200 rarely has a hard time focusing. The things that I do like are the great zoom and great movie quality. If your planning on buying a video camera I would buy this instead. Takes great video and has the stabilization built in. if this camera would focus in better, I would love it. I find myself using the sd200 just because its more dependable in getting the picture in focus. I really wanted to love this camera, but there is just to many things you have to worry about to take great photos. I can also get just as good photos with my older sd200.","May 8, 2006",0
cameras,"Good Camera, But With Some Flaws",R. L. Pullen,R1C15B9CJRA1X2,3,"I've had the camera for about a month, and taken several pictures. Overall, I am pleased with the quality of the photos. I haven't had the same problem with AF that some reviewers mentioned, and none in zoom mode. I bought a lens adapter from lensmateonline along with a polarizing filter, along with a real lens cap and am very pleased. The addition is worth considering.My biggest complaint, and while the camera only got 3 stars from me, is framing shots. If it is a cloudy day, both the view-finder and the LCD screen darken the image so much that you have no idea what you're shooting. And, it's even worse on a bright sunny day. I hate ""trusting to luck"", but that's what you have to do.If I had it to do over again, I'd opt for a digital SLR. This camera will probably become the ""family"" camera.","May 19, 2006",0
cameras,A built in zoom for the advanced beginner,ZooMama,RXL1LI7ZCS344,3,"Do not depend on Amazon's description to include a note of the other items you may need.Now then...Krupnik has written a thorough review of the S2 ;) thanks Jim! I learned a lot from your review.**deleted review content - outdated tech, read below**update Mar, 7, 2010This thing drains batteries even when not in use & I was finding that I had to have recharged or new batteries ready every couple of days. I was also having problems with it not taking good photos in a lower light setting. The shots are VERY noisy - think a grainy film photo - especially when the batteries begin to run down, even with the amazing Sanyo Eneloops. While I have improved my skills using this camera and have been able to get some very good shots with it, I outgrew it quickly and the limitations I began to discover within the first couple of months convinced me I needed a major upgrade. I now am the proud owner of a Nikon D90 - and what a camera it is!! I would strongly recommend buying a newer version of the Powershot S series if the buyer wants to stay with the 'all in one' set up you get with them. (Nikon's Coolpix version is also very good) I had considered one thinking I would never be able to afford the Nikon, but we had a good tax return this year :) I realized I wanted to do more with photography than one of these cameras would allow. Basically, it's a good enough camera with a few shortcomings, but it's from 2005 & considering how fast technology is outdated these days, you'd be better off going with a newer model. I have changed my 5 star rating to a 3 considering there are newer & better models available. With tech, buying 'old' to save money isn't a good thing.","February 24, 2009",0
cameras,Macro falls short,"Dallas ""SF Mama""",RUMUKWFZKIQOF,3,"I currently have a Canon G3 that I love, but I've had it for a couple years now, and I'm interested in an upgrade. I use my camera mostly for macro nature photography and everyday around the house photos. Most of the time I use automatic settings and come out with decent results. I've been wanting a better telephoto lens for birding. This is what I was comparing the Canon S2 IS against when I took it out for a test drive this weekend. I will be returning the S2 - it wasn't worth it as an upgrade to me.There are a few design features that I did not like. The S2 uses the LCD to show what features are enabled. I prefer how the G3 has two seperate screens - one as a view finder and one for displaying settings. That way, if the LCD is closed, I can still see what settings I have selected. The eyepiece viewfinder is digital, not optical. When I'm zoomed in all the way, I will use it to track an animal, where I can see more of the scene, but the S2 eyepiece displays the same picture as the LCD, and when zoomed in all the way it was too blurry to see anything.I loved the image stabilization and the telephoto lens. I was able to stand in my house and get decent photos of squirrels and birds in trees outside. I could get clear basketball players at dusk from a distance. The colors did not seem as rich as my other camera, but the image quality for normal shots seemed just as good. The camera focuses quickly and the pictures are quick.The macro lens is what I was very disappointed about. It's true that you can get a photo with the lens directly on the object - I got a shot of the newspaper with the lens touching, but no animal or insect is going to let me get that close for a photo anyway. The part I disliked the most with the macro is that you cannot zoom in that mode. Usually I get as close as I can physically and then zoom in, but not with the S2.Personally, I still want a camera that can do a telephoto zoom as well as this one, but not lose the macro capabilities I have with my G3. Unfortunately, I don't think there are any available right now that meet my needs, without me going to SLR.","November 10, 2005",0
cameras,"Worked great for over 6 years, then BSOD.",Christopher M Carney,R1NVEGZES299L8,3,"Like so many others who purchased this camera I experienced the black screen-of-death (BSOD) on the LCD and viewfinder, rendering the unit inoperable.As I understand it the problem is caused by a stuck shutter. After a little bit of research I found a site that posted a remedy which actually worked for a time. I'll post it here in the hopes that it may help someone out. What you have to do is set the camera to Tv mode using the dial on top. Tv stands for shutter priority mode. You then go in through the on-screen settings to increase the shutter speed to the maximum amount possible - in my case 15 seconds. You then take a picture, holding your finger on the button (it will take a while), and after about 7-8 seconds you open the battery compartment while the shot is still in progress. This is key. The idea behind opening the battery compartment is it interrupts power to the camera, causing a quick power jolt to the shutter motor in the hopes of making it unstuck. I was incredulous about this at first, but it actually worked, for a time.That was a few months ago. I was able to get a couple more pictures out of it but now I can go through the above procedure 10 times in a row and still no love. I have read that some users had to do it as many as a dozen times in a row before they got the shutter unstuck, but my feeling is that if you're doing that just to get off one picture you're probably better off looking for a new camera.I give this camera 3 stars because for about 6 years it took wonderful pictures, mostly of my kids growing up. It was very easy to use, extremely versatile, and it was a cinch to upload pictures to the computer and edit with the included software. Unfortunately, this stuck-shutter issue really hurt the Canon Powershot S2 IS credibility (and no doubt of Canon itself judging by the number of negative reviews here and elsewhere), and though I may have been luckier than most with this product's longevity, it is very difficult to excuse them for not dealing with a known defect on a $400 camera.","November 5, 2013",0

cameras,Go for the DSLR,tim_sf,R9O0Y2PID4QH6,3,"I bought this camera based on some of the reviews and because I didn't want to shell out $1000 for an DSLR. I got it home and started playing with it.Sure, it's a decent camera, but it was obvious that I would eventually want to upgrade to an DSLR.All things considered, there are a couple of ways to think about this camera:One is that it is a relative bargain for what it offers. High resolution, relatively fast shooting speed (compared to other point and shoot cameras), high quality video capability (amazingly good), image stabilized lens (low light shots were still blurry), 12X zoom, macro capability in an all-in-one package. You don't really need any addons except for more memory and a case.The other side is that it is expensive. $450-500 is expensive for anything, and this camera is no exception.For me, I believed the latter. Since I was spending $500, why not spend a few hundred more (ok 500 more) and just get the Digital Rebel XT?Anyway, after battling the 2 sides for a day or so, I returned the camera and bought the digital rebel XT. My advice is to definitely go for the DSLR, they are in different leagues.The S2 performed poorly in low light. It has an overly complex menu system. The DSLR has more buttons. I like buttons. They are much more accessible than a nested menu system.The S2 was slow, offering 1.5 fps (max) while my DSLR has 3 fps. I found the wait to take my next shot with the S2 agonizingly slow, with the flash much longer.Strangely, the S2 has a lens cap that just won't stay on. Perhaps one of the weakest aspects of the camera. I was holding the camera still, and the cap just slid off to the floor. Be prepared to lose the cap eventually.The S2 has a cheap plastic silver look to it. It looks like the ""flavor of the month"". I'm not sure why so many electronics are plastic silver. Guess it's the trend. I'd much rather have black. I believe the S2 is as heavy as or even heavier than the Digital Rebel XT.Bottom line is the camera may be one of the best sub-DSLR camera out there but it doesn't come close to the DSLR . Not by a long shot.","September 17, 2005",0
cameras,"Great camera, lousy documentation",Henry Stien,RW2K0LCPM5YRO,3,"We had the family Easter Hunt yesterday and my father-in-law brought his new canon camera. We spent 1/2 hour going through the manual to figure out the basics and found a lot of errors in manual. Much of what we tried didn't work, including how to erase all images. It had somehow protected an image and we couldn't delete it. The reference pages were often wrong too. Luckily one friend had a similar canon camera and could give lessons. It does have a lot of great features but the documentation should have been better. It may have been returned if someone hadn't been able to teach the features. We also blew off the advanced features such as the special effects and used a media editor program, roxio emc8 instead. When you ignore the over 70 year old market and don't take the documentaiton seriously that is a big strike against the product. Tech stuff is hard enough for many people so at least canon should have put more effort into their instructions.","April 16, 2006",0

cameras,Better Choices Are Now Available,Fred Anonymous Smith,R3JV9FD71UEUGP,3,"Since no camera is perfect for everyone, I truly hesitated (for over a month) to write this review. But, since I wrote a glowing review of another Canon camera model (the A620), fairness almost demanded a less positive review where equally warranted.Like a previous reviewer, I also returned the Canon S3 IS recently purchased. And, just like that other reviewer, a significant reason was the small LCD display. I found it nearly impossible to use without reading glasses - not an obvious issue until actually using it in the ""real world."" Of course, the Canon A620 has the same small display, but one is more willing to overlook an annoyance such as this in a product costing considerably less. But, with a camera costing as much as the Canon S3 IS, there is little excuse today for such a small display (indeed, several other cameras in this price range offer a larger display).Regardless, if this were the only issue with the Canon S3 IS, it might have been possible to live with this annoyance as well. But, added to that, the overall quality of this camera bothered me. Some aspects of the camera, such as the plastic tripod mount, suggests cheap construction. I seriously doubt a plastic mount can survive the repeated punishment of the often sharp metal screws found on the typical camera tripod. Plastic into plastic, perhaps. Metal into metal, of course. But not metal into plastic. Canon should know this, but went ahead with the plastic anyway. Since I use a tripod often (anyone seeking good images should), this annoyance was a little more difficult to ignore. But, moreover, this got me thinking about the rest of the camera. If Canon was so willing to cut corners with a plastic tripod mount, one has to wonder how far they went to cut corners in places consumers cannot easily see - the electronics and mechanics inside the camera.There were other minor disappointments (weak flash, noisy EVF, and so on), but I could reasonably live with those. None, including the above, were enough to cause me to utterly rule out the Canon S3 IS. The early reviews of the newer Sony DSC-H5 were the final straw. A look at the features, and a trip to the store to actually handle the camera, was enough to finally cause me to switch.The Sony offers an additional 1.2 million pixels of image resolution (even if one doesn't make larger prints, the extra resolution gives more room for cropping images), a larger LCD display, a better EVF, a metal tripod mount, a stronger flash, and more. It also performs better at ISO-400, offering another full stop of usable exposure over the Canon S3 IS (important to me during the long dark winters of northern Europe, but a benefit to anyone shooting in low-light conditions). The Sony doesn't perform exceptionally well at the larger ISO settings (ISO-800 and 1000), but neither does the Canon (no ISO-1000 setting, but similar performance at ISO-800). Otherwise, both the Sony and Canon are pretty evenly matched - little else gained or lost by chosing one over the other. I did lose the articulating display offered on the Canon S3 IS, but, more importantly, gained significantly in the other areas mentioned in this paragraph.Like the other reviewer, perhaps a future Canon S(?) IS camera addressing these issues might tempt me to return to the Canon fold. But, in the meantime, Canon has lost this customer to Sony.","July 4, 2006",0
cameras,A Not So Great Point-and-Shoot Camera,P. Olivier,R111EWIKCZ6P09,3,"I'm a very experienced photographer, been published and won a few contests too. I use Canon SLR cameras, lenses and equipment which is GREAT stuff. So, when I wanted to add a professional level point-and-shoot camera the Canon Powershot S3 IS was an easy choice. It has excellent optics and essentially the same technology used in Canon's SLRs. So what could go wrong?First and foremost, everyone should know the Electronic Viewfinder on S3 is VERY pixelated and dark - like looking thru heavy mesh screen. It's difficult to know when you have a sharp focus. Also, the LCD screen is VERY small and dark. It's difficult to see images on this screen in bright light. It simply does not work well for me doing fine art photography. If you plan to use this camera 100 percent of the time in autofocus, these concerns do not apply to you. However, if you plan to do any Macro photography this will be a problem. Personally, I like to know with absolute certainty my photos are sharp and subjects are in focus. No one likes to see fuzzigraphs!I have also found it far too easy to accidently push one of the many buttons scattered over the camera surface. For example, I had set the camera to best quality, highest resolution to shoot flower pictures. Somewhere along the way I hit the wrong button and took a few low resolution images before discovering the change of setting. My SLR's have lots of buttons too, but I've never had this happen before.The macro (close-up)capability of this camera is greatly over-rated. It only works on wide angle settings of the lens. Therefore, you must be VERY close to the subject photographed. I bought a Canon 500D close up lens to take macros and still have the full 12X zoom of the camera's lens.A few reviewers have commented on the very poor quality of the manual that accompanies the S3. I must agree. It IS hard to figure out and I've got a lot of experience reading Canon manuals, figuring out Canon menus and setting camera dials. It's been my experience most folks don't read the manuals. They learn just enough to take pictures and never explore the full power of these devices. The big ""P"" on the Program dial does NOT stand for ""perfect"". So, if you don't read manuals, ignore my comments.The picture quality is very good and should not disappoint anyone - assuming of course it's properly focused. The one thing you need to know is that as good as the meter is in this camera, you will have to learn about Exposure Compensation if you expect properly exposed images. Over- and under- exposures can be avoided with compensation and using the camera's histogram features.I gave this camera a 3 star rating because it does not live up to the quality and performance I've come to expect from Canon. It's a decent camera, but for it's price it should be MUCH BETTER.","October 16, 2006",0
cameras,The good and the bad...,K. Gittins,RYPL3DVU0USRT,3,"After giving up a 30-year hobby for a while, I sold all my film stuff and got a Canon A95 to check out digital photography. When the A95 was stolen, I got an A620. This got me back into photography enough that I bought a Pentax DSLR and a bunch of lenses. As that bag started to get quite heavy and bulky, I started pooping around with the A620 again for those times I wanted to travel light or casual (such at a nephew's wedding where I was not, thankfully, ""the"" photographer.) However, the A620, nice as it was, is a bit limiting on the focal length - not particularly wide, and not really telephoto, either. So, I decided to sell the A620 and get the S3, mainly for the longer focal length for daylight people shots.I opted not to get the S5 as I would not be using an external flash, the extra megapixels are not needed, and the other minor differences did not justify the additional $200 in cost.So, am I better off than before? Maybe. I have a nice stabilized zoom, and a better movie mode that I'm sure I will put to use on occasion. I have a faster continuous shooting mode as well. And the live histogram is a great feature, too.If that was the end of it I would give it 4 or 5 stars. However, with all the good stuff, there are a couple things that are a real problem.First is the ISO button on the back. This is very easy to push by accident (perhaps even with my nose?) and if you don't frequently check the tiny ISO setting in the viewfinder (if you are shooting that way), you run the risk of some unusable, grainy high-ISO shots :-(Second, a good/bad thing is the ""S"" button on the back. This is a ""shortcut"" button that can be set to one of a few functions, such as focus lock, white balance, movie frame rate, etc. However, it comes set to adjust the image size. So, much like the ISO button, until you switch the setting you'll risk shooting a bunch of small images before you realize the error. I have subsequently changed the button to simply turn off the display.The third issue is the poor high-ISO performance. At 80 or 100 the image is smooth and nice. At 200 there is a touch of grain but definitely acceptable. At 400 you are going to have noticeable grain, and you should only use 800 for documentation - such as showing the neighbor's car in your parking space, or similar non-artistic images (unless you are using grain as the effect).So, essentially a great camera has some serious button problems. Too bad the ISO is not just another programmable shortcut button. I'm thinking of making a little cover over it - how silly is that? (Edit - I've stuck some 1/4 inch rubber circles right next to the button. They've nearly eliminated accidental button pushes, though I still check the setting frequently.)Oh, the EVF is pretty grainy compared to an optical viewfinder. And the LCD, like most, is a pain in sunlight, even in the ""bright"" setting.If you don't need the fancy stereo-sound movies or a rotating LCD, there may be better alternatives.","July 17, 2007",0
cameras,Not quite an SLR alternative,ipte,R19QITH8O4NT35,3,"I was looking for a high-end compact camera to take on short trips as an alternative to my SLR. I was prepared to make some sacrifices compared to an SLR, but even so this camera didn't quite make the cut and I returned it. Here's why.PROS: It's small and light (compared to an SLR). The EVF is very usable. The ability to swivel the display is great, especially for macro shooting. Super macro mode gets you very close. The long zoom is fun, and the image stabilization makes it usable. For this type of camera, noise is well controlled at ISO 100 and 200, and the noise reduction is light (no smearing). Live histogram and gridlines are both available. Focusing speed, shutter lag, and save times are all pretty good. The lens is quite fast considering its focal range; it's easy to create background blur at most focal lengths. Good hand grip. Overall, a great feature set in very flexible and usable design.CONS: As with all compact cameras, dynamic range is limited, highlights often get clipped, and anything over ISO 400 is basically worthless. I was prepared to put up with that. But what immediately bothered me was the amount of chromatic aberration (both purple and red fringing, especially next to black areas) and corner softness, plus mild vignetting. Basically, the optics don't live up to the quality of the rest of the camera. I couldn't find a way to control the CA using different apertures, and it was just more than I could put up with.As always, look at a detailed review with sample shots (like DPReview) and make up your own mind.","April 6, 2007",0
cameras,"Very good camera, except for the video mode flaw...","Graeck ""grack""",R24Z3F0WXY3G2J,3,"I got this camera today and have given it all the tests I could think of. Played with all the different modes. Took it outside for some nature shots, etc. Overall it's a great camera, and the new lower prices makes it even a better deal. However, when shooting videos there is a very noticeable high pitched whine. I've tried adjusting all audio and video settings, turning off the IS, etc. There's nothing I can do to get rid of this annoying sound that occurs during all video recording. A quick web search turned up that this is a common problem with this camera and seems to affect most, if not all, S3s to some degree or another. Mine happens to be particularly bad. The user forums over at dpreview dot com talk about this problem. I've written Canon and am awaiting a reply. If they cannot fix this, my S3 is going back to the store. One of my reasons for choosing this camera was the great video features - however, this audio problem is rendering all videos shot on this camera unwatchable. Had this not been a problem, this camera would have gotten 4-4.5 stars. However, since this problem is so annoying and seems to be very common on S3s, I'm having to rate this just 2 stars.","March 13, 2007",0
cameras,Same as kodak z612,"Philip Keith Miller ""phil""",R28BQW64M7T8R7,3,"I owned and returned the much cheaper and sopposedly poorly quality Kodak z612. But I now own an s3 IS and can't tell the difference between this and the Kodak. In fact the Canon seems to be worse in low light and even grainier at iso above 100. The outdoor, high natural light pictures tent to have slightly more true colors than the Kodak, but that is all. Most of my pictures turn out blurred or grainy, and I have played around with the manual settings, but still can't get very good quality pictures. I did a lot of research before buying this Camera, and was leaning towards getting an sony H2, but went with the Canon because of reputation and because I got a really good deal on it.

cameras,A simple and Quick Review,D. Rhew,R3AE1ME24GRXSZ,3,"I am NOT not a newcomer to digital cameras or 35mm either.I have gotten some really nice shots with this camera. Those were achieved when I had a little time to fine-tune all my settings. If you just use auto mode, you will NOT be pleased (if you know a good pic when you see it).I have 3 kids so the fact that I have to fiddle with it before I can snap a picture is a BIG no-no in my book. I have to be quick around here! That was one star gone.The other star gone is the noise issue. It does NOT matter what settings I use, there is always some sort of noise. Granted, if you run it through an editing program, it's okay..... BUT I don't want to HAVE to edit ALL of my pics.I haven't replaced it yet... so I guess I'm dealing with it.

cameras,Excited and happy at first.... now very disappointed :0(,M. Cummins,RF0O8GRP6KYDK,3,"I did weeks of research looking for a camera with a good zoom, a wide choice of aperture settings and good picture quality! I purchased this camera in April of 2007. It seemed to be working fine and I've taken hundreds of pictures with it. Now a year and 2 months later (2 months after the warranty expired) I went to go on a hike and tried to turn my camera on only to find that it was dead. We tried putting new batteries in with no avail. After returning home from my hike I started doing some research on the internet. I have found quite a few different posts that detail the very same problem as mine. One post mentions that a circuit board in the camera went out and it was almost $200 to fix it. I am a very disappointed customer at this point. I figured a camera that cost $ 350 would last longer than a little over a year. Canon has not issued a recall and hence will not repair it for free. I'm thinking I might need to look elsewhere for my next camera.","June 30, 2008",0

The Panasonics image quality is much better. The S3's pictures are grainy and never got that level of crispness I got with the Panasonic. It is also very light and does not have the quality feel of the panasonic.I tried to save $150 and it didn't work. I am going to go ahead and buy the FZ-50.","June 11, 2007",0
cameras,Some big exceptions,K. Grace,R1L55UV0XVF0PN,3,"This is a sturdy, solid formidable camera; it takes great shots and has most of the features I was looking for in a take everywhere camera - good zoom, good lens, adjustable screen, AA batteries, movie mode, good macro features, image stabilizer. But with that package came nuisances I ended up not being able to tolerate. There are buttons everywhere that you would naturally put your hand to hold a camera if you are even a slightly experienced photographer. I kept resetting features everytime I picked up the camera, and ended up finally handling it like a raw egg. You can't ""grab it"" you must pick it up with two fingers to avoid hitting buttons you don't want to hit. I carry a camera with me always in a pocket in my bag. Because of the button issue, I've had to put it in a case, so I don't turn it on from simply jostling the bag. The camera once turned on when I laid my jacket down and it was comic watching my bag go in and out with the lens pushing it. But that kind of ""accident"" can screw up the lens. It does not have a natural hand-hold and it's hard to find a comfortable way to grip the camera - and I have small hands - it would be much worse if you have large hands. The LCD screens - well, there's isn't much great to say here - they are simply inadequate in daylight. Canon recommends using the viewfinder when in broad daylight because the LCD screen is barely visible, but the viewfinder reads very poorly - you cannot accurately see what your are framing - detail, color, anything close to accurate representation is just not there. The adjustable lcd screen mechanics are simply magnificent-a feature I was thrilled to have-but viewing it is simply inadequate. - I just decided tonight that this camera just wasn't good enough for my needs and am ordering the Sony DSC H5. Canon, I hope you are listening - if it weren't for the viewing screens and the crazy button layout, this would be my camera.","September 24, 2006",0

The flash is a bit overpowering, so I try not to use it (i try to avoid flash anyway), but if you are trying to take a picture from 6 feet away forget it, because the picture will be washed out. I had a dinky little kodak easyshare that focused better than this one, but I wouldn't recommend one of those either. If you are willing to pay this money for a camera, it may be more worth it just to spring for the SLR. I wish I had.","February 8, 2009",0

Well, I don't know about that. It seem to me that all of my friends have better puctures then mine after we shoot the same stuff. To me a lot of the shots done in Auto are not vivid, the colors just don't grab your attention. Too dark to me. Especially when you shoot with the flash, which itself is useless. The pictures have more grain that I was hoping for. The outside pictures are better, but still nothing to scream about. Average at the best.What really rocks about this camera is the video. It shoots as good as a camcorder without having to mess with the tape stuff. I love that! The 12x zoom comes handy, so does the stabilizer... And the flip screen... But what good do they do if the pictures are so-so.Basically, don't expect miracles. This camera looks like a CRT, but it is not even close.

LOVE that it has a eyehole viewfinder for those bright days that you cant see the screen all that well. Love the feel of the camera in general and all of its cool extra features --- but, that lens cap is a piece of crap! I tried and tried to get a new one, but none of them fit this camera... then i purchased a few extra lenses and the extention to put them on the camera... the lens cap problem was solved then! BUT, you have to KEEP the extention and extra lenses on it all the time if you want the protection! UGH! Then it's a pain to carry around! OH, and not to mention... that extention doesnt work so well if you are using the flash! The flash on the camera doesnt pop up tall enough to clear the extention!!!

cameras,"Delightful Images, Dissapointing Design for Canon S3","J. Wingard ""The Music Maven""",R3DNV3QARWPMRY,3,"I have recently decided to update my digital camera. I have been using the Canon A40 since 2002 and have been largely very satisfied with it (see my review and photos for the A40). The Canon S3 for me is the logical upgrade. I haven't purchased it yet but it was my favorite after examining the data on the Panasonic, Sony, and Kodak competitors. Well, after returning from a little time at the stores to get a feel for the various cameras, I have a couple things I think might be useful to other searchers that I would like to share:The Canon S3 is the most unintuitively designed camera in its general class. I thought the A40 was overly complicated and the S3 is worse. It has poor ergonomics but is better ergonomically than the Sony H2/H5 which I felt was nearly impossible to use one-handed. The Kodak Z710 was absolutely the best design with intuitive buttons and a wonderful feel in hand. I have fairly large hands but I found it very comfortable to hold and also had no problem taking photos with one hand or changing the settings. Yes, I like a camera that takes quality pictures but I don't want to be fumbling so long with settings that I lose the joy of a spontaneous moment of beauty either. Regretfully, the noise on the Koadak Z710 was unbearable to me even at ISO 100- worse than the noise on my old Canon A40 with it's relatively less substantial 2 MP resolution and 3X optical zoom. I just can't buy a camera that takes worse pictures than my outdated Canon A40 (the photos I've taken with the A40 beat out a lot of those taken with cameras I am reviewing here).The viewfinder of the Canon S3 is extremely dark as other reviewers have said and I found it absolutely impossible to use. It does have a lot of bells and whistles- some of which are entirely useless (menu themes!?!) and some which are highly attractive (color accent and color swap). The camera does produce some beautiful photographs with the excellent color that Canon is known for.If you can get past the two-handed photography and the viewfinder which protrudes uncomfortably past the camera body, the Sony H2 is an excellent choice. Depth of field is not as nice as with the Canon but the photos are still near professional quality and I know many happy users personally who wouldn't trade it for any other on the market.I have not been able to field test any of the competing Panasonic models, namely because I have been to 4 large retailers and one camera shop, none of which carry any of the Panasonic FZ series. I do have to say though that I am very attracted to the Leica lenses- very high quality lenses used in the manufacture of medical research equipment. And I've seen some absolutely amazing professional quality photos come out of them. If any of you out there in Amazonia have an idea where I can find a retailer that has the Panasonic FZ series cameras, please comment.If the engineers at Canon would have streamlined the Canon S3, it would be in the mail right now but with its ergonomic design shortcomings and higher price, I simply have to take a harder look at it's competitors.","November 28, 2006",0
cameras,A bit frustrating,D. Gastia,R3YZQXJNLIX34,3,"I got this camera in February of this year so I've been using it for about six months. My other camera is a Canon EOS Rebel 35mm SLR which I've had for years and love. The film processing was getting expensive though, so I decided to try a digital. I did have a Kodak digital camera several years ago but it was past it's usefulness and was taking horrible pictures. I was not able to afford a new digital SLR but wanted more than a point-and-shoot. When I found this camera I thought it would be a great compromise and the price was really reasonable.Having had an SLR I did not think it would take too long to get used to this camera. I was wrong. Six months into it and simple things like focusing are still frustrating me. I read another review which mentioned this; I have missed so many shots because this camera cannot decide what to focus on.For example, recently I had a perfect shot of a bee on a flower- I swear he was posing for me- and for almost 5 full minutes (it was a patient bee)I tried every conceievable picture mode and every time the camera would just not be able to focus the way I wanted it to. It would focus for a second and then when I clicked to take the shot it would blur out of focus. Even in Macro mode I was unable to get a decent picture. Every shot is fuzzy or overexposed. The same goes for any indoor pictures I take. I've also noticed that any movies I try making indoors always have a blue hue which I find odd.My frustration may partially be due to my unwillingness to read through the entire manual (I have skimmed). However, in my defense, I am not completely inexperienced with cameras and one would think that unless this was a hightly specialized professional camera (which it is not!) anyone familiar with SLR cameras should be able to figure it out fairly easily.If I do eventually realize that my frustration is due to something I'm doing wrong, I will update my review. As it stands I'm increasingly frustrated with this camera and beginning to regret my decision to buy it.","September 17, 2008",0
cameras,Highly over-rated,M. S. Henderson,R2OM0M21O1MGJV,3,"I decided to get an ultra-zoom digital camera this summer. After many weeks of reading online reviews and visiting electronics and camera shops, I finally decided to order the Canon S3 when the price finally fell to under 400 dollars. I have had the camera for two weeks now, and I must admit that I do not understand what all the glowing reviews are about. The camera is not terrible, but it is cluttered with tiny, flimsy buttons marked with icons or abbreviations that are not at all intuitive. It is virtually impossible to hold the camera without hitting one of them by accident. The manual is incredibly frustrating. This is not a minor problem. Nearly every entry has a parenthetical reference or footnote telling you to jump to another page. When you do find what you are looking for, it is usually written in the defective, non-native English that has become all too common in product manuals these days. I suppose the camera has all the wonderful options, settings, and features that I've read about hidden somehwere behind all those buttons or in all those menus and sub-menus, but I'll never figure out where they are or how to use them from this horrible manual. The LCD screen is OK, but smaller in reality than it seemed in the store. The viewfinder is perhaps the most disappointing feature of the camera. The resolution is very poor. The image is so heavily pixelated and fuzzy that I have no idea if the subject is in focus or not. As others have pointed out, the lens cap is cheap and falls off for no apparent reason. I didn't realize how annoying this would be. Even at the reduced price, this just should not happen. Most of the pictures that I have taken using the factory settings are OK, but not that much better than my old 3-megapixel Pentax Optio point-and-shoot model. Overall, I am not completely disgusted by the camera, but, so far, I feel no great enthusiasm for picking it up and using it.

I tried looking up how to solve this problem in the manual and their solution for blurry pictures was ""use a tripod"". HA! Why didn't I think of that?I don't know if there was any other solution because honestly, I do not have the time to read every word in the manual to find out.

It is so easy to accidentally push it that you'll find your pictures are grainy because the images were taken at ISO 400 or higher instead of ISO 80 or ISO 100. Secondly, the image size button is also located in the same area and guess what? It too can be accidentally pushed changing your initial settings to a lower quality/size image. If I'd known that this would continue to occur even after owning the camera for a long time and consciously checking it often, I would have returned it. It's the worst thing that can happen when you're trying to get the largest, highest quality image and you download it to your computer and find out the quality was reduced.

cameras,Anti-dust features not that effective,DJRob,R2WT553KQ22UGS,3,"Dust on the image sensor is a problem inherent to all DSLR cameras. Whenever the mirror box is exposed to the environment, dust can (and will) get in and get statically attracted to the image sensor. Canon, with the ultrasonic dust cleaning feature and the image-degrading dust delete and detection software, seems in principle to have solidly addressed the problem. Unfortunately, this does not impress in practice.If you are not familiar with how sensor dust appears in photographs, look at the sample in the Product Description, where they attempt to demonstrate the strength of the dust management features- or go to pbase.com and look at samples of the XTi from regular, everyday users. In particular, look for samples that have lots of blue sky. The dust will appear as spots/dots or splotches. The more your lens is stopped down (small aperture, >f10), the more prominent the dust spot in the image.I purchased an XTi body and Canon's EF 28-135mm USM lens from Amazon and, in my rather clean office, I carefully unpacked the camera and lens from their display boxes and immediately mated the two. I only had one lens, so the two were never unpaired. I took the camera on a mountain trip and was horrified to find dust spots on many of my shots. At first I thought I got something on the lens filter (purchased separately) but no. The spots appear in the exact same spot from shot to shot and become sharper if the aperture is stopped down. They are non-existent when the lens is wide or moderately open (shallow depth of field).Before I enflame a bunch of pro photographers, once I realized the dust was present on my images, I ran through the forced cleaning and allowed the camera to map the dust for removal in the DPP software. Subsequent shots of sky with small aperture revealed no improvement. Amazon instantly replaced the camera, but it was actually worse. After doing some research, I was led to the Giottos Rocket Air Blaster, but this just moved some of the spots to a different location on the sensor. I have an expectation that a factory fresh DSLR would be clean and free of debris on the image sensor. Even higher-end Canons apparently have this out-of-the-box problem- just google it. I refuse to resort to physical methods (swabs/fluid) to clean the sensor of brand new camera, the very act makes me a bit nervous.I would accept a dust problem if I changed lenses in the field, wind blowing and all, but this is not the case. However, the special dust management features of the XTi fail under the most benign conditions. I give the XTi 3 stars as a penalty for failing on the dust promise, but would give it 5 stars otherwise. It does take fantastic pictures, especially on photos taken with low f numbers and without big areas of light-colored objects.","July 17, 2007",0
cameras,Canon Rebel Xti,T. Prout,R2BDGZVRV3TTSV,3,"I was somewhat disapointed in the Rebel Xti, based more on the kit lens that comes with the camera 18-55mm. The lens is very slow, needs alot of light and honestly has not produced any better pictures than the Fuji S7000 it replaced. I should have bought the Canon 50mm 1.8 lens for the same money or waited and bought the canon 17-85 USM lense. I am also not thrilled with the spot metering of the camera. I would recommend buying the body and finding a faster canon or after market lens. I have not seen a significant difference in quality over the point and shoot camera's I own.","September 27, 2007",0

I took 150 shots at a local park, and i returned it for a Nikon D80. The D80 was night and day over it. Okay so i'm not going by features or lens availability, but just general exposure and sharpness, the D80 far surpasses it. I also tried the Nikon D40 before the XTi, which in my opinion is about the same as this, although the flash was better on the Nikon D40.No offense to Canon i'm sure they make some nice higher end DSLR's. I would save more money and get a higher end model or purchase from a store where they have a good return policy so it gives you a chance to test them out.Best Buy has a 14 day return policy. $600 is a lot of money just make sure you try them all before making your final decision.I tried 3 cameras over the span of 3 days.

cameras,Disappointed with underexposure issue,MrSporks,R2R6PXSE74OJ6V,3,"I had high hopes for this camera. I was impressed with all of the features and ease of use. However, after shooting around 200 pics with nearly all of them being underexposed, I have decided to return the camera. Most of my pictures were underexposed by 2/3 to 1 stop, and yes I know that I can easily use exposure or flash compensation, but after spending nearly $800 I figure the camera should shoot well without me having to do that. The underexposure makes the full auto mode completely useless, therefore none of my family would be able to use the camera. I know some people are getting this issue fixed after having sent their camera off to Canon, but again I don't think I should have to do this. I will move on to a different camera.","April 23, 2007",0
cameras,First impressions after upgrading the 300D,"Davide ""D.""",R33VPLB09TDX6A,3,"I'm using the 400D (aka Rebel XTi in the US) since two days. Not enough to give an impression on the quality of the pictures. Many things have improved. Most important the responsiveness of the camera. I only want to give an advice about two things that to me are definitly much worse that the 300D I had before.The main one is the size of the grip, which is much smaller. If I use heavy lenses, 5 minutes are enough to start feeling my hand hurt. Had I had the camera in my hands before buying, this reason would have been enough for me to go definitly for the 30D.Second one, less important: they have reduced the size of the battery. Now battery lasts less, maybe because the cell capacity has decreased, or maybe because the display now has to stay on much longer than it used on the 300D. I used my 300D battery charger also for my Canon MVX3i camcorder batteries. Now I cannot do that anymore. This was a little disappointing.In short, do not upgrade your 300D camera to this one without having held it in yur hands.","September 28, 2006",0

cameras,"Not for Soccer Moms, Sports Shooting, Others will Love It.",Baltimore Jack,RLT0BYQD2CGV9,3,"The D40 is a hard camera to rate because for some, it will be a 5 star camera, but others will regret their decision to buy this camera. If you are in the 5 star group, you will LOVE the D40. But . . . because of a decision Nikon made to save $$$ by leaving out an autofocus driver out of the camera body, if you want to add a lens to shoot your kid playing soccer, the D40 is a very bad choice, and you may be a dead man walking. Let me explain:The 5 Star buyer:If you are moving up to a digital SLR, and want nothing more than to use the kit lens (which is very good), then you will LOVE this camera: it is light, feels good in the hand, and puts out better looking JPEG files than the more expensive D70 and D50 cameras. If you intend to use this camera for general travel and around-the-house kid pictures, the D40 is a great choice, and I think you will be very, very happy.The 1 Star buyer:You want a camera for sports or telephoto shots of nature. This is not the camera for you, and here is why: the D40 has a DIFFERENT lens mount than every other Nikon DSLR which came before it. To save costs, Nikon left an autofocus driver out of the camera body, which means you must buy special/more expensive add-on lenses with the autofocus driver built into the lens itself.Why is this significant? Because of the 200 lenses made for Nikon DSLRs by Nikon, Sigma, Tokina, and others, only 20 or so work with the D40 with autofocus - something most amateurs will need to shoot sports and day to day photos. Many of Nikon's own consumer grade lenses, such as the 70-300mm G Zoom (Street price $150), will not autofocus with the D40. As a practical matter, this means that if you want an autofocus lens to shoot junior playing soccer, you must spend $525 for a zoom lens, the fantastic, yet pricey Nikon 70-300mm VR Zoom. That is almost as much as what you paid for the camera itself. The D40 is significantly limited in the number of lenses it will accept, and you really need to think about these limitations before purchasing. Moreover, what if your intentions change and want to pick up a cheap zoom for occasional use? With the D40, you can't, and I really think this is a significant limitation on this camera.But hey, if you are in group 1, this is a 5 star purchase, and you will be a very happy camper. Good luck!P.S. - In April, 2007, Nikon will begin selling the D40x, the same camera with an upgraded 10 megapixel sensor for $800 w/ lens.","February 23, 2007",0
cameras,"Nice camera, but significant quality issues","Amazon Customer ""Marty B""",R1U7UIMA4BGSQF,3,"I've now owned my Nikon D40 for a year, and while it is an adequate camera, Nikon's repair service leaves much to be desired.I probably fit the Nikon marketing department's ideal consumer profile: I used Nikon 35mm film cameras in the 1970s and 1980s, migrated to point and shoot digitals in the late 1990s, and wanted more creativity and control over my images. I purchased the D40 in December 2006 and used it extensively in a trip to Russia and Portugal this summer. I don't consider myself anything other than an enthusiastic amateur, but like the general quality of the photos I take with the camera.What works well:In its basic settings, the Nikon is simple to operate. Photos taken with its auto settings come out good, but not spectacular. I often found that shots taken of Orthodox churches in Russia, where there was a great deal of contrast between the building and the background sky needed a fair amount of touchup in Photoshop to make a suitable photograph. People pictures are generally good, and the D40 is small and light enough to take to family gatherings without lugging a huge weight around on my shoulder. The 18-55 lens is a nice one-lens solution for 90% of the photos I take.What doesn't work so well:I'm sure if I took hundreds of photos every week, I'd know the camera settings better than I do. Many of the creative controls that I'd like to use are far from intuitive on Nikon's busy body - lots of buttons, lots of menu choices, none of which are easy to remember or quick to find when the right shot comes into view. If Nikon was attempting to bridge the gap between advanced point and shoot and creative SLR photography, the bridge doesn't quite reach both shores, in my view.Build quality has also been a problem with my camera. About a week before my one year warranty ran out, my camera stopped taking pictures except under the brightest situations. The shutter simply would not fire, no matter whether I was using the built-in or an external SB600 flash, the 18-55 lens or a 55-200 lens. I sent the camera and lens to Nikon around Thanksgiving and tried to decipher the cryptic messages they left on their service center website. After three weeks, they sent back the camera without my lens. Messages sent to Nikon would take days for a response to return IF I got a reply at all. Today, my lens is still in their shop, waiting for parts six weeks after sending it to them. How Nikon can take six weeks to repair a lens is beyond my ability to understand. I had considered upgrading to the D80 before this lens issue occurred, an idea I've abandoned now.One other reviewer here commented on Nikon's aggressive pricing, and I agree, on the surface, they have a nice camera. But for the money, I wish I had abandoned my Nikon loyalty and bought a slightly more expensive and reliable Canon. I won't make this mistake again.","January 5, 2008",0
cameras,Not a bad starter DSLR,"Fox Mulder ""the X files""",R2L7I8FFQD5W2N,3,"Okay so decided i wanted a DSLR to use for some nature and astrophotography and other general shooting. I decided on the Nikon D40 because it had a lot of features and came well recommended. I made the purchase. After a day, I decided the 6.1 mega pixel was not enough for me and just the quality of some of the images where not to my liking, especially when trying to capture birds the size of a sparrow with a 300mm lens. I took the camera back and exchanged it for the Canon Rebel XTi. I took 150 pictures, and to be honest i didn't see much difference in quality.In fact the flash is much better on the Nikon D40 than the Rebel XTi.Other than that i was still disappointed. I went back again and then made my final purchase. Recommended by my brother who owns the same camera and i have seen the quality of his pictures. I opted for the Nikon D80. It was night and day, between the D80 and the Canon XTi or D40. Yes i paid a few hundred more, but the quality in nearly every single shot was excellent. I am now well pleased. Hope this helps. I didn't go into details of all the features, because to me what matters is the quality and sharpness of the pictures you will get.

I have to push the button at least three times to take one picture now. Sometimes even worse: the error message just keeps coming and I can never take one in some mode. The problem made me missed a lot of good shots.

I have followed suggestions from Ken Rockwell's site and others. In general the colors, especially the greens of grass and vegetation are very unnatural. The contrast also seems too high, but if you lower it at all, the photos become flat. Indoors with the flash, they colors and overall quality seem good. Outdoors, after hundreds of shots, I don't yet have one that is of the quality of my 4 year old 3mp Sony point and shoot.

cameras,"Four year old camera, time has passed it by",Land Cruiserman,R3F55JJ2CQT1DR,3,"Recieved this as a gift since I'm a ""Nikon Guy.""While this was a good camera four years ago, time has passed it by and it isn't as much of a BAD camera as for the price there are significantly better offerings. The three point AF system and 6.1 MP sensor weren't exactly industry leaders at the time it came out and today are paled by cameras such as the Rebel 1000D and the Nikon D3000. IQ and dynamic range is decent, but you'll see the differences between a 6.1 MP sensor and a 10. High ISO is VERY noisy, mostly owing to the outdated CCD sensor technology (vs newer CMOS sensors on all Nikons and Canons).The 18-55 ED II kit lens is the non-VR model, which is unfortunate since the VR is a big step up and has replaced it as a kit lens for the entry level Nikons at no extra cost.Lens mount-wise, this is an entry level Nikon mount WITHOUT the in-body AF drive so your lens choices are limited. This was a bad decision by Nikon, and they continue to do it to this day with the 3000/5000 series. 2.5 fps framerate is sluggish by today's standards, unless you're using the Canon Rebel series, limiting use to portraiture and landscape.In terms of logic and controls, those familiar with the D200/300 series of cameras will find the top LCD MIA, and a lot of dedicated buttons missing and have to chimp through the main LCD panel menus to get there. There's a reason higher end DSLRs have buttons everywhere and if you're used to changing settings on the fly with only the top LCD or viewfinder as your guide, get ready to navigate some menus and spend time staring at the screen, so I doubt anyone used to a prosumer rig using this as a second camera would actually throw a lens on it when used D80's are so readily available and cheap.I can't really recommend this camera since you can get a D3000 (a much newer and much better camera with the VR kit lens) for the same price or less.","April 22, 2010",0

cameras,6mp not great for cropping & enlarging,"Lizard ""lizard""",R27VNGHE0A6Y3S,3,"As a mom of 2 little ones, I was tired of missing pictures due to shutter lag with point & shoots. This camera helped to mostly eliminate that problem, and the quality of the shots I'm getting is phenomenal in comparison, so I'm mostly satisfied. But if you're like me, taking lots of candids and not necessarily having the time to zoom in and get just the right frame, you're going to want to capitalize on your great shot that was taken just a little too far away / not quite centered. Here's where the d40 will limit you. The far & away best shot of my 6 month old so far, for example, is from a slight distance, and due to the low MP's, I can't crop & enlarge to more than 4x6 without getting grainy. I did a LOT of research before purchasing this one and still feel like I bought the best DSLR for my money (d40x has slower flash sync speed, so I avoided that one), but now thinking I might have done better with one of the newer, high MP point & shoots, paricularly since I'm definitely an amateur and don't plan on purchasing more lenses.","February 10, 2008",0

I noticed the grainy pictures at the first couple of shots out door. I tried lowering ISO steps to 100, but that doesn't seem to help that much. I wonder how some people doesn't even notice the graininess, especially the professional photographer reviewer on previous reviews.Does all this kind of tiny sleek looking cameras have this kind of problem? My previous camera is a finepix E550, much bigger than SD1000. It's not a professional camera, but it does have whole lot manual mode I use, and even with full automatic mode, it produces much higher quality photo than the SD1000.I will probably keep this camera though and get a DSLR later on. I'll try taking some more pictures this week, see what it looks like.---Edit on Feb.11th 2008---My previous camera Fuji E550 was a real nice camera in the terms of picture quality. I bought a Nikon D40 DSLR now, and occationaly take the SD1000 on light trips. It's used more like a toy camera for me. SD1000 still takes grainy pictures in 200 and above ISO settings, so I always keep it as ISO 100. I think the grainy picture problem is common on all slim line cameras.

cameras,"Serious focus problems, and fragile",tedly,R2DNPT4BRLSNQG,3,"This is the first Canon I've owned, and while the size and shape of this thing are fantastic for carrying around, the picture quality is sorely lacking even for a little point & shoot.We had a Kodak EasyShare for several years until the sensor finally bit the dust (everything became pink all of a sudden), and we bought the SD1000 because of it's small size and the fact that it has an optical viewfinder. Cameras with only a screen can be very difficult to use in bright sunlight, or so we thought at the time. Nowadays, the screens are brighter and the technology has improved so that that is not so much of an issue as it used to be. I find myself never looking through the viewfinder at all with this camera, because it is really tiny and because the screen is easy to see in pretty much any light. The Kodak took incredible pictures for a little p&s; - bright colors, tack-sharp, and well exposed, often looking better than the ones I took with my Nikon D50. The SD1000 got great reviews so we expected the same kind of performance.THE GOOD- small, extremely portable, easy to fit in your shirt pocket or even the front pocket of your jeans. It's great for when you don't want to carry anything around but want to have a camera handy just in case.- Good quality video, including sound.

This is not something I was looking for when we bought it, but I'vebeen pleasantly surprised and started using the video function all the time.THE BAD- FOCUS! We are so tired of having unsharp or blurry pictures come out of this camera, I've had to restrain my wife from throwing it off a cliff. I don't know if it is an optical problem or a processing engine, but there are rarely sharp edges to any of the images from this camera. The closer the subject, the worse it gets, although 10 feet shouldn't be too much to ask for a camera to focus on, should it? I've seen similar examples of focus problems on othe SD cameras from flickr users.- Flash too bright. On closeups the flash washes out all color. The camera doesn't seem to adjust the flash intensity when the subject is close, and there's no way to do it manually.- Fragile lens. This is actually the second SD1000 we've owned. The first one lasted 2 months, because I got bumped in a crowd and the camera fell out of my hand while the lens was extended. It landed softly on a pile of jackets, but when I picked it up the lens was bent 20 degrees and wouldn't retract. Maybe it was a freak accident landing at the wrong angle, but it seems like it broke too easily. My wife went and bought a second camera immediately so she could take it on a trip, and this one has lasted6 months so far with no problems, but has never been dropped either.- battery life - probably not any worse than the average p&s; that's packed with features, but it won't last through a full day of tourist snapshots. Since it uses a special battery and not AAA's or some standard size, once the battery dies you're out of luck until you get back home and charge it up.Overall, this camera has been handy and the video feature has been fun. But the lack of sharpness just leads to disapponting results when other similarly priced cameras take perfectly sharp images. For that reason (and the fact that I have heard the same thing from other users), this will be the last SD series Canon I ever buy, despite how handy this thing is to carry around.","November 2, 2008",0

Luckily, I haven't had any problems with the lens jamming - but I'm somewhat disappointed by the picture quality. It seems no matter what light, the pictures are grainier than what I was hoping the camera would deliver. Not surprisingly, this issue is exacerbated by low lighting.As far as size, the camera fits perfectly into any pocket, and is fairly lightweight. I love the LCD response to turning the camera - though I find that I have to give the camera a light tap sometimes to remind it to flip an image in a given direction.I don't regret purchasing the camera entirely, I just really wish the picture quality was a bit better.","January 28, 2009",0
cameras,"One Year Later, I'm Less Than Impressed",R. Nichols,R39RE2XFZF1ON4,3,"After several hours of camera research I finally settled on this Canon Elph as a replacement for my HP Camera (the R707, I think) but one year later I find myself seriously unsatisfied with the performance of the Elph. True, it has many nifty sounding features, but in practice the little bugger keeps falling flat, specifically in the area of picture quality.Many of the photos I took with my HP camera were done with the flash off, often in burst mode, and the picture quality was awesome--super detailed and clear, not at all grainy. This was for the most part when I was taking photos outside in the sun, but I also got good results indoors with no flash. Cut to my first efforts with the Elph and everything is SUPER GRAINY, *especially* any pictures taken in black and white (one of my favorite ways of taking pictures).Even photos taken with the flash sometimes suffer from excessive graininess, and that's pretty frustrating coming from having owned a previous camera that captured things in such beautiful, clear detail. I have to say that when I replace it (which will probably be sooner than later) I'll be looking first and foremost at the new line of HP cameras.","May 28, 2008",0

Using a zoom function on Photoshop to compare details, a picture taken with my old Sony Cybershot 5.0 MP got far way more details. Every time I use the no-flash function, even with enough light, the resulting picture is a low quality one. The pets-children function (theoretically, this function allow the camera not to be affected by suddenly movement) is practically useless; very nice product otherwise.Ideal for amateur-low exigent users.","November 21, 2007",0

I had read that the TZ5 would prove superior in this regard, but it turns out only minimally so.I have spent the last two days putting the TZ5 through its paces and comparing it shot by shot with my Canon SD870. The Canon blew it away time after time, especially in low light situations. I was looking for a camera that would give me the same quality image as the Canon SD870, but also provide a more substantial zoom range in a small package. The TZ5 fell short. However, I don't know of any other compact camera outside the Lumix TZ line that offers anywhere near the zoom range, so it does benefit from occupying a very unique niche.My advice: If you need the 28-280mm zoom lens, it's your only option.

cameras,Happier with my Canon SD870 IS,N. Roberts,R2GILVLVHW0FYX,3,"I bought the Panasonic TZ5 because I usually buy Canons and wanted to see what else was available in the compact camera market. I wanted a camera that was lightweight and pocketable - two words that I would not use to describe my Canon G9. I wanted image quality that was good enough ""as is"" - clear detail and accurate color without requiring me to fix it. I was not concerned with lots of manual control - I have my G9 in my bag (but not my pocket).I was not especially impressed with the TZ5 when I played with it at the local Best Buy, but I attributed that to the floor model being pretty beat up. After receiving one from Amazon, I compared the results with my wife's SD870 IS; both inside the house and outdoors. Indoor pictures were very yellow with the TZ5 - none of the white balance settings yielded good results. Outdoors, the TZ5 tended to wash out images and lose fine detail. In automatic mode, the Canon consistently turned out better pictures (in my opinion) than the Panasonic.In the end, I'm going to return the TZ5 and get an SD880 IS. The Canon is smaller, lighter, and produces better looking pictures; too bad it can't also have that fantastic 10x Leica zoom lens.","December 31, 2008",0
cameras,Great stills but awful video,"Phil28 ""Gadget Guy""",R3GAKM5YKL5BTQ,3,"I found the still images to be excellent, as good as any other small camera. I shot about 90 images over two days and all but 3 were mis-exposed or out of focus. Color, sharness and exposure were consistently good under a wide range of lighting conditions. One setting identifies the kind of scene being shot and adjusts appropriately. It worked well, focusing on faces in portrait shots and identifying backlit conditions.But, I'm sorry to report, the video performance was very disappointing. I found the videos to go in and out of focus when shooting a subject under bright cloudy skies, even while the subject was at a fixed distance, and I did no zooming.I reread the user manual and it said to turn off the continuous focus setting when taking movies. Could that be correct? Apparently it is, based on other reports of owners that talked with Panasonic tech support. But what happens when someone moves closer or further away? Isn't that what movies are all about? Moving subjects with action and some activity?So I did some checking reading dozens of on-line comments and reviews, and while most reviewers mentioned the issue, none classified it as a deal breaker. The most interesting discussion was on the Panasonic Forum on DPReview where many reported they contacted Panasonic, only to be told ""What problem?, This is the first I've heard.""Clearly if the camera has to revert to a fixed focus mode to take movies, this is a huge defect. While much about the camera is very good, this is a deal breaker for me. I did try making a number of videos in the fixed-focus fixed and they were slightly better, but, unfortunately a lot worse than my Canon Elph 900 that's several years old. As a result I have returned the Panasonic camera to Amazon and will wait for this either to be corrected or the next model that hopefully will not have this defect.I would only recommend this camera to those that don't want to take movies.

cameras,great except for audio on movies/not great in low light,"faffie ""woodworkingchick""",R30ZQHERV2AQQ7,3,"I bought this camera because it works smoothly with my Mac and because it shoots HD movies. I know the purists say you should have a dedicated movie camera if you are into shooting home video, but I find a good quality compact digital camera is much easier to carry around and less intimidating to your subjects when you're aiming it at them. I have a Sony DSC t100 which is an awesome little camera, but it doesn't interface well with my Mac (no audio on movies), and I have to run the footage through Roxio program on my PC to convert to AVi, then copy the AVI files to my Mac. Tedious and time-consuming. I find Sony's proprietary memory stick to be annoying as well. I also wanted to upgrade to a compact digital that shot movies in HD. I like to use stills from my video footage in my finished IMovies and HD video allows for pretty good stills. I loved so much about the DMC TZ5, but the it struggled to focus in low light and the audio for my finished movies was very poor compared to the Sony. You can really only hear the person shooting the footage clearly (if he/she avoids covering the poorly-located microphone with his/her left index finger), and you miss a lot of the dialogue of the subjects. This is a huge flaw if you're doing home movies, since some of the best audio comes from side comments and reactions. I used the camera for a few weeks and did some short films on my Mac, but I just couldn't get past the low volume of the audio track. The microphone barely picks up audio more than a couple of feet away. I did extensive research before buying it and did not see this issue mentioned anywhere, so I am afraid I will never know if the audio capabilities are up to my standards without trying the camera out first.

If I was a US settler surely I would pack and return it back.","July 15, 2008",0
cameras,"slow, slow, slow",D. Husch,R2FRIERWVN3GPI,3,"The main reason for getting a camera with a 10x zoom is to take pictures of birds and wildlife from faraway. Often when you see that lovely bird you only have 3 seconds until she turns and flys away. So its really critical that everything about the camera aid to getting the perfect shot quickly.I found everything about the TZ5 to be slow. Power on 2 secs, Power off 1.5 secs. Power on, zoom to 10x, focus, shoot about 8 seconds. Time between photos 2 seconds, time between flash photos 6 seconds.On the top is an options ring to select photo, video, or special photo modes. If you are storing the camera in your pocket, its easy for this ring to turn. So next time you turn the camera on and are ready to photgraph that perfect eagle with winds spread, and just get the message, ""dial is in wrong position"". A similar problem occurs with the record/playback switch. If you forgot to leave the camera in record mode, there is another 10 seconds while our beautiful eagle is flying away.Yes i recently went on a trip, and i saw a lot of beautiful birds, but i missed literally 60% of the good shots due to these design issues.An SLR camera such as the Canon Digital Rebel EOS would be good for getting fast response.Another point is that this camera has an externally telescoping lens. This is a big reason for the delays in powering up and down as the lens has to pop out and in each time, which also consumes significant battery power. My previous camera, Sony Cybershot DSCT300, had a fully internal lens system, and it could take the first picture in 1 second. On our tourbus we went sandboarding and everyone got covered with sand, and sand in all the pockets. Almost everyperson who had an external lens (including my tz5) had malfunctions with the lens system after. So dont take a camera with a externally telescoping lens to the beach, unless you are prepared to be super carefull.","October 1, 2008",0

Sorry Panasonic - I really liked this product, but you need to know that this one issue blew it! I agree with all of the other reviews regarding positive attributes. I liked the video quality, but when I played back on my HDTV, through good speakers - how terrible.To be honest - the sound quality is so bad, I could not even enjoy any video at all and my family actually made fun of my technology for the first time! How demoralizing!I do have a suggestion however, try out the new Sony T500. It's great - pretty good pictures (TZ5 is a bit better in this regard), but the Sony Video, WOW!!!

cameras,Disappointed,B. Hayes,R1CNA7Z2AN1G50,3,"I had been waiting for this camera to come out for a while, now that I have played with it for a few hours, I must say I am disappointed. I don't think that there are enough tech upgrades to get this model over the TZ3. The so called HD video is not HD by any means, and there are serious audio sync issues with the video I have taken. The videos are VERY grainy indoors, but better outdoors. The biggest issue is the very SLOW focus mechanism when shooting video, it's terrible. The main reason I waited for this camera was to have the option at better quality video, with the functionality of a P&S; camera. It's quite large for a P&S;, and frankly, there are other cameras out there with as good, if not better PQ in a smaller package. As far as the camera functionality, not much different that the TZ3. I don't think the extra pixels are worth the price. All I can say that it's going back to Amazon. BTW, Amazon, how about filling the ""air bags"" in the shipping box with actual air.

cameras,Nice features but way too much noise,the engineer-historian,R2X04BXNK1VNEW,3,"I bought the A590 as a camera to keep with me in the book bag/briefcase that I carry around most every weekday. You may recall the old saying that the camera you have with you (when you see a photo op) is your best camera. The A590 fills that role by virtue of its small size combined with full exposure control. The big problem is that the noise generated by putting 8 mpix on a tiny (1/2.5) sensor chip can overwhelm the image and render detail moot.I use Imagenomic NoiseWare combined with Photoshop Elements to reduce noise and sharpen the image as best I can. If possible I shoot at the lowest ISO setting, 80, which lowers the noise. I never go over ISO 100 if I can help it, and usually at -2/3 on the exposure control. It's much better to have the photo-editing software brighten up the image than the amplifier boosting the signal (and noise) from the sensor. When you play back the image on the camera's LCD, it should look a little dark -- never overly bright (which can also blow out details).Here are two other items about the Canon A-series cameras. My 15 year old son uses a Canon A720 for what are essentially snapshots and is very happy with it. If you don't crop substantially and aren't too picky about sharpness and noise, the camera is quite capable. From what I can tell, the A720 uses the same electronics (including the sensor and image stabilization) as the A590. The A720 has greater zoom capabilities (and hence a different lens system) and is a little bit larger and heavier. If I were going to get just one of these, I would go for the A720 because of the zoom.The second point is that the other camera I frequently use is a Canon A650, and it is far more capable than either the A590 or A720. The A650 has 12 mpix on a larger sensor (1/1.7). Comparing sensor sizes (available at [...]) and mpix shows that the A650's sensor has 1.75 times the area as those of the A590 and A720 with only 1.5 times the pix -- hence pix density is lower and the noise generated by the A650 is much better controlled. And because there are more pix, the noise gets smoothed over as a result of more little points covering the same area in the image. (FYI: Greater pix density on a sensor chip creates more noise.)I did a noise and sharpness test with all three of these cameras plus my Nikon D40 DSLR. I set two shoes, one black and one brown (the latter with lots of texture) on a rug, just beside a sunlit spot inside my house. The shoes were well lit but not in direct sun. I shot all of the cameras at 200 ISO (because that is as low as the Nikon would go) and f/5.6, with the exposure control at -2/3 of an f/stop.The results surprised me. For whatever reason, and despite several tries, I could not get the Nikon to focus adequately on the shoes -- this from a distance of about four feet. I know from experience that the Nikon D40, with 6 mpix on a 2/3 sensor (2/3 the size of a standard 35mm film frame) has extremely well controlled noise and excellent sharpness, but the inability to focus here took it out of the comparison.The superiority of the A650 to the A590 and A720 was startling. Keep in mind that I ""zoomed"" in on the images in Photoshop after I had transferred them to my 24"" iMac (a great computer for photo editing). This made different sections of the shoes appear much larger (the laces were really telling), and the 12 mpix A650 (vs. 8 mpix of the others) had more pixes to work with for any particular area I looked at. Nonetheless, the other two cameras had so much noise that the details were overwhelmed and no amount of noise reduction and sharpening could change that. The A650's image was far sharper and clearer.The A650 has one other big advantage so far as I'm concerned and one drawback. The advantage is the articulating LCD, which I find extremely useful for many shots. Yesterday, I had to lay down on the cold, damp ground to get a shot with the A590, but with the A650 I would have put the camera at foot level and looked down into the cocked LCD. That is really nice, almost addicting. However, the A650's drawback is that it's bulky and surprisingly heavy, which is why I don't carry it along all the time.So you pay your money and take your choice -- or, like me, pay your money twice and have it both ways. Remember, the camera that you have with you is the best camera you own -- so think about what size and type of camera you want to carry plus when and how you will use it. For some people, that means owning more than one camera.","April 4, 2008",0

cameras,A590IS - Awful battery life,"Mattie's friend ""offshore1""",R2UHJNIMIP9CV8,3,"I've had the PowerShot a590IS for only about a month now. I didn't expect the two AA batteries or the SD card that came with it to be anything spectacular. They weren't. Replaced the card with a 1gb eFilm PRO SD card and solved that problem. But the batteries -- After the supplied batteries quickly died, I replaced them with a pair of 2300 mAh Lenmar rechargables - fully charged. I expected to be off and running with a reasonable amount of battery life on hand. Not so. That wretched little, red low battery flashing icon came on in less than two hours of non-constant camera use. Two additional, freshly charged, batteries had the same result. I'm thinking this may be partially my fault as I did use the LED screen and flash about half that time. But I really do think I should have gotten more use from these batteries. So, I have purchased a pack of four Sanyo NiMH, Eneloop batteries and await their arrival. I did a lot of research on which batteries to purchase and try, and these seem to come out on top. It is claimed these particular batteries don't leak juice, just sitting there, the way others will. I have a Nikon dSLR and a Canon SD870IS and I'm just not used to low battery life. I wish this a590IS had the same type of battery that's in the 870. Perhaps I see the need to change the approach I have of tending to battery life with my use of the a590 camera. I've shut the LED off (on the 590) except for a few seconds of post-view after a shot. I have to use the LED to compose with the 870IS, but won't with the a590. I also find that the 590 gives me a ""softer"" print than the 870, but I can live with this. I really only want the a590 as a camera that can travel with me that I dont have to worry about. But, it would be nice to get some mileage out of it if I'm along the coast of Maine, or some such place for the day where it would get a good amount of use. I do really like this a590IS, but give it only three stars because I have no confidence in it's ability to last a reasonable amount of time. It hasn't done that yet. Perhaps the new batteries and my new approach (which I don't really think I should have to take) will make a difference here. I'll edit this whole thing if that's my experience after a reasonable amount of time. Maybe I should have gotten the updated Canon SD880IS and use 870IS as my travel companion. That would have been a great idea, but the 870IS is too expensive for the casual attitude I could have with the a590. Again, I do like the a590, but it does chew up the batteries - at least for me. I hope that changes. If it does, I'll report that. Until then. . . ._______________________Well, It's been almost two months since the above post. A very helpful person replied and suggested a stronger battery - but, please read on: The four Sanyo Eneloop batteries arrived and I purchased four 8X Energizer Lithium batteries (+/- $11 for either 4 pack). I took two of the Eneloops right out of the pack and put them in the camera. It's well over 200 shots later now and the Eneloops appear to be still going strong. I have become a believer in the Eneloops and now have the confidence in the A590IS that caused me to give the camera only three stars earlier. I have two of the 8X Energizer lithium batteries in the camera case for when the Eneloops need to be replaced, only to be recharged. The 8X Energizers are not rechargable. I have since purchased four additional Eneloops along with the charger for these batteries. Around $15, on sale, at Amazon. The Eneloops (and, possibly the Energizers) will eventually replace, and become my only AA battery. The Sanyo Eneloop batteries are only 2000 mAh, but they don't loose their charge the way other rechargables will while just sitting there. I don't seem to need anything more than this 2000 mAh rateing. If I could change the star rate of the A590IS, it would be to four stars. Not five because I would like to see a wider field of view at that end, and I do find that sunlight in back of me does diminish the LED effectivness - but the optical viewfinder is there for those occasions. I suppose the camera would be more expensive if it overcame these two points. So, it was the batteries all along. Sanyo Eneloops solved this and I expect the 8X Energizer lithiums will be good also. I would report on the Energizers, but the Sanyo product doesn't seem to want to give up so I can try the lithiums. Just a moment to say that I keep the camera on aperature priority or progrm so I can keep the ISO at 200 (manually set), or below. Others have complained about noise, but I haven't seen any at these ISO settings. It's good to have the confidence, now, in this nice little camera.","February 17, 2009",0
cameras,I've learned not to trust customer ratings.,J. Ungerleider,RINGWVR4T0L4X,3,"I bought this camera for it's price. I wanted something that took a good photo and if I needed to replace it (or I lost it), it wouldn't be a total loss. The camera's pictures are pretty good, however, it's response is very, very slow. To boot up the camera, focus on a subject, and shoot a picture takes up to 20 seconds. Pressing the shoot button often results in a 1+ second response. If you are not perfectly focused on the subject(s) (i.e. when taking a picture of 2 people, if the center focus comes to rest between the subjects) the foreground comes out blurry.Overall, it's a good camera for someone who has never had a digital camera before.

cameras,"Owned for 4 years, average camera user",thevoices824,R2G0K3F3ZW4X98,3,"Reviewed 7/29/2012I have owned this camera since spring 2008. I mainly wanted a camera with image stabilizer with decent zoom. I mainly use it for everyday pics and for concert settings. I needed something that does well in lowlight settings. With flash I'd say 80% of the pics are very clear in a lowlight setting. Without flash I'd say it drops down to about 60%. The video is decent. There is some noise when taking video at such a place as a concert. Especially when watching on the camera itself. On a computer the video sounds much better and the picture quality is pretty clear. But don't try zooming while shooting the video. It will blur the picture. Also I find sometimes the video will blur while taking even not zooming. It's really a 50/50 shot.The zoom is pretty good. I can be about halfway back in a concert crowd in a small venue and still get good pics. But don't try going beyond the 4x zoom into digital. It will blur the farther off the 4x you go.I love the big LCD screen, definitely a huge plus.Love the AA battery. I hate non standard batteries. I've had friends who their cameras have run out of battery life in the middle of a concert. So replaceable batteries are a must. I guess it really doesn't have good battery life. I can't give an estimate but I probably had to change the batteries at least once during a concert (which includes taking pictures earlier in the day as it's usually a road trip to the show). But it never really bothered me. I just carried a couple extra spares.I can't comment on the different settings, as I only ever used auto and video modes. They worked well enough for me.The flash will take a minute to recharge between pics. This can be annoying, especially at a concert (or I would assume when trying to capture children). You have to hold the flash down for a couple seconds before it takes the pic. Between pics also takes a couple seconds. The screen will go black until it's ready for the next pic.The camera is a nice size. Not huge and bulky, but not very small either. For me it's a perfect size. I will miss this camera as it's served it's purpose quite well for my average uses.A couple problems I've had. I'd say a little over 2 years or so after I bought it the battery compartment wouldn't shut all the way. I had to put a hairband around it to keep the battery compartment closed. But it still didn't close completely, resulting in a low battery warning all the time. Finally, my camera has hit its end. It will no longer even stay on for more than a couple minutes. Even with fully charged batteries. and just about a week ago my flash stopped working. I must admit I am hard on cameras. This one has been in my purse, in my pocket at shows, has been dropped, etc. So for the abuse it has taken I think it's lasted a good length of time.Honestly for the price, I wouldn't buy it. I got mine for $160 four years ago at a local retail store. It was on sale at the time and was originally $250. I can't believe how much the price is now for such an old model. I really wouldn't spend the money and buying a used one would be just as bad, as with my experience the more it's used the less it'll last and you'll end up having to buy another camera a year or 2 later.If you can find it new for no more than $180 then I'd say that's a decent deal. But when I saw over $400 here I was flabbergasted.[...]. I never review stuff and I really put thought into this to help others.","July 29, 2012",0

I bought the 590IS for its image stabilization feature and the fact that it was 8 MP. I am disappointed. I have had more blurred pictures with this camera in three weeks than I had in the entire period of my ownership of the other two cameras. The viewfinder, a good feature not available in many new point-and-shoot cameras, is unreliable in terms of coverage; I never had this issue in either of the earlier Canon iterations. The color is spotty. The battery life is terrible. The motion pictures, at higher resolutions, are only 20 fps, rather than 30 in the older camras.

Very disappointed at Canon for putting out this subpar product.CONS:-Pictures are soft, almost out of focus.

If it falls, it is toast.-Screen is larger, but also are the pixels.

This applies pretty much across the board to most point and shoot cameras, and smallish electronics - they're just not comfortable unless you've got young nimble hands. Why can't these manufacturers take into account those who are a bit physically challenged as well?

My usual camera of choice is a Canon digital SLR, but I wanted a small point-and-shoot digital for times when I can't carry my big camera around.This camera is okay. The photos taken indoors with flash are often dark and a bit grainy, especially if the zoom is used at all. I'm rarely happy with the way my indoor shots turn out. It does best outdoors - those photos have much better color and brightness. However, in auto mode it does a poor job with moving objects - they always blur. I have to play around a bit with the other modes to see if I can get better action shots with it.In summary, this camera isn't as good as I hoped, but it's better that having no camera at all.","May 19, 2008",0

I had a Canon Powershot Elph a few years ago, a 5 megapixel camera. It took amazing photos and had great speed between pics. So that's why when it broke, I chose another Canon. I picked this model because it is a little bigger than the Elph series (and less expensive). It was so slow to recover after shooting one picture (so that I could shoot the next one), I sent it back. I then bought the Elph model, but didn't notice much difference in the time between shots. Also, the material the new Elphs are made of is lighter and felt flimsier than the previous model I owned. The A590IS, while being 8 MP, didn't seem better than my 5 MP. In fact, quality of picture was a bit worse.","December 20, 2008",0

cameras,Over-rated Canon SD1100IS,E. Epstein,R1YE42WWFSVUW7,3,"Just bought the SD1100IS to replace a 1-1/2 year old Casio Exilim EX-Z850 that I broke. I checked out all of the reviews for this new Canon model and was impressed with the comments. But after receiving the camera and using it for a few weeks I am beginning to have my doubts. In fact, right now I would happily give it back to have my Casio Exilim back!1. Slow, slow, slow - the setup time for every shot, particularly indoor shots, is really annoying. My Casio was ready in about half the time.2. Grainy images on screen for any nightime indoor shots.3. Severely under-powered flash - I thought I read some reviews that gave it an OK rating at 10 feet...try about 8 feet and you might be more accurate. Many flash shots were severely darkened by lack of light...and often the flash only covered a portion of the image leaving faces dark and everything else in the photo bright.4. Used it last weekend for a wedding - roughly half of the shots had to be thrown away...you don't get a lot of opportunities at a wedding. Things move along at their own pace. So walking down the aisle, every other shot was blurry, or out of focus.5. Face Recognition software worked sometimes, and other times drove me crazy as it would not lock in anywhere near the faces....I eventually shut it off.6. The pictures - well yes it does take nice pictures...if you're willing to put up with a very annoying camera. Maybe I'll get more used to it over time.

Yes, the quality of the photo is excellent and it has many features, however, I did not read one single review which commented on the problem that the date and time is not imprinted on the photo when reviewing the photo but can be imprinted when printing out the photo if selected.What good is a photo when the date and time is not on the photo. Nikon and Casio camera imprint the date and time on the photos taken. The user has the option of turning off the imprint should it be necessary.I work as a residential property manager and frequently photograph rental units after the tenants have moved out in order to prepare the refunds of deposits. I have a nice Nikon 5.1 MP but the shutter time is extremely slow. I end up having to wait 5 seconds before being able to shoot the next photo. You can imagine how frustrating it is to spend time waiting in between shots.The problem of not having the date and time imprint when I download the photos on my notebook makes my work very difficult. I only print out photos when necessary, therefore, if I move the original photo from the memory card to my notebook computer, I can not print the photo with the date imprinted. The date can be imprinted by connecting the camera to the printer and selecting this feature.Do not purchase this camera if you need the date and time imprinted on the photo without having to print. Get a Casio Exilim because the quality is just as good and the menu is user friendly unlike Canon's.Canon needs to go back the drawing board and add this important feature.","August 5, 2008",0

cameras,xsi auto focus issues,Lelan Powers,R2DTWORRA5LPO5,3,I don't usually add to post but I felt that I need to help others with deciding on the purchase of the XSI. My situation started in January of 09 when I bought the XSI along with the 50mm f1.8 and the 55-250mm IS lens after reading extensive reviews on the internet before I purchased the camera. After receiving the camera and lenses I started to see a focus issue very quickly with the kit lens. I then contacted Amazon and they promptly sent me a new XSI camera. When I received that camera I used both kit lenses on both bodies and they both had the very same AF issue when you use the center focus point. When I used the 50 prime and the 55-250mm IS with both camera bodies neither of those lenses missed the focus using the center focus point. I never was in auto mode always in shutter or aperture mode. Every picture with the kit lens was clearly very soft and out of focus. I then returned the first camera back to Amazon for credit and I sent the second kit lens to Canon for recalibration. When I received it back from Canon I then started the process again and there was some improvement but they were all out of focus using the center focus point or any one of the 9 individual focus points. I then started to experiment with the camera by using aperture priority and center auto focus point and I would use the AF shutter button pressed half way and then switch to live view and the image would be out of focus so I would refocus in live view and it would nail the scene every time due to the fact they use different focus methods in live view. This is unacceptable. Furthermore when I contacted Canon CS they portrayed that I was the only person that has had an issue with the XSI and the kit lens. Even after I got the lens back and contacted Canon CS I got the same response about me being the only person with this issue. I still thought it was my technique but I can tell you that after 3000 pictures with the camera I cannot be that BAD there is an inherent problem with the communication between the kit lens and the body of the XSI period! Canon can say what they want but after taking the camera to 2 different professionals we all came to the same conclusion. I know the kit lens is NOT L quality but the kit lens should perform to the same standard as the 55-250mm IS lens and if not then back to the research for a different camera and that is when I am after 2 months of frustration with the camera. The lack of Canon recognizing the true issue and being able to fix it really has me stumped. I could have sent the body and the lens back to Canon at no charge because they sent me a return label but my time with Amazon return policy was up so I had no other choice but to return the 2nd camera that I tried to like. If you would like to see the pictures I would gladly send them to you. You can contact me through this site I think?Lpowers,"March 13, 2009",0
cameras,Auto focus points could be better.,Bubba,R2AX8DA7MH6KDO,3,"This review is for the newcomer to DSLR's and not the advanced user. So we don't need to hear the experts bashing on how someone doesn't know what they are doing and shoudn't get a camera like this. I am speaking for the person who needs a camera to capture their kids in the school play, soccer game etc. and can't capture the moment with a point and shoot. You can't expect awesome pictures if you do not learn how to use all the settings, features, and purpose of an SLR camera. You might even get worse pictures than your point and shoot. Sure an SLR has an auto feature where it will figure what is the best settings to use for a basic picture, but you also end up with a basic picture.But even all said I would still recommend an SLR and a good zoom lens that you can afford. It is worth spending the money because you can never recapture that moment of your child or whatever your trying to capture. How many pictures have you taken with a point and shoot that were horrible because they were too dark or blurry? Sure they are fine if the lighting is good and you are within 10 feet or so away. Any further than that well, why bother. The larger zoom type cameras are better but are still limited when lighting is an issue. The pocket type point and shoots usually have a lag time between shots or flash charging up again. So forget about getting off several shots in succesion. Hard to capture a picture if the object is in motion also. The larger zoom types have mimimal lag time and some can even fire off bursts of 3 to 5 in a second with one push of the button and better at capturing something in motion. But they still can't beat an DSLR. I have gotten shots of my children with an DSLR with low lighting and no flash from many rows of seats away and they were great. The image quality was even good enough where I can crop it and still look good. People using their camera phones crack me up, but that's another story.I am not going to get into all the technicalities of this camera. You can read the other reviews for that. I just want to mention that if you are one of those people who need to step up to an SLR because the point and shoot couldn't do the job but don't want to become the serious photographer then this inforomation might be what you are looking for.I find the XSI pictures are soft and not crisp. Some photographers prefer this. The new Nikon DSLR's take crisper pictures, and they are less expensive.The main con of the XSI is the focusing points. If you use the camera in auto mode then it will focus on the nearest or most identifiable focus points it can focus on. So it might focus on an object in front of the actual thing your trying to capture that is behind it, or on a purse or print on a shirt for example instead of the persons face or what not. If your trying to get a group picture with the guest of honor in the middle of it, you might not have that person in full focus but instead the preople around because the cameras focus is focusing on the most vivid or closest points. You can set the camera in one of the manual settings and pick one focus point of your choice, like center, top, left, right etc. but you can't pick all on. In auto it will focus on more than one but like I mentioned before, not excactly on what you want. you can press the shutter button half way and it will try and refocus on different points or you can get closer to your subject and press the shutter button half way and hold it so it keeps that focus point and then you step back and snap the picture. Well you don't have the luxury of time on your hands for those kid or spontaneous shots.So this is where I recommend the newer Nikon DSLR's. Their focus points I find tend to focus on more points and usually on the center also where my subject tends to be. The XSI was here and there. If the area your focusing on is busy, the XSI will pick a few focus points here and there were it thinks are the best. But with the Nikon, I found it to focus on more points which is nice because the whole image will be more sharper instead of certain areas of it when cropping or zooming the image on a computer. Unless you are going for the ""bokeh"" effect in which the subject is in focus and the area around it is blurred.A camera of this size isn't always convienient to carry around to all occasions because of it's size, accessories, worries, or whatever the reason. If you already have a pocket point and shoot or zoom camera, don't get rid of them. I keep them for when I go on vacation because I don't want to carry a big DSLR around on vacation. I use the pocket one for when we go out and I don't want to carry anything bulky and for those you never know shots. I use the zoom one for the amusement parks. It's small enough where it is still manageable where I can toss in my backpack. I use that one for the amusement parks because I can get pictures of the kids on rides. The zoom and speed is adequate enough where I can get pictures of the kids in the distance or when their zooming down the roller coaster. One day I might get rid of my pocket one and get a waterproof one, that way I have all my bases covered. Ha ha.But when you learn how to use a DSLR's features coupled with a decent lens, man the pictures are like night and day.If you still find that a DSLR is just too much over kill for you then you might want to check out the Nikon S8100. It is a little higher end point and shoot that is a little larger than your average point and shoot but it takes amazing pictures at a distance and in low lighting and has HD video capture with stereo. My nephew has the older S8000 model of this and I was blown away at the pictures and videos he took at my childs play. And we were sitting way back. They made improvements on the S8100 where it counted so I can't imganine how good it would be now, wow.I would recommend you try out different cameras and brands in the store and decide which one suits you. Look for optical zoom, optical image stabilization, and good low light capability.","November 14, 2010",0

The color sometimes seems to be washed out even though there's no over-exposure. My now-sold Nikon D70 is much better than this cheap camera.

The associated speedlight couldn't communicate with the camera resulting in underexposed, blurry night pictures. Then the camera began shutting down intermittently. I had to put it back in the car for several minutes until it began to operate again. Finally, after over an hour of annoying, unannounced shutdowns it started doing what it's supposed to. The pictures it takes are nothing short of spectacular. I love the design and the interface. Overall a great camera. I'm afraid, however I will have to stick with my erstwhile Canon S2is. It may have fewer megapixels and tons of scratches and scars but it always turns on and takes pictures no matter what. Canon makes great cameras. They dropped the ball on these.","January 4, 2010",0
cameras,Why not buy a 40D when the prices are so close?,T. E. Kaldas,RYY0TM6FKS2PR,3,"You have the choice of buying a XSi for 800 dollars (body only) or buying a Canon 40D for $950. I can't see why anyone in that position would choose to go with the XSI. The build quality on the 40D is infinitely better. It has weatherproofing and a magnesium alloy body. It's shutter is rated for 100,000 shots whereas the rebel series has been rated for about half that (That means the 40D could last twice as long for 150 bucks more). It has a much better and clearer viewfinder; a pentaprism instead of a pentamirror. It is faster in terms of burst shooting and can reach faster shutter speeds than the XSi (1/8000 sec vs 1/4000). It also has a much larger memory buffer for when you take bursts of photos. The 40D can be pushed to 3200 ISO while the XSi tops out at 1600. This is a big deal when shooting in low light. The 40D also has longer battery life.Further, most people will never use 12 Megapixels. 10 is perfectly adequate. I can understand buying an XTi over a 40D. The XTi is half the price. But for the small difference the 40D is definitely the smarter buy when compared to the XSi. If the price comes down, then the XSi will be worth it. Until then. Do yourself a favor and get the 40D. Just my two cents.My three stars are strictly based on a price to performance consideration. I'm sure the XSi performs great. Canon dSLR's are excellent all around.","May 28, 2008",0
cameras,Parts are plastic :(,"Jyn Meyer Design ""-Jyn""",ROK5PQL50QY3N,3,"Okay so- I will keep it brief and to the point. If you DO get this camera, GET THE EXTENDED WARRANTY.This was my 2nd Canon DSLR. My first was the Canon Digital Rebel XT. After having it for a year it just... didn't power up one day. Bringing it into Wolf Camera they said it wouldn't even be worth fixing since there wasn't even a guarantee it would be fixed and the minimum charge was already extreme (via the Canon repair charges). So it's an expensive paperweight.Then my husband got me the Xsi. I was happy. But it DOES have a click life. So, after so many clicks... it literally breaks. After a YEAR of having the xsi, I got an F shutter error code. We cleaned it but nothing fixed it. Finally realizing defeat, we opened the thing and took out its guts. To our HORROR the shutter cog was made of PLASTIC. The teeth on it literally were worn and a few were worn down to nothing. Had this been a copper piece even, it would have lasted YEARS.

cameras,Outdoor picture quality is dissappointing,P. Reusch,R1IKKLP3RTTX66,3,"I've had this camera for over 1 year. I am very disappointed with the quality of outdoor shots. Whether sunny, overcast, or cloudy, all of them seem to be over exposed and cool in tone. I have to manually edit every picture in Photo Shop to adjust the color but because of the overexposure the pictures still seem flat. I have 5 different EF lenses of decent to excellent quality and it does not make a difference which lens I use. Also, auto focus which was once very crisp is now very soft. Quite frankly my, small digital point-and-shoot takes better quality pictures than this digital SLR. Even though I've always had Canon camera's I was seriously considering purchasing a Nikon instead of this camera because I was not happy with my last canon camera (A95). But, after so many years I did not want to judge Canon based on one camera. Well, because my last two Canon purchases were extrmeley disappointing I will not buy another and I now regret not purchasing the Nikon.June 6, 2011 - There is another post thinking perhaps the focusing issue is a problem with the user and not with the camera. Sorry, not in this case. I am quite experienced. And again, I need to emphasize, the camera took excellent pictures at first, but the quality has slowly deteriorated over time (I have had the camera for over 2 years). If teh poor picture quality was due to inexperience I would have had the problem right from the beginning.I will not buy another Canon.","July 5, 2010",0

cameras,first time dslr users beware,"saguaro ""kimber""",RVV2UIN5IVE9B,3,"I have only had this camera for a few days but I feel compelled to warn users who are looking for their first dslr camera. I read many, many reviews and comparisons and yet did not realize that this camera does not shoot video, while the Nikon D5000 does shoot video and does not cost a lot more money and gets very similar marks on all other aspects. (I found the Nikon d5000 to be less than $100 more than the Canon rebel xsi).I also was very disappointed to realize, upon reading the manual, that the ""live view"" is no where near what I was expecting. It is only ""recommended"" for use with a tripod because camera shake will cause the images to be blurred. (that is directly from the manual). Being optimistic, I tried it without a tripod anyway, and it is true; all shots I took while using the ""live view"" are blurry to some degree, even when using the flash. I guess it's true that you have to use the view finder in ""grown up cameras"" (aka: dslr cameras).I have owned a Canon Powershot (not dslr, it's a great point and shoot) for a few years and it has video (which is superb even in low light, not dark, but low like indoors in the evening) and it is always a ""live view"", but that's a given because nearly all point and shoot cameras are. my friends who own dslr cameras warned me that when I was ready to move up in the world of cameras, I was going to have to get used to using the view finder instead of the view-screen to set up my shots. Well, I thought I could stay in my comfort zone using the view-screen by buying the Canon rebel xsi because of the ""live view"" feature. I believe now that is it more of a gimmick. But I do realize that this is spoken like a true point and shoot user, not a pro photographer.Every dslr owner I know insists that once you get used to it, using the viewfinder is much better, so I can adjust to using the viewfinder. (even though my baby thinks I've turned into an alien when I put the camera up to my face. so much for making her smile while holding the camera out to the side like I did with my powershot.) however, at this point, it's mostly the ability to shoot video that I am really missing. I feel pretty dumb about not seeing that little fact when researching, but even when I went back today looking at more comparisons, I still don't find many reviews/comparisons that really point out that difference between the nikon d5000 and the canon xsi. The comparisons mainly focus on the image quality. Which, by the way, I am truly thrilled with. The Canon seems to be holding strong on it's reputation of having the best image color and quality in the business. (to my knowledge)I just think that for that price range ($550-$650) the fact that one can shoot video and the other can't is a very big difference that new-to-dslr folks should know.","December 20, 2009",0

cameras,Don't discount the lens mount error,Amazon Enthusiast,R3NI8QM9FPIGP7,3,"The D90 was my first step into DSLR and I chose Nikon because of 20+ years of good past experience with a rock-solid (and very basic!) N2000 and later the digital Coolpix 950. I bought my D90 in June 2009 and for several thousand images it fell in the category ""you shouldn't ever feel this close to an inanimate object"". I like the way it feels in my hand and its weight isn't a problem for me, although I've seen a few negative comments about that. I'm happy with the bright display. The batteries have lasted well. The controls are where they should be for a Nikon. It was solid: you can easily freeze the hummingbird in the air and the water droplets falling from a dolphin at its apex. It had the kind of responsiveness that you'll recall if you've worked with plain old SLRs (and minus the ""lag"" of the older non-SLR Coolpix!).It'd be safe to say I love almost everything about the camera...*except* that I've recently run into the F-- lens mount error. I'd read Amazon reviews before buying the camera, but blew off what people had writtenYou can read more about the problem (and 18-135 lens kit) here:[...]and in the results of a Google search of ""d90 lens error"" or similar.I've removed the lens, cleaned the contacts, etc. but quite often now I'll be squeezing a shot and nothing...sometimes jiggling the lens or remounting fixes the problem. Even slight pressure on the side of the zoom can correct the problem.All I can really say about the problem is that if you don't have it, you'll probably love the D90. If you *do* have it, it's really a deal breaker. In any situation with a moving/changing subject, you almost never have a second chance once you've nudged the lens a bit and tried to clear it. And having that confidence in your equipment that it will work reliably when you need it is unspeakably important.Without the lens mount/electrical contact error, I'd give the camera the highest rating. As is, I now have to figure out what the Nikon terms are on servicing the camera, determine where to send it, etc. All I really want now is to have this camera back working correctly because I think it's a beautiful piece of technology when working.","November 8, 2009",0

cameras,Say no to Live View,William Jefferson,RL8Y4W364ZXIU,3,"The ""Live View"" feature is not usable to take still photos. It takes several seconds to do autofocus and the shutter delay and mirror vibration are significant.When the camera is in Live View mode, the mirror is flipped up, the shutter is open. Autofocus is done through software image processing through the image sensor. It takes at least two three seconds to focus on a subject with good contrast. And often the autofocus goes into ""hunting"" for several more seconds before it settles down.When shutter release is pressed in Live View, the camera closes the shutter, drop the mirror then lift the mirror and open the shutter. All these actions create a long shutter delay and significant vibration.Because the mirror is held in the up position and the shutter is open in Live View, it consumes a great amount of battery charge and produces a great amount of heat for the circuit.It appears that Live View is released before the design is ready.Another problem is that Nikon changed the raw file format. Weeks after the camera is on the market, the raw image file format is still not supported by PhotoShop or Nikon's own Capture NX2.","September 19, 2008",0
cameras,Useless Video,"xraylady ""xraylady""",R18AJNK7NU7Q4S,3,"This camera is fantastic for wide range of still shots. However, it took me a long time and lots of investigating to understand why all the videos I shot were out of focus. It's because there is NO autofocus in the video mode. This is NOT described anywhere in my user's manual. Buyer beware!!!! There are ways around this if you have enough light and a subject that stays the same distance from the camera, but I find using the LCD to confirm focus manually is very difficult. Even when I preset the focus before turning on liveview, I am not confident looking at the LCD that it is really in focus. Any point and shoot camera with a video feature will do better for quick little videos than the D90.

cameras,Problems,nightowl57,R59GVP15DEPC,3,"I am a photo enthusiast and have previously been shooting with a Nikon D50. I enter this review with mixed feelings. I received my Nikon D90 around Jan 4th this year and was instantly amazed with its ability. Because of my previous experience with the D50, it did not take long to get accustom with the D90 and was quite surprised at the ease of familiarizing myself with the new camera. I did try to read up as much as possible because I feel that is the most importand thing to do in photography, knowing your camera inside and out. For the first two weeks, I would say it performed beautifully,as expected. However shortly there after I began noticing pictures that were grossly underexposed speradically through a shoot. I shoot sporting events indoor with various lighting. Here are my usual settings. ISO-1600 to 2000 with High ISO NR on,WB-K at various settings depending on lighting, burst and single exposure modes, AF area mode-Dynamic area,Center focus point-wide,Meter-Center weighted. I shoot approximately 200-400 photos over a period of about 3 hours with several breaks throughout the session. Photos in question are almost completely backed out but look as though they are very underexposed with just hints of the subject on the outer edges. These photos will be scattered about the shoot so it has been very difficult to pinpoint exactly what might be going on to cause this but I have been very surprised with that this is happening. The last session, I had about 25-30 of these misshots in a little over 400 photos. The Customer Service Dept. has been very gracious and helpful to try to resolve this problem and after talking to Nikon USA and Amazon Support, I have a new camera being shipped as a replacement. I am very pleased with this as I feel like it is a defect with the camera and did not feel like this problem should be showing up this soon. The D50 never has had any problem like this but it does not have the setting capability that the D90 has, so I will not try to compare their performances. I hope the problem is with this particular camera and not the model. I am a Nikon fan and will continue to be but this is a discouraging chapter in my history with Nikon products. I will certainly update my review and star rating after I have had a chance to use the new camera.","February 10, 2010",0

cameras,Not fully compatible with Nikkor AF zoom lens,Ken Ho,R1ZJHFJQYN0OU1,3,"Per product description, I expected D90 could drive my old Nikkor AF zoom lens.

Also, for those ones it can drive, it works at only one aperture setting.Another feature I looked for in this model was the LCD display of live-view. However, D90 needs a button to turn on the live-view. The button is at an inconvenient position. To take the photo, we need to press the button to shut off the live-view first. This is a clumpsy operation. Canon uses a photo-sensor to perform the same operation, which is much smarter than Nikon in this sense.D40 uses a CCD sensor.

For the first week the camera worked well, but after two usages the LCD screen became pixilated and the camera was sent to Panasonic for warranty repair. The warranty department stated that NO EXTERNAL DAMAGE IS COVERED AT ALL. Regardless of the fact that my camera was clearly brand new, and that this was obviously some defect in the camera or screen, Panasonic was unwilling to stand by their product. Instead Panasonic stated ""We can replace your unit with a factory reconditioned unit. This product, its operation and its appearance is like that of a new unit and it carries a 90 day warranty."" The cost would be an additional $135.50 for this reconditioned unit. So basically I would pay $535.50 for a reconditioned camera with a 90 day warranty. I have asked for my unrepaired, defective camera back and have been waiting for a week for the tracking number.

cameras,"Somewhat disappointed, especially when compared to Sony DSC-H20",Steve N,R2Y7OH9W808IP9,3,"I've had a variety of great digital cameras, but recently found myself wanting/needing a compact, super-zoom, HD video camera. The choices came down to the Panasonic ZS3 and the Sony CyberShot DSC-H20. Hands on is the only real way of determining which is best for a person, so I bought both to do a direct comparison. After a week of comparing these two cameras in daylight, low light, night shots, and video here is MY conclusion (individual mileage may vary...):I'm keeping the Sony H20; it has to be one of the most underated cameras being sold today. I'll only summarize at the end of this review why it is so much better for me than the Panasonic. But now for some specifics about the Panasonic ZS3.Pros:Great screenOptical zoom while video recordingSmall sizeWide angle lens (25-300mm)Excellent IA modeHigh quality videoCons:Terrible low light and night shot capabilityVery poor strength flashInability to alter shutter speed/aperaturePoor color reproduction (compared to Canon and Sony)Focus when zooming during video not very accurate or rapid...even when continuous AF and Pre-AF have been turned off (or on for that matter)Excessive noise at telephoto end unless bright sunshineCan't use 3rd party batteries as a backup with the 1.2 firmware update which my model came withNo fluorescent light white balanceThe Panasonic ZS3 is not a bad camera (It was better in some ways...video primarily, than the Canon SX200is), but it's picture quality is not up to some of the Canon and Sony models I've used. I've also owned the Panasonic TZ5 and came to the same conclusions. The biggest problem for me however, was the dismal low light capabilities. I'm not trying to shoot in the dark, but I'm also not always in a small room and close to the subjects where the flash MIGHT work. I like to use the camera at concerts and in cities using the ambient street/sign lighting.The Sony H20 on the other hand has EXCELLENT low light and night shot capabilities! Also the video is just as high quality, you can optically zoom during video recording, and the focus seems quicker during zooming. You have an abundance of manual controls in addition to an IA mode that seems just as smart as the Panasonic ZS3. And the final point in favor of the Sony is the image quality comparing identical pictures taken under the same lighting, time, zoom, etc. conditions was much better with the Sony, especially at the 5-10X zoom level. The noise level was much less even at ISO 800 with the Sony.The cons for the Sony would be the lens cap, slightly larger camera ""thickness"", and the ""not so wide-angle lens"". However for me, the wide-angle lens issue did not bother me as I rarely take any type of group pictures needing a super wide-angle lens. Remember, that's how I use a camera; this may not work for you, but don't count out the Sony because of that.Control responsiveness and shot to shot speed was similar in both cameras. Both cameras have excellent build quality. Battery life was similar...around 250 pictures with 30% of that using the flash and 30 minutes worth of video.Hope this has been helpful and at least gives you some things to consider about you camera needs.","August 8, 2009",0

I would say F30 takes incredible pictures in low light ( I still remember how disappointed was a friend comparing the performance of his new canon G series with my F30 during sunset on a cruise ship )and in daylight scenery. I also think Canon takes great pics in good light with a lower indoor performance than F30.When I decided that its time for an upgrade, I determined that I need something that will enable me to increase my technical skills with at least 10x zoom for close ups and my wife insisted we have something taking decent videos (preferably HD recording). As I did 2.5 years ago I went online dpreviewdotcom, found the superzoom comparison read it to the end, downgraded my options to Panny ZS3, Canon SX200 and Sony H 20. I went on with amazon reading almost every posting about them. I ordered ZS3. It came in 2 days and here is what we think of it:Build:Its solid and have a sturdy feeling, I would not criticise anythingDesign:I think usage of buttons was pretty practical however you got to used to the menus.BatteryI could take 153 pictures and 18 small clips (less than a minute) with a fully charged batteryZoom + FocusI think the major strength of this camera is its decent wide angle zoom and focus.VideoHD video is a great plus and its stereo sound is amazing we connected the ZS3 to our HD LCD TV and did really enjoy the outcome. Plus my wife loved the dedicated camera record button...However for me it all comes down to image quality. So I will share in brief of my experience in different conditions:INDOORunbelievebly poor. We were not able take a good pic of our 1 year old standing accross the room. You would not believe how poor quality (dark and grainy) was the images ok it took slightly better one in 6-10 pics however still not comparable to my old friend F30. Where is the difference between a 10Mp and a 6 Mp gone? I went to the manual. read from the beginning but there is actually little you can do about it and it helps only 1 in 5 pics. I could never understand how a camera takes incredibly different pictures in the same mode just between couple of seconds on and on.OUTSIDE DAYLIGHTI took some pics with friends than took several more from the top floor scenery at 4.30 pm with ZS3 and F30, came home and looked at my computer. I was totally disappointed with the performance of ZS3 comparing to f30.BEACHThan we went to beach, it was almost 7 pm and took a dozen more pics, same scenes with different modes. When I reviewed them on the computer I decided to send it back and order Canon sx 200. (Ok some will say (posted here already )that this is a superzoom suffering in low light because of smaller ccd sensor, there are a alot of details or print outs will be good and I should have practised more... etc.My answer is, I am sorry but thats not my problem. When I pay a camera over 300, I want to be able to take a decent picture of my kid when I want to without suffering taking 5 pictures for a good one. Plus I hate photography processing with software on the computer, simply dont like spending time for it.)This time I did not want to make a mistake and went to a bestbuy and came across Canon and Sony H20. I will not make another comparison just say that I ordered Sony H 20 giving Canon couple of more years to improve on the compact superzoom segment. Hope this helps and saves time. Thank you for your time.","September 14, 2009",0
cameras,Disappointed Given the Glowing Reviews,Firelock1776,R2YCHU12LZTH2F,3,"I own a Canon G7 and have been pleased with it, but I am tired of having to add attachments for wide angle and telephoto. (I also use DSLRs at where I work for professional photo shoots.) Canon's G-series cameras are great, but bulky and I wanted a smaller camera that would easily fit into a jacket or shirt pocket. I always research my purchases thoroughly and so having read at least a half dozen or more reviews of the Panasonic ZS3 and the Canon SX200, including comparison reviews, I decided on the ZS3. The optical zoom in video feature, and sharpness of the detail of the sample photos on the review sites, are what swung my decision. I ordered the camera from Amazon and waited a month for it to be delivered.Once I got the camera I tested it for several days. My first tests were indoor portraits and stills. These came out comparatively poor to what I was used to with my Canon, and the shots were just plain bad if they were done in low-light even with the ""night portrait"" setting enabled. The camera does not do well in low-light conditions, a problem compounded by a VERY weak flash. For example, if you are trying to take a photo in a room that is not well-lit, unless you get within a few feet of the subject, the camera's auto-settings will jack up the ISO and shutter speed to compensate for the weak flash and you will get a dark, noisy photo. I tried adjusting the limited manual overrides so it would not adjust the ISO above 400, but the photos continued to come out noisy. I then broke out my monopod to help stabilize the camera. This helped quite a bit as the camera was able to lower the ISO and shutter speed significantly and the photos came out much brighter, but still not nearly as good as any Canon I had used. From what I can tell, the optical image stabilization on this camera is not as good as what Canon uses. I figure what Panasonic is doing is simply increasing the ISO and shutter speed to compensate for hand movement, rather than using ""optical"" stabilization. The result being dark, noisy photos in low light. As I had my old G7 at hand. I was able to take comparison photos from the exact same position and lighting and they all came out looking much better.OK, low-light interior shots are not great, but what about outdoor day shots? I took the camera for a stride through downtown Dallas about lunchtime, and took a variety of shots, including some interior shots at a brightly lit restaurant. These all came out looking great. In particular, the sharpness of detail was excellent. However, late in the day (about 7pm in late June) I took some shots when the sun was lower in the sky, certainly not twilight by any means, but simply not direct sunlight. Now the shots looked like they had a blue film on them to me. The skintones of my subjects (my family swimming in the pool) were way off, contrast was low. Generally the shots look flat and lifeless compared to what I was used to with my old Canon. So I took out my Canon and in the same light conditions took some photos. They looked superb compared to the Panasonic. That sealed it for me and I decided to send the Panasonic back to Amazon.The next day I bought a Canon SX200 and was pleased with every aspect of the camera. Color balance of the photos is much better, contrast, powerful flash, good low-light performance (for a point-and-shoot), and better build quality than the Panasonic. The video on the Panasonic was better than the Canon, not only could you optically zoom, but I think the video may be just a little sharper. So if video is the most important feature to you, then the Panasonic would be the better choice. I would also say that, if your subject is very well light, you may be able to get better detail out of the Panasonic lens on at least some shots. But in general in my opinion it is so difficult to get a really high-quality photo out of the ZS3 that I don't think this is a good enough reason to recommend it over the Canon.Summation:Pros:Excellent video qualityOptical zoom in videoExcellent photo detail in well-lit conditionsSmall and light (fits easily in a shirt pocket)Cons:Poor low-light performanceWeak flashRelatively slow zoom (the SX200 is faster)On-camera software is primitive lookingColor balance and contrast lackingExpensive considering the photo quality","June 28, 2009",0
cameras,Proprietary Battery and Average inside picture quality,Chris,R2D4QC92DYDSKQ,3,"This camera replaced my Canon Powershot. After about 6 weeks of usage, the inside pictures are just not measuring up to my Canon. What attracted me to the camera was its wide angle and zoom features - after the first week we were going to return it, but chose to give it some more time - now its really too late to return it, but over all this is going to be more of an outdoor camera. Also, you should know that this camera now has firmware that prevents any battery other then a Panasonic battery from working, so all the generic brands that are sold on Amazon will not work. What is most disturbing about this is Panasonic made this decision without ensuring adequate supply. The battery is not available on Panasonic's own web site, my local camera stores, and its very difficult to find on the web. Amazon will have it in stock the end of December, for $50.00, a mark up over Panasonic's list price of 40.","November 25, 2009",0
cameras,Pictures okay...video great...but had to return!,D. Ivey,RC1M7GF0STROZ,3,"I purchased the DMC-ZS3 after MUCH research as I needed to replace my beloved Canon Powershot A620 (after we both suffered a nasty fall in the mountains). Unfortunately, Canon no longer makes the A620, nor do they make a replacement model in terms of size and features. Bought the ZS3 because of the size, type of lens, HD video, and quality of the LCD monitor. I compromised a viewfinder and the convenience of using AA batteries for size and hopefully, picture quality. I wasn't blown away by the picture quality, but to be fair, only took about 40-50 shots. Took a short video, which looked great (maybe even spectacular) on my large screen TV, and sound quality was surprisingly good. BUT.....I was very disappointed in the battery life. Batteries exhausted after about 50 shots, 30 seconds of video, and maybe a combined 30-40 mintutes playing with the features (scrolling through menus, etc., but turning the camera on and off quite a few times). I had read enough to know that you can't use one of the thousands of off-brand batteries sold on e-bay and elsewhere, so I ordered a genuine Panasonic battery from a very nice gentleman in Hong Kong. After I charged this replacement battery up and it wouldn't work in my camera, I called Panasonic. The battery was the right model number, but I was told that Panasonic made a firmware upgrade to this camera and that the battery would no longer work in my camera. ALSO...Panasonic had not yet manufactured any replacement batteries that would work with the new upgrade, and would not have any available until 9/18/09...SO...it was impossible for me to have an extra battery to take with me on my vacation which starts on 9/20/09 (pausing a day at Disney World to charge my one and only battery was not an acceptable option!). I returned the ZS3 to Amazon several weeks ago for a full refund (Thanks Amazon!). I purchased a Canon SX10 instead (3X the size, 3X the weight, but lots of features I love including a swivel LCD, viewfinder, and AA batteries). I will have to say that the video on the Panasonic ZS3 (HD) is superior to the Canon SX10 (not HD). Haven't used the new Canon enough to know if I'm really happy about picture quality yet. There were some things I really DID like about the Panasonic ZS3: super bright LCD, super light weight, and really user friendly menus and controls. I did accidentally hit the video button a few times....maybe it should be in a different place, but the camera is so small, I'm not sure where they'd put it. Didn't like the proprietary cables (what is with that?) and of course, the battery issue was a deal breaker. I wouldn't rule out purchase of a Panasonic camera in the future...if they make some changes, and would have kept this camera if not for the battery issue.","September 13, 2009",0
cameras,ZS3...ok but could be much better,"M. Holdridge ""Mike H.""",R1T8JCNNH7GUVM,3,"great little camera if you're taking casual OUTDOOR photos of your kids. Color are rich and vibrant; however, moving indoors into low light situations, the images turn noisy and the camera has major issues focusing especially at full zoom (+low light). I definitely would have bought the Canon SX200 if it had the ability to optically zoom while shooting HD video like the ZS3 does. Another downside -- there's no spare batteries available from Panasonic right now. WHY!?!?!?!?!?! I've never heard of anything like this!!","September 16, 2009",0
cameras,NOT FOR PORTRAIT PICTURES,C. Yu,RUPRIQQZFN1TM,3,"I purchased this camera based on reviews I have read here and the [...] comparison ""Compact Camera Group Test Group 6: 'Compact superzoom' cameras"". I've had this for about two weeks now. Other cameras I own are Casio Exilim EX-S10, Canon Powershot A1000IS and Sony Cybershot DSC-T77.Other cameras I considered were the Canon SX200 IS and Sony Cyber-shot DSC-H20. I'll skip the good features as most of the reviews here have pointed those out. Here is a list of what I don't like about this camera:Perspective Distortion - I don't recall seeing this in any of the reviews but this is a very obvious flaw of this camera. I have a 6 month old baby and I take her pictures everyday and as often as I can, mostly indoors (at home). At 1x zoom setting, this is very evident. The wide angle lens causes this effect, with the portrait image warped.Low Light Portrait - As I have mentioned, I use this camera mostly indoors and using the AI feature, most pictures show dark exposure. Skin tone is also darkened. I have a Sony SR-11 HD video cam and it takes better pictures at low light conditions.Battery Life - I was only able to take 200 pictures after recharging the new battery overnight.Proprietary Battery - I tried searching for an OEM backup battery but can't find anywhere online that says the battery worked. All battery reviews I have seen say they don't work with this camera, even OEM ones.Dial for Setting - The settings' dial on the camera doesn't firmly stay in place and often gets dislodged, which causes an error message. This is easily remedied but it is annoying because the slightest bump on the dial will cause this.I wouldn't recommend this camera if you will be using it mostly for portrait pictures. If you are looking for a camera that will be used mostly for zoom photography with HD capability, then this will work.","September 11, 2009",0
cameras,Love some things... Others... not so much!,M. Silva,R2RDVS4ALXJ169,3,"This camera is loaded with features and the it does do alot of what it claims. It does zoom really well. However, the more you zoom, the worse the quality of the picture. Still something worth having in many situations. I took a shot of my husband down by a swimming pool from my eighth floor condo balcony on vacation. I was surprised that I could get as much of a shot as I did.My biggest disappointment was when we went out on a whale watch in the bay. It was daylight, overcast and I couldn't see ANYTHING on my screen. Every shot was a gamble because I had no idea what i was going to get a picture of. It was sooooo frustrating. I know all LCD screens have this problem to some extent, but this was ridiculous!So, for indoor shots or shots from a shaded area, you're in business, otherwise, outside in the outdoor light it's a crapshoot!!","March 16, 2010",0

cameras,OK,D. Smith,R38MUOXO8J5Z1P,3,"For all the great reviews, I thought this would have been a better camera. The shutter speed is SLOW. Make sure to use a very fast card with this one. In fact, a slower SD card won't allow you to take video. When it works, the pictures are great. Unfortunately, because it is so slow, most (75-80%) of my pictures end up blurry, I've never had this with any other digital camera I've owned, so I truly believe it's not user error. It's not a good camera for taking pictures of kids in action - mainly good for portraits. The video is convenient. Unfortunately, when you zoom in and out, you can hear that motor sound on the recording so I try not to use that feature. I only wish I read the other reviews about this before I bought the camera.I'm not pleased with how few good shots I get, so I'm off to find a better camera. I have a Panasonic video camera that I love, but not this digital point and shoot.","February 9, 2011",0
cameras,Blurry in low light,ian_alexander,R2E4MEU19FTUHM,3,"Bought it after reading lots of good reviews but was disappointed. Had to return it as most of the pictures if not under bright light are somewhat blurry. Not very usable indoors unless using flash. Much worse than my 5 year old Olympus C4000 which is an excellent camera taking low light pictures. Switch to Canon S90. S90's pictures are not as sharp as Olympus or Panasonic when printed but they look good on computers and it performs better under low light, it's also smaller and easier to carry.","September 26, 2010",0

cameras,Shutter delay breaks the deal,Truth Tell,R39K38RHNXJVQ7,3,"My wife and I own the TZ1 and like it a lot. So we ordered the ZS3 to upgrade. After all, this is the fourth generation. There is indeed big improvement in several areas. The picture quality is superior, video is also vivid and clean. But there is one thing that trouble me and wife--shutter delay. Maybe we got a lemon, this particular one has about 1 second shutter delay. (This can be verified by shooting the 'second' hand of a clock.) For video recording, it always misses the first second of the action. To make thing worse, when you end a video recording, it will end half second earlier. Note, for the shutter delay, I am not comparing it with my DSLR; I am comparing it with TZ1!!We really like the quality of the pictures and video, but we cannot accept the slugish shutter delay. So we returned it. The new ZS7 is coming out, and last I read, shutter delay issue will be addressed. (Apparently, I am not the only one have this issue.) We will try ZS7 when it become available.","February 7, 2010",0

On top of that you need to be an engineer to be able to buy a replacement battery unless you want to wait for 2 months and buy the original Panasonic battery for US$ 59.

cameras,"Great Camera... BUT.... Panasonic has a ""gotcha!!""",D. Lang,R2A9JNXZ191OYY,3,"The camera is new for me so I have not had a lot of time to delve into the intricacies but so far the camera seems to be really nice. The purpose of my early review is to warn customers that Panasonic has made it that you cannot use any 3rd party battery. (Almost always less expensive and with more power.) They claim it is under the guise of ""safety"". I think we all know it is probably because of money. I would have looked at other cameras had I known that Panasonic practiced sabotaging their customers and am considering returning my ZS3. Maybe if enough people complain to them....After a year of use... a few updated opinions: Good picture quality but now some disappointments. No way to configure ""fill flash"" (or decrease flash strength) which is always important when shooting people. Faces most always too bright. Another is that my camera's screen broke just by putting the camera in my back pocket and sitting in my car. I even had a screen scratch guard on it. Manual configuration clumsy. Too many silly auto-configuration settings. Cannot charge battery in camera. Expensive compared to competitive models.","December 10, 2009",0

Some points from me.(If you've ever used any DSLR camera, please skip this review, as u will be disappointed by the image quality of this camera)Hardware:1. Wide Leica Lens - Big Eye!! Cant love it more (5 star)2. Panasonic Body - Quite disappointing one, esp the dial, very loose fit. (3 stars)3. Body size - bulkier than expected, can be classified as (semi compact) (4 stars)Performance:1. Good Image presents only under ISO 100 (3 and a half stars)Any picture taken using iso 100 and above proved to be coarse.Reason: Small cheap CCD sensor. This CCD sensor cant match the lens, I reckon this as a design flaw. I think Panasonic probably had to cut down the overall building cost to ensure profit. FUJIFILM's 200EX has a better sensor.2. Reliable Face Detection (5 stars)Makes point-and-shoot more enjoyable. Even in some very dark environments, it still works!! yes, very dark, I mean it!)3. Very Underpowered Flash (BE VERY AWARE OF THIS) (2 stars)One very obvious FLAW of this model!! For most of the indoor lighting conditions, pictures would incline to be underexposed.4. Clear Large Screen (resolution can be larger...) (4 starts)5. Speed (4 stars)Start up in 2 secs, focusing getting slow and inaccurate in poor lighting condition. Electronic Shutter could be faster...)Overall (3 stars with reservation)Its been over-hyped. Thought this camera is a good attempt from Panasonic, but still cant beat some of Canon's premium wide angle compact models(such as SD850 IS).I am a journalist and probably will stick with Canon as my 2nd camera (expecting S90)","August 27, 2009",0

I passed up the Canon Powershot SX200IS because it didn't have optical zoom when taking videos. The ZS3 had everything I was looking for--sharp pictures, long zoom, great video with optical zooming and stereo sound, small size, wide angle, etc., except the picture quality is not so good. I tried out this camera at my grand niece's birthday party and everyone came out pale-looking especially when I used the flash. I tried out all the settings and compared the images side by side with the images I took with my old Canon SD800IS, and the Canon beat out the Panasonic except for the sharpness--the Panasonic do take sharp pictures. However the colors on the Canon came out more vibrant than on the Panasonic, which came out dull and washed out. Sure the Panasonic takes sharp pictures and nice HD videos with stereo sound, but overall the still images to me are not good. Also, the camera is too fragile to carry around without a case, I was always afraid of scratching the LCD or dropping it because of its smooth body.After two weeks of use, I returned the Panasonic to Amazon. This is the third Panasonic camera that I had bought and returned because of poor image quality. The first and second were the FX07 and FX50 two years ago, I see Panasonic's image quality has not improved much.

cameras,Another small-sensor camera,tagger,R27T0Y9DBD6HDN,3,"Sadly, as we demand smaller cameras with greater pixel counts and zooms and thus even smaller CCDs, Nyquist rears his ugly head and gives us pictures which aren't as good as our ""old"" pocket-sized cameras took. I have a Canon PowerShot A610 and at only 5MP it takes better pictures in low light conditions. I don't mean candle-light, I mean just about any indoor or slightly dim setting. Granted, my old A610 doesn't zoom as far or take HD video, but I'd gladly have traded the super-zoom for a larger CCD so that I could have a pocket camera that took nice pictures and HD video, but wasn't microchip-sized with an over-zealous zoom. (Indeed, though, Leica can make a fantastic lense! Over-fantastic for this camera, sadly.)I've never before written reviews on my purchases, (new year's resolution to write more, perhaps?), but this camera overly underimpressed me. Indeed, the HD movies are pretty impressive, and with great stereo sound, to boot!, and in the right lighting and set to the right setting, it can take very nice pictures. Nevertheless. The dozens of scene modes are slow to sift through and don't always give the best picture for the setting (I took a picture of some candles in various scene modes, and no, not ""night"" nor ""starry sky"" nor any of the other appropriate scene modes worked best; rather, the ""underwater"" scene was the best fit for that candle shot! If only I was able to set ISO, aperture, and shutter myself...). Not much exists, out there, that is very satisfying in this way; I've begun to look at DSLRs and now the new micro-4/3 cameras just to get the bigger CCD, though it's harder to find something that takes nice HD video with stereo sound. So you can see that I'm not really the best candidate for this camera (or to review this camera). But I didn't realize how bad the problem would be until I started taking pictures with the camera. Ug, the noise is bad at nearly all ISO levels. :(However, Amazon is really pretty fantastic. My zero-trouble return completed without a hitch.

First of all the ZS3 has advantages on portability, and its ability to zoom while recording video. But that's about it! Images are blurry when you zoom in to take shots; the video is more like SD quality, other than HD 720P; pictures are very grainy and noisy in night shootings. In my view the Canon SX200i delivers better image and video quality; it doesn't get as much noise as the ZS3. Manual setting can sometimes help to minimize the noise or lighting issues but the ZS3 just can't do it.

DOESN'T OPEN OWN AVCHD VIDEOS from a camera (.MTS format) for editing. A BUMMER! It's a must for such an expensive top-line camera to have full editing package included. So use/buy 3rd party video editing software.4. Original battery goes down pretty fast, buy spare one (not cheap - $50).5. Default Intelligent Auto (iA) mode sometimes is not intelligent enough, doesn't provide best quality.6. Be careful with wide angle lenses - bent lines, etc. Other cameras make better pics from the same point/distance with the same frame.Overall not bad camera, but price should be about $200 (not 300) because of a small sensor, quality and installed/included software. Disappointed. Overpaid.","November 3, 2009",0
cameras,AVERAGE CAMERA FOR THE PRICE,Sean Jay,R2Y4FNV25IZDDX,3,"My wife and I do a lot day and weekend trips and I really wanted a camera that was portable and compact, yet had decent zooming capabilities. I like to think of myself as an amateur photographer as I have a decent eye for a good photograph. I like to have a powerful but smallish camera at hand if I come across something decent to photograph as I don't like carrying a bulky camera and all the necessary equipment around like a professional photographer all the time. When I came across this camera I thought that it would solve all my problems; I was right and wrong.The camera is very good when there's a lot of light to shoot with. The outdoor photographs are absolutely amazing. The wide angle lens helps capture bigger areas when shooting scenery. The colors are natural and the camera captures all the details perfectly. The HD Movie mode is brilliant. I was very impressed with the clear and crisp picture quality both indoors and outdoors when making HD Movie clips. I also like the fact that there's a separate button to record movie clips. Surprisingly, the camera is not bulky as expected for one with a 12x zoom. Even if it feels a little large at first, you will get comfortable with it as time goes by. I have largish hands so the camera doesn't feel too big for me and it fits in my jeans pocket or a jacket pocket without much discomfort. However, I'm 6""1' and I wear comfortable loose jeans. My wife, on the other hand, is petite and it will NOT fit in her jeans pocket or jacket pocket. Its more of a carry-in-your-bag kind of camera for a smaller person.I am not happy with the cameras zooming capabilities as it is not as powerful as I expected it to be. I expected to get much closer to my subjects with the 12x zoom, but it feels more like a 3x or 5x instead. I was absolutely disappointed with the indoor and night time photos. Every photograph I took turned out blurry or grainy unless the there was absolutely no movement of the camera at the time of shooting. I couldn't figure out the reason for all the noise till I read another review which stated that the camera takes bad indoor and night time photos when its on iA mode. It said that indoor and night time photos should be taken in another mode other than iA. I have yet to try this out. The battery life was a big disappointment too. I could only take about 200 - 250 photo's on a full charge which is nowhere as close the amount of photos I take on a day trip. I ended up ordering a spare battery and a car charger just to be on the safe side.PROS:- Good outdoor photos, brilliant colors.- Superb HD Movie quality.- Wide angle lens captures bigger scenes.- Good sized camera, not too heavy.- iA mode is useful when shooting outdoors.- Easy to use controls.CONS:- Bad photo quality indoors and at night.- 12x zoom is a disappointment.- Poor battery life.- A smaller person may feel that the camera is too bulky.- High priced.CONCLUSION:This camera is neither here nor there; meaning that it does not do the job of being a compact point and shoot camera OR being a camera with good zooming capabilities well enough for the money you spend on it. It's better to go for a cheap point and shoot to take around as your ""just-in-case"" camera and invest in a more expensive camera with better zooming capabilities for outdoor photography.","February 12, 2011",0
cameras,"Good video, average still photos",Lenkov,R21IT8YXOEYVYT,3,"This camera does very good job in creating HDTV videos (you will need VLC player to view them on your PC/Mac), but when it comes to still images -- the quality isn't great. There is a lot of noise and pixalization even when you shoot at very sunny/outdoor conditions, using ISO 80. The auto-focus also it's not great, especially when you use the zoom and the subject is far away.The flashlight is good - you get very realistic colors and it does not burn out the subject if it's close.The image stabilization (while shooting video) is also very good.Also I've noticed a problem with the video when you have fast moving objects or sudden change in the light. It seems the coder does not have enough capacity, as the area where the object is moving fast becomes pixelized.With buying the ZS3 I was hopping to stop caring around always two devices (one still and one video) and for sure I'll replace my Sony HDTV MiniDV camcorder with it, but I'll still have to keep one decent camera for still pictures.I have the camera for already 2-3 weeks.","July 19, 2009",0

cameras,Okay but did not meet expectations,High Expectations,R281PZGU1T3G5C,3,"I was disappointed by this camera. I read a gazillion reviews before purchasing and expected to be impressed. I was hoping that it would take beautiful pictures indoors and of my pets. It did not do either of these things. I had an issue with my previous camera with redeye indoors, and hoped with the technology in this camera that it would correct that. It did not, and I actually had more pictures with red eye than I did before! The pictures indoors were no better than my 3 year old cheapo Kodak EasyShare. The zoom was nice and pictures at a distance did come in clear but it did not zoom as far as I thought a 12x zoom would. There were several little things that bugged me about this camera, one being that I had to move a switch to go from picture mode to review mode. My biggest complaint is the time it took to take a picture. The delay caused me to miss shots. I kept the camera for a few days and played with the different settings, but still was not satisfied. I am sending this camera back.The button to immediately go to video mode was GREAT, and the videos I took were really good quality. If video quality is important than this may be a good choice for you, but since I already have a really nice camcorder it did not factor into my choice of buying this camera. I think this camera took high quality photos, but the advanced features and intelligent auto that I thought would help me to take great photos did not meet my expectations. IMHO I think a cheaper camera would be just as good. The feel of the camera was nice and sturdy as well, and the screen was beautiful.","January 1, 2010",0
cameras,"Good Video capability, but photo is not impressive","H. Wang ""jwangamazon""",R26YP3ODI2NXA,3,"The Panasonic DMC-ZS3 (also called TZ7) is the 5th digital camera I have owned. I have been using Panasonic TZ1 for last 2.5 years and I am quite happy with TZ1 for its optical image stabilization and 10X telecope capability. However, the TZ1 is 5MP with standard Video (SD) only. So, I think it's time to upgrade.Though DMC-ZS3 has 12X power, but I think the practical maximum range is 8X-10X zoom, as the shooting object need to have clear edge for the camera to focus, when in 12X, most of time, the camera will not be able to find an edge for focus. This is a common limitation for most cameras. If the 12X is one of key reason for you to pick this camera, then think again.I was hopping that TZ7 can have better picture-to-picture lag time. But it's still around 2 sec delay time. Kind of slow for taking kid's pictures.The DMC-ZS3 (or TZ7) has an IA mode that automatically adjusts the speed, ISO...,etc for you. In outdoor, well-light conditions, this IA mode is good. However, when shooting indoor, the IA mode tends to pick up ISO above 400. And you will be very very disappointed with the photos taken with ISO >= 400 by this camera, as the photos show very significant noise. My recommendation: stay away from the IA mode for all indoor shootings. Also, the flash light is on the weak side. So, stay closer to your object if you plan to use flash for indoor shooting. Overall, comparing with my old TZ1, I don't see better photo quality taken by DMC-ZS3 (or TZ1), especially for the indoor pictures.DMC-SZ3 has good video capability, you can zoom while taking video (same as TZ1), it also records stereo audio. It supports both standard video (SD) and AVCHD-lite (or 1280x720 HD). Quite some softwares can handle AVCHD editing, like AVS video editor, Corel VideoStudio Pro X2, Cyberlink PowerDVD Director Ultra 8, Nero 9..., etc. Window media player 12 (free) can play AVCHD video clips on you PC also. The AVCHD video clips from the camera can be uploaded into YouTube directly. That makes the video sharing captured by this camera more easier.You should use the IA mode when taking video in any low-light condition, the camera automatically adjusts the ISO sensitive, shutter speed to accomodate the low-light environment. Due to low-light, the video will be somewhat grainy (quite common for consumer level cameras or camcorders), but acceptable (remember, this is a camera, not a camcorder). In outdoor, well light conditons, it produces satisfactory video clips.In video taking mode, the camera will recognize face and try to focus on the face. However, if taking scenery video without clear objects (or edges) for the camera to focus, the video clips do not seem to be sharp.Battery life is on the short side, so, don't forget to charge it before your trip (you won't over-charge the Li-Ion battery).Overall, I like the 1280x720 AVCHD video function and the wide/telo zoom capability, but the photo quality is not very impressive (especially the indoor photos). I will return my DMC-ZS3 and keep my TZ1.","December 28, 2009",0
cameras,Great pictures... proprietary USB connector,Z. Feuerborn,R3CCC1W1Q79YP8,3,"This seems to be a great camera and does take nice pictures for a point and shoot. The previous reviewers seem to of covered most of the ground fairly well, so I won't rehash what they've already stated.This is just a warning for potential buyers out there. The 3 stars I give this camera is because this camera does not use a standard mini-USB cable! If you are tired of carrying around 10 different power/USB cords for you gadgets, do not buy this camera! I am seriously considering returning the camera for this reason (even though both my laptop and netbook have SD card readers... it's the principle of the matter). If you do not mind this flaw, this is a great camera for the money.","January 21, 2010",0
cameras,Coulda' been a great camera,HT Luver,R1IV83AQAI6HSW,3,"The Panasonic Lumix DMC-ZS3 had the promise to be a great Camera.First the bad news:1. A huge downside is that ""Panasonic"" installed firmware in the camera so that only Official Panasonic batteries will work in it. Panasonic's excuse of being concerned about battery ""safety"" is crap! It's all about PROFIT! Battery life is quite short and only one battery comes with the camera. So, those who buy this camera will need to buy an additional battery. Adding insult to injury, Panasonic has such contempt for their customers that they aren't making enough of their own ""Chinese-made Panasonic batteries"" to meet the demand (that they created) and are keeping the price high.2. AVCHDlite is a codec that won't work with any DVD player, HDTV or computer that doesn't already have the AVCHD codec installed. Just by coincidence, newer Panasonic TV's do. Having your HD movies in AVCHD is akin to trying to view a Sony Betamax videotape on a VHS player. All through the instructions, there is the repeated warning that you can't play AVCHD encoded movies on almost anything but Panasonic equipment. Seems that the same VP who came up with the ""Panasonic Only"" battery firmware was in charge of this debacle as well.3. Good luck in getting AVCHD lite HD movies from your camera into your computer. The braintrust at Panasonic once again have cocked-this-up bigtime. I installed ""Photofunstudio"" on my computer, followed the directions precisely and still it refuses to upload newly-filmed AVCHD files from the camera to my computer. All I get is an error code telling me that the video file may be ""corrupt"". What's corrupt is Panasonic's integrity. They immediately need to distribute software to their customers that WORKS WITH AVCHDlite, not like ""Photo-crap-studio"" which can't eve ""see"" existing AVCHD files in the camera. Interesting that Panasonic's engineers can develop a firmware update that ""lockout"" competitors batteries, yet they seem inept when it comes to making software which is actually needed to read AVCHD files recorded to and stored on the camera's SDHC card. Brilliant!4. Selecting the appropriate choice in SCN1, SCN2 or SCN3 is very time-consuming, requiring the user to know all the variables associated with each choice.5. All the warnings about where NOT to use the camera (no dust, moisture, heat, etc.) make it seem like this camera was only designed to be used in an indoor mall.6. Can't shoot photos in RAW.Now the good points:1. Love that 12X optical zoom - but you definitely need a tripod to stabilize the camera at anything over 4X zoom. I picked up a Gorillapod GP1 and it is great.2. On Automatic function, the camera is pretty quick to acquire the subject and keeps it in focus while framing the shot. (this probably accounts for much of the reduced battery life)3. Good feel in the hand, but a little ""rubbery grip"" strip for the thumb on the back would be a good idea.4. The flash is located where it's unlikely to be obstructed by a finger.5. Red eye elimination works well - so far.6. The ZS3 processor does a good job when using the flash where the foreground is lighter than the background. Although it slows down the shutter, in most cases the whole of the image is evenly exposed with no blurring.7. Love the wide angle Leica lens.8. The camera itself is made in Japan","December 17, 2009",0

Overall, I liked the camera because of the features.It takes good quality pcitures without any person in the frame, and I am not satisfied with pictures taken with the subject focus. But pictures are good if you take the scenery or beach or something natural. Also, low light photos taken indoor, are not that good.Video quality is awesome, but it takes a long time to write, given the fact that I used a 8GB SDHC - Class 6 card.I played with almost all the options, for 2 weeks and I returned the camera. I guess, its more of a personal choice when it comes to picture quality. And I am really not satisfied with it.","June 25, 2010",0
cameras,"Camera good, software bad","phasmid ""carausius morosus""",R379QLV5UXM6HD,3,"This camera is good -- it takes fine pictures and is simple to use. The zoom really is nice. My main gripe with it is the software (PhotoFun). I find it very difficult to use. It acquires multiple versions of pictures that have been rotated outside the program, and for some reason multiple versions of each video (i.e. it re-downloads the video every time I aquire new pictures). In general, I just can't figure this software out. I was really hoping to replace Canon's ZoomBrowser (which I was using before with a Canon camera) software with something better (or at least without random, long delays as it categorizes the entire hard drive), but the PhotoFun seems much worse in spite of being a couple years newer. Perhaps there is just a learning curve -- but I really don't think using software like this should require extensive study of the manual -- things like acquiring just the newest images should just work. And it doesn't.","December 13, 2009",0

cameras,not as great as I expected,"S. BO ""sy oy""",R35442JCZVWCSX,3,"I bought my Panasonic Lumix FX9 in 2005 and I've been using it a lot. I'd say that FX9 is such a finely designed model and I really love it. This is also the reason why I decided to get another Panasonic Lumix camera when I was considering buying a new one with higher resolution. However, I'm a little bit disappointed this time about Lumix DMC-ZS3.Pros: 1. very good picture quality 2.longer battery life than my old model 3. much lighterCons:1. The mode adjust dial is very very very loose and when you move your camera around the dial will change position by itself. As a result, the camera always shows the error message ""the mode dial is not in the proper position"" and you have to turn the dial back. This problem is very annoying and I'm not sure if it's just my camera which has this problem or it happens to everyone.2. You have to toss the ""take picture/display"" switch each time when you want to preview the picture you just take. This really sucks compared to my FX9 for which you just need to press the Page down key for a quick pic preview3. Seems like there's no energy saving/sleep mode for this camera. So the lens is always in the pop-up position when the camera is on and you can't put it back to your pocket easily with the popping up lens.

The 12X Zoom feature seems a little odd though, as I have other 12X zoom cameras and this one does not seem to have the same level of zoom ability. It could be some trick I haven't learned yet.My biggest gripe about this camera is two fold. First of all Panasonic has rigged the software on these cameras so you cannot use other brand batteries, you are forced to buy their overpriced batteries. Second, the battery life of the Panasonic Batteries is absolutely horrible. If you plan on carrying this camera around for more than an hour and snapping photos as you go, you will have to have a backup battery.

cameras,STOP! Do NOT buy this camera before you read this!,HiDef Cineza,R1FLLIG7XS3W62,3,"In my journey to find a good P&S; camera that also includes HD Quality video I have made two purchases. The first purchase was the Canon 960is. Please go check out my review on that camera if you are inclined.NOTE: This review will evolve over time as I use the camera.Before I get to any of the details I must inform any potential buyer of a problem that is absolutely infuriating and insulting. That being the fact that the ZS3's firmware version of 1.2 forces you to utilize the OEM battery. Why is this so infuriating you might ask? Well because you can't purchase this battery anywhere. I have gone to all of the vendor's listed on the Panasonic website and they are all out of stock with no estimate of when stock will return.Not letting this stop me I decided to call Panasonic, even though they indicate that you can not purchase the battery directly. Surprisingly this is a lie. The customer service representative has a battery for the camera, at a low low cost of $44.XX with a minimum $8.XX shipping charge. So at ~16% of the cost of the entire camera new, I can purchase 1 more battery for the camera. So be prepared to take your $300 purchase and jack it up to $400+ just so you can take the camera with you on a trip with sufficient backup batteries.Needless to say, Panasonic is starting on the wrong foot by imposing a firmware change that makes no sense at all.STRIKE 1.On to my initial impressions after 5 days of use.The camera itself has sturdy construction that I can't really find any problems with. The weakest point would seem to be the battery/memory card cover. It has a locking device that I do worry about long term. One thing I find really nice is the placement of the flash in the middle of the unit itself rather than the the outside edge like my previous cameras. I found myself covering the flash on my other cameras all the time.The screen quality is very nice; however, I do find that the display when you have the camera on lags badly during realtime display. This is not the case while playback of video however.Pictures so far have been clear and I have not spent much time conducting tests in varied conditions. The dedicated video button is nice and I am off an running taking pictures and movies without much setup at all. Thus far, it's all very easy to understand.more to come later....","September 21, 2009",0
cameras,Lumix CMMMC-ZS3,LKP,R32T1GKXQRFAIP,3,The camera doesn't shoot fast enough for my liking. It lagged and that's one of the most important features of a camera for my use. It seems as the point and shoot camera's megapixel size increases the shutter lag increase too. I use a Canon point and shoot. I didn't like the function buttons compared to a Canon. The lens was great. The file recognition is proprietary so downloading images from the media card into iphoto will not work using a usb cord. You will need to install their software to off load images easier. The camera body and look is sexy. I wanted this camera for quite sometime but after testing it I wouldn't want to own it.

cameras,"Problems with ""Lens Error""",J. Axon,R11W9M4SXJ22RN,3,"I wish I didn't have to write a negative review about this camera. As a die-hard Canon fan with 3 EOS digital SLRs and numerous L lenses in his case, I was initially confident that the D10 would be a significant step-up from my prior underwater system comprising a rock-solid Powershot S45 and Canon underwater-case. I was looking for a less bulky alternative, and the D10 appeared to suit the bill.I love the ease-of-use camera software that Canon has left alone in its various iterations of Powershot series, and the online reviews of this D10 put it at the top-of-the-pack in numerous tests versus other current manufacturer competitors.I've had the camera for just two months, and up until recently it's given pretty good pictures. Even underwater, when using the underwater white-balance setting, and with a little post-processing, the pictures turn out good. The flash throws pretty well underwater, and I've seen no sign of water entry - the seals seem to be well designed. The resolution should give some decent sized prints - I typically print out 17""x22"" prints at home from my SLRs.Ok, so last week when reviewing some pictures, the camera suddenly fails to start-up, with a warning on the LCD screen saying ""Lens Error - restart camera""; a couple of beeps and flashes from the green LED and off it turns. I check it with several freshly-charged batteries and no luck. I put in a new SD card, as if that'll help, but no difference. The problem is with the camera.I've now searched online for this error message, and it appears I'm not alone with this problem. Several people are thinking it's a design flaw with the D10.And ironically, last night, the camera suddenly started working again. But then today it's stopped again. So now I've got something worse than a faulty camera - I've got a sporadically faulty camera.As I say, if you do buy this camera, just ensure you keep the receipt and all the packaging - you may have to avail yourself of the limited warranty, as I'm going to have to do, today. I'll keep my fingers crossed for you that you have a reliable model and if so, you'll have a super little camera.Update (Nov 10, 2009):Camera is currently with Canon. The service department so far has been very good and courteous. They have agreed that it is a warranty-worthy repair and that it should take 7-10 business days to complete. I'll provide an update upon completion of this.Update (Feb 18, 2010):Canon repaired the D10 in Nov 2009. Waited until now to update. I'm happy to say that I've had no issue with the camera since then. It has performed very well, and no apparent recurrence of the lens error. I'm hoping it'll remain this way, and that my confidence in Canon, albeit briefly dented, is slowly on the mend. Indeed, I'm about to buy the 24-70mm f2.8 L lens! (not for this camera...).Bumped up my rating from 2* to 3*. Would like to give the camera more, but having no RAW facility, or a wide-angle lens, and the lack of zoom when videoing still puts this camera at a disadvantage to others including within Canon's range. Who wouldn't love to zoom in when videoing underwater, or have wide-angle capability?","November 2, 2009",0
cameras,Camera has some issues,~kev~,R1ZLU7OAND70Q9,3,"Canon has done a good job of hyping up this camera. The truth is, it has failed to live up to its expectations.

Which does not work with windows movie maker. So you either have to buy some video conversion software, or buy a new video editor. I called canon tech support and they said some software was included with the camera that can convert or edit the video. The problem is, the software crashes all the time. The software is so unstable its not usable - I am running windows XP service pack 2. I had to buy an after market program to convert the .MOV videos to .AVI so they can be edited in windows movie maker.The very least canon could have done, is to test the software before they shipped it. As soon as the included program starts to edit or convert the .MOV video, the program locks up or crashes.At 12 megapixel the pictures have a lot of noise in them. Its like they are grainy for some reason. The 12 megapixel pictures were bad enough that I set the camera to 8 megapixel - and those look better then the 12 megapixel.The pictures are too bright - the automatic setting is nice, but the pictures come out too bight and do not look natural. In low light - instead of the camera switching to the flash, it adjust the brightness and makes the picture look strange.The metal snap of the wrist band causes a lot of noise in the video. While you are filming a video, and moving around, the mic picks up the ""tap, tap, tap"" of the wrist band snap moving around.No second hole in the base for a tri-pod. Which is not a big deal.No cover for the lens. So when you take this camera to the beach, you better be careful around sand. If you get sand on the lens and whip it off, there is a chance you will scratch the lens.Uses lithium battery instead of AA. For an outdoor camera, AA batteries would have been a better option then a lithium battery.Pros:Its water proof, it takes pictures, and films video.Once the .MOV videos are converted to .AVI, they look really good.","October 6, 2009",0
cameras,Solid Canon - With One Fatal Flaw,JW,R2CVMXV8X07LS4,3,"Have owned for 3 months. Solid Canon with usual benefits - easy to use,fast and 'smart' - facial recognition and auto scene selection really do work.12 M chip allows for lots of digital zooming but often is soft at max - likely due to limits of lens in compact camera and aperature speed of shot. Not a problem however if you stay (as you should) within optical zoom range.My previous Powershot was the IXUS 430 (4MB) which had a tremendous dynamic range and auto color balance management - especially in overcast. This D10 with its 12M chip has a very narrow dynamic range and now goes grey in tone with outdoor overcast shots - perhaps an artifact of 12MB in such a small chip. Anyway, even if these two characteristics are not as good as in the past - they are a complaint I find in all my other compact digital cameras. White balance can be managed by using the custom feature and the dynamic range - well, just pretend you are shooting slide film.The biggest (and perhaps crucial) fault is I have found that the camera occassionally exhibits an error; ""Lens Error - Restart Camera"" when starting up the camera. Esentially the lens does not extend and you must take out and re-insert the battery in order to start camera - not a good thing on the beach or while snorkeling. Do a websearch and this error can be confirmed as a problem Canon has had in past. Perhaps Canon's claim of ""Shockproof"" is a marketing gimic and not supported by any new technology - rather the camera is the same as other Powershots - simply put inside a heavy body.If you are a 'Canon Guy' then go ahead and get it - could be mine is a lemon. If you are about to go on a rafting trip on the Zambeizi River, perhaps you might consider another brand - (after doing your web blog due diligence). After all it'd be a bit of a bummer to lose the shot of your guide being eaten by the aligator if the camera choses that moment to freeze up . . .","August 8, 2009",0
cameras,Review for canyoneers - specifically in/out of water situations,H. Pettingill,R9NUJIGAJ58DN,3,"My husband and I bought this camera just before a recent canyoneering trip to Monterrey, Mexico. Our Olympus failed on the last trip (to be fair - it took quite a beating), so we thought we would get something with better photo/video quality that could still handle the harsh environment. We were concerned about the size and shape of this camera, as it really is too big to slip into your shirt pocket (or any other pocket for that matter), but thought that the markedly better photo/video quality would make up for the bulkiness in lugging it around. Plus, we have had very good experiences with Canon customer service in the past, and not so much with Olympus, so we thought we'd give the Canon waterproof camera a chance. HUGE mistake!The main problem that we have with this camera, is that the lens does NOT shed water. It's not a problem if you have any possible way of drying the lens, but as an avid canyoneer - once you get into that wetsuit for a wet canyon, every dry item you have is stored in the dry bag or keg and not easily accessible until you're out of the canyon. We tried everything we could possibly think of to get the water off the lens - *dipping the camera in the water again and shaking it (works with most other waterproof cameras) - no go here *someone suggested wiping with a bandana (supposedly helps even when wet) - didn't work *wiping with fingers with and without neoprene gloves - it just spread the water around *Q-tips in a ziplock in the camera case - ziplock wasn't strong enough to keep out the water, plus it's extremely inconvenient anyway *licking the lens (laugh if you want, but we were desperate!) - helps a little, but in the end I decided the risk in unfamiliar water wasn't worth itSo, at the end of the spectacular water canyon (Matacanes) we have dreamed about going to for well over a year, at least 30-40% of our pictures were so blurred by the water spots, they weren't even worth keeping. Most of the others had blurry spots in them, but they were at least decent enough to preserve the memory. I got to where I mostly shot video, as at least I didn't have to worry about the camera getting confused as to what it should focus on (I'm assuming that was part of the problem with the still shots and all of the water, but I don't know a lot about photography, I just enjoy it). The videos are still fairly blurry, but they are better than not having anything.So, all in all, this camera takes great photos/videos COMPLETELY OUT OF THE WATER, or COMPLETELY SUBMERGED IN THE WATER. If you just want a waterproof camera because you are worried about splashing on it at the beach or pool, or the kids spilling koolaid on it (and you will always have a way to dry off the lens for pictures outside of the water) - then this camera would probably be a good fit for you. I would also imagine it would be good for snorkeling or scuba diving. However, if you are consistently in and out of the water and picture quality is important to you both in and out of the water - DO NOT BUY THIS CAMERA!!! You will be sorely disappointed!! We will be sending ours back.A few more things... some positives... I did like the way the camera has 4 points of attaching the hand loop. That can come in handy. I also like the idea of the accessory pack - the chest harness (we just thought it was extremely overpriced so we decided against it). The camera did seem very durable and handled temperature change well without condensation underneath the lens (I was told this had to do with temp change, but maybe humidity as well?). The battery/memory card compartment was a bit of a challenge to open as it had a very good, tight seal on it - this is a good thing.Also fyi - the battery does not have an impressive life. Ours died about 2/3 of the way through the canyon, after a full charge. Our friends with Olympus and Pentax cameras lasted well beyond ours.Thanks and good luck!!","April 20, 2010",0
cameras,"It's an OK camera, but poor on land picture quality",Megan Nolton,R20O52X7FXEJDM,3,"I got this camera about a year and a half ago for a trip my husband and I took to South Africa, because we were doing the shark cage diving thing and I wanted to take underwater pics. It worked OK for that purpose, but not great. The buttons were fairly easy to push with a wetsuit on, but it was very slow to take the picture in the water, so the only decent shots I got with it were luck since I just had to push the shutter as many times as I could and hope one actually caught the shark. Of course, when there's a 14ft great white 5 inches from your face, working a camera is not the top priority, so that could be partially to blame. On land, the picture quality is worse. Landscapes sort of fade away into the distance- anything far away will often be lost. There are almost no manual controls. And the size is also an issue- I thought the little blue camera was cute, but its bubble like shape makes it really hard to put in a pocket or a small purse, so it did not replace my old Canon Elph point and shoot (I usually use a Nikon D90 on land, but there are those times when you just can't or don't want to bring a giant dslr). My friend got one of the Olympus rugged waterproof cameras, and hers takes way better pictures on land and under water. We took pics of the same things using the same settings, and hers just came out a lot clearer, brighter and better. Plus, the size and shape fits in a pocket a lot better. If you need one of these type cameras, go with an Olympus instead.","August 11, 2010",0
cameras,Problem with Glare off Water,J. J. Clark,R2HQW08AX16GNC,3,"I recently purchased this camera for use on and in the water in Baja Mexico. I liked everything about this camera EXCEPT that many shots were rendered useless due to glare off the water surface. If you have any reflected sunlight off the water, this creates vertical ""bars"" across the image (both on the monitor and on the photo file). The camera manual hints at this problem (with no solution) but doesn't reveal what a repeated and frustrating issue this is, especially for a camera designed to be used on the water! I believe a polarizing filter would fix the problem, but that's not an option for this camera. I hope that Canon (a great company in general) will address this and hope this info is helpful in your purchasing decision.","October 21, 2009",0
cameras,Good Outdoors...beware indoors in some lighting situations,Robert Stone,RKN482L9O55X2,3,"I have a number of canon cameras [SD 550, SD 750, original Digital Rebel (300D), Rebel XSI] and purchased the D10 to take on vacations to beach, water parks etc. I received the camera in early November 2009 and pictures taken outdoors look great. The IS works well and I took a number of good pictures of our new puppy and my young kids (all of which have a tendency to move...darn it!) and pictures look good. Based on reviews here the camera went into the water in the sink almost right away to test the seals as others (from the number of postings this is rare) have had leaks that bricked their cameras. I had no problems there.What I did / do have a problem with is that with some types of fluorescent lighting (that in my kitchen, as it turns out) the pictures have an extremely yellow cast. Selecting white balance for fluorescent lighting did help some but problem seemed to return after several shots even still in that mode. Selecting over to that mode was also quite cumbersome and not something I wanted to do every time I happened to take a picture in my kitchen (which is where our puppy spends quite a bit of time, of course). Oddly, my older cameras noted above all deal with this lighting with automatic settings without problems.The issue was so severe that I actually returned the first camera I got in case it was an issue just with that unit. As it turns out, it appears to be design related. Oh well, I'll simply be sure to use a different camera in the kitchen - but if you intend to use this as not only an occasional camera but your primary camera you may wish to think twice or at least very carefully test it in all lighting conditions in and around your home. Incidentally, this was my first return to Amazon and true to their reputation it could not have been easier. I will keep the replacement camera as it should work well for outdoors / beach / water parks etc. I had hoped to use it as a extra fairly small camera for indoor shots but I no longer plan to use it that way.As a side note, if you get this be sure to re-assign the ""printer"" button to switch to movie mode if you use it for video - the instructions for doing this are buried in the book but this is MUCH easier than selecting mode button, clicking right twice and hitting set.","December 12, 2009",0
cameras,lens error message already,Michael Hanslits,R2MCCRL9P0RGCF,3,"I purchased this PowerShot D10 along with an Olympus float strap to replace a 780 that got dropped in the John Day River on a raft trip, and like my prior experience with Canon products, I've been pleased with the image quality and ease of use. The camera immediately took a trip to Maui on snorkeling trips with a family member and got a lot of underwater use with no problem and some good photos. But all of a sudden, I'm getting the lens error turn off camera to reset message though. Had it on the boat while crabbing on the coast last weekend with no apparent jarring or other incident and it started malfunctioning. It started working for a few days after I tapped the housing a little but problem is back again. Tapped the housing a little and it started working again. Jury is still out at this point. Disappointing as the Canon cameras are really good, and I thought this one would be bomb proof. First of the 3 Canon cameras I've purchased to develop this problem although I've read about the issue. If I end up needing to return it for repair or replacement and they handle the problem well, it would still be a 4- 4.5 star product.MichaelSalem, OR","September 12, 2009",0
cameras,Great camera... but its showing its age.,Elsa G,R2N84HEEXSZRMJ,3,"I was very excited to purchase this camera in anticipation for my vacation to Hawaii this coming September. So when I headed to Lake Chelan this past weekend I thought I would give it a little test run. So in a nutshell I really like just about everything about the camera, familiar and easy to use Cannon design, the waterproofing worked great, and the image quality was good. BUT the biggest kicker was how long you had to wait between photos, usually 5-6 seconds between each shot. The only photos I have are of either the people jumping off the boat... or when they have already hit the water. The wait period between each photo is just way to long and a sign of its age. First you have to wait for the autofocus and take the picture, then you get the busy signal on the bottom of the display, after that you see the photo you just took... and then the screen clears and your able to shoot your next photo. I made the decision that this would most likely big a big issue when snorkeling in Hawaii with fish so I decided to return it. I am going to be spending more money to get an updated camera without the big pause between photos. I sure hope this helps!","July 11, 2012",0
cameras,"Lots of lemonade, but many lemons too",Honest John,R1CBRJV769GI7U,3,"Looking over the reviews, clearly the D10 is an excellent camera for many buyers. But for others -- like me thus far -- it's a lemon. I bought D10 #1 a year ago, primarily for UW photos while snorkeling on the surface during Hawaiian vacations. #1 flooded during our third snorkeling session. I was shocked!! I have used a Minolta Weathermatic film UW camera during many snorkeling sessions over ten years with no problems. And the D10, with just two tiny doors for me to worry about -- battery port and A/V port -- has much less extensive seals than the Minolta. I am VERY CAREFUL to ensure that doors are properly closed. Canon customer service responded well as always and quickly sent me a new D10. Unfortunately by the time it arrived our 2011 vacation was about over. I used it a few times for non-UW shots before our 2012 vacation, and it started to display the dreaded ""lens error -- restart"" message. Initially I could restart it, but when we got to Hawaii this year it refused to restart. Thus for the second year in a row, I spent some vacation time shipping the D10 back to Canon. Once again Canon promptly responded by replacing the optical assembly and returning the camera. That solved the ""lens error"" problem, but on our first snorkel session with the repaired camera, it shut down after 20 minutes. A careful check later at our vacation unit showed that there was moisture inside the screen!! I tried unsuccessfully to get it to work by drying it out. Once again I devoted vacation time to shipping the D10 back to Canon. They replaced it with a refurbished D10 this time. Since our vacation was about over, I had Canon ship it to our home. The D10 seems to work ok based on a couple of non-UW test shots, and I expect that I will once again try it when we snorkel on our next vacation. But needless to say, it's hard to be confident that it will not flood.","June 22, 2012",0

I felt very lucky because the camera made it through my whole trip to Cozumel without a glitch. Once I came home though, that message started to pop up. At first I could charge a battery completely and replace the one inside the camera and the problem would resolve.As of today, the Lens Error message came on and changing the battery did nothing.

cameras,I really loved this... until water ruined it!,Skai,R3RDGVKG87LAL1,3,"I'm so sad... as I really loved this camera. That was before the battery compartment somehow came open and sea water got in and ruined it completely.I bought this camera in August 2009 and took it with me on diving and snorkeling trips to Bonaire, Hawaii, and Thailand. The camera features were great and it was extremely easy to use. I also loved taking videos of my underwater adventures. All in all, I would have been the first to give this a 5 star rating.However, one day of snorkeling I had the camera out and realized it didn't work. I popped up above the waves and saw the battery compartment open, my battery gone, and water in both the LCD screen and lens. Aaaargh!!! I had to buy those crappy disposable waterproof cameras for the rest of my trip, which resulted in with almost-worthless photos.I counted all the times I went into the water and realized the door seal had failed on the 14th day of use. That's just not cool. I'm trying to get a refund via my Visa, as Canon says ""water damage is not under warranty"" and Amazon doesn't take returns after 30 days.I'd really suggest you get a waterproof case and just use a cheap digital camera instead.-----UPDATED 10/18/10I'm bumping this from a 2-star to a 3-star, as I was able to get the camera replaced by Canon (so yay for customer service).HOWEVER, please note that this brand new camera got its microphone damaged after a 2 week scuba diving trip to Fiji and Australia. There's now NO audio for my videos. As almost all of my videos are underwater where audio is unnecessary, I guess that's okay. But sheesh!At least this new one is waterproof (so far), as I am uber cautious about checking the seals EVERY time I get near water.I haven't found anything better, so ""meh.""","February 21, 2010",0

cameras,"Nice camera, until it leaks (again)",Super Dave,RZFJGHQSTQRDO,3,"We have been through THREE of these cameras now- all have leaked eventually. The first time may have been our fault- after seeing a fellow Scuba diver with the same camera at 100 feet (and still working!), we took it to 60 feet on a few dives- and the camera did just fine. We were stoked! Then a few months later it took on water. We sent it back to Canon and they replaced it.While waiting for the replacement, we bought another one (so once the new one arrived we had two of the D10 cameras). Both just abruptly quit working eventually. One definitely took on water, despite never having it more than 5-10 feet below the surface. The second didn't seem to have water inside it anywhere upon inspection- but it stopped working while in a pool. We obviously pushed the camera's limits- use it in the water regularly- with our son, or surfing pictures, and our son will pick it up and drop it. But the last two cameras that died never were taken out of the ""limits"" of the camera's advertised capabilities (water depth or drop height).While the pictures and videos are pretty good- and we have been happy with the camera prior to it breaking each time, I think it is time we ""moved on"" to a different waterproof/shockproof camera.","June 13, 2012",0
cameras,Camera turns itself off constantly,"KayMarco ""boston book lover""",R1PDK3506T9R5T,3,"I bought one of these cameras about 10 months ago. When I have been able to take pictures with it I have had good quality results. However, less than 6 months after I bought it the battery - although fully charged (and I even have two so it probably isn't a battery issue) - keeps turning off the camera. Other times I will think it is off as I cannot see anything through the viewfinder but later I realize that it was taking pictures anyway. This was a lot of money given that I only got one full vacation with it operating properly and on the second it began to malfunction. I followed all directions for taking care of the camera so I believe that it's a fault with the camera but that's little consolation when a warranty is very brief. If you can get one with some kind of extended protection plan I would suggest considering that.

Canon thinks they are making it tough by removing the edges but all they are doing is making it so you cant set is down on a flat surface to take a time delay picture. Also they allow you to attach the dangly thing on any edge. why would you ever attach it to the bottom? well i guess you can't sit it upright anyway. Also its not waterproof. water resistant ok but niot waterproof. first time i took it to the ocean it autoshut off and i had to dry it out. second time the lense filled with water. the only redeeming quality was that it did take good pictures for what it was.

cameras,No way to force the flash,"S. Peterson ""Photo Pete""",R3T82AR21MWHUK,3,"This camera does a good job on land, on sea, and under sea. The pics are quite sharp. Until you get into a difficult lighting situation where the camera can't decide whether or not to use the flash. Then at least half of the time when it should use the flash it does not. In this case the pictures come out very noisy. There needs to be a way to set the flash to fire when you want it to. There is no setting for that, there is only auto or off. So if you find that you take a lot of pictures indoors or around dusk, then you might want to consider another camera. Also there is quite a long lag for focusing. This is not a camera to use for a spur of the moment shot. I am happy with the way it performs under water and in wet conditions though. I bought this mainly for that and it does a good job there.

cameras,"Decent camera, but not waterproof",M. Allen,R3K5EE94YG5FDH,3,"I was thrilled to get this camera recently, but like others found it wasn't waterproof. It takes good pictures, is rugged, but the display died within a minute of it's first submersion into water (and yes, I checked the gaskets carefully before going in). I pulled it out right away, and then spent the next week drying it by opening it up and leaving it in the refrigerator. I got lucky, and it now functions again, but I almost lost my brand new camera. So, now I have to treat it as a water resistant camera... which means it's quite overpriced. Bummer! ~Micah","April 2, 2011",0
cameras,"LCD DIED, NOT REALLY WATERPROOF!! Bring a back up!",Joe Jr.,R20JOX696BWZWL,3,"I bought this camera mainly for our yearly vacation. I tested it a few times before we left for our vacation, mainly in the sink and in the rain. It worked fine every time I used it, but the first time I took it to the beach and went swimming with it, the LCD went out. So I couldn't see what I was shooting, or if it was working. The next day after the camera was dry, the LCD went back on and the photos and videos that I took after the LCD died were there. I thought maybe it was just a glitch. That day we took it to our hotel pool and LCD died again, but the camera still worked. Also the inside of the LCD became foggy and moist. It's been about a month now since we've been back and the LCD still doesn't work, but it still takes pics and video, you just can't see them at the time they're taken. As far as this camera being waterproof up to 33 feet, it wasn't waterproof at 3 feet.PICTURES: The pics come out fine, not the best I've seen, a little soft around the edges but still pretty good. Nice functions, and the auto scene select is a nice touch and works good. The underwater pics came out better then the non-under water pics, although using the flash somethimes makes it too bright and I couldn't make out the fish in the pics. I took some photos of some coral and it came out nice and colorful (without the flash). When using this camera indoors, the flash is way too bright and tends to over-expose.VIDEO: When taking Videos underwater there is a constant clicking noise. Other then that, the videos came out nice and clear and are fun to watch. It does get pretty fuzzy and grainy when using the zoom though.OVERALL: The camera still takes photos and video, but I can't see what I'm shooting and that's a real pain. I do not recommend this camera; I feel ripped off after paying $300.00 for it. I really expected it to work as advertised, especialy being a Canon camera. If you are buying this, and are taking it on vacation, bring a backup. You don't want to miss out on the memories.","March 23, 2011",0
cameras,"Wanted to buy, but this camera is not good enough",Bob Van Epps,RAM8V7MW4PI2Q,3,"I waited patiently for the Canon D10 to arrive. Canon makes great cameras and something on par with their best point and shoots that is waterproof sounds wonderful. The problem is that Canon dumbed down this camera so much that is is not much of a camera at all. I am sure that it will take great snapshots but for $300+, I expected much more.The zoom range is not very useful, there are no manual control options and leaving out HD video... what were they thinking. I am sure that the powers that be at Canon decided that the best plan was to make their first waterproof camera basically idiot-proof and then follow it up with hardened versions of their more avanced cameras down the road. Well, they succeded with the idiot-proof goal. The problem is that the price that this camera commands is way to high, based on its capabilities.I wanted a waterproof camera to take with me on my kayak while fishing in the kelp beds off of San Diego. I release most of my fish so the photo I take is often the only thing that proves I was on the water and not at the bar. After finally getting my hands on the D10, I opted to pick up a very reasonably priced Panasonic ZS1, (not waterproof), at Costco for about $100 less.The ZS1 is a much better camera for the money. While I would have preferred a waterproof camera, for the time being, I will just have to resort to keeping the Panasonic in a plastic bag while out fishing.I am a big Canon fan and am certain that one of these days they will release a waterproof camera that befits the Canon name. The D10 is just not a very good effort.","June 23, 2009",0

cameras,Go buy yourself a Panasonic LUMIX instead..... or try SD940 IS?,B-Rad,R3P0UBEM08PA1W,3,"On the heels of another reviewer, I just spent an hour going through years of archived photos having used the following cameras.And to keep it short and sweet, I was shocked that the $137 Panasonic Lumix outperformed every camera EXCEPT for the HD Video of the new Canon SD780IS. However, the Panasonic family allows WVGA which takes up a LOT less disc space and perfect for Mac/PC viewing.Canon SD200 = My first Elph camera worked perfectly in all conditions for over 3 years; ahead of its time. Under 1MB photos stored, but red eye reduction never worked.Canon SD500 = Bought as upgrade with slightly noticeable difference for still & video, always kept photos in about 1MB size, worked like a charm before 2008 but red eye reduction never worked either.Canon SD1100IS = the BEST Canon I have owned, but stolen last year. indoor, outdoor and video on AUTO were great! no complaints. Looking back, this camera outperformed the photo quality (all conditions) of the 12MP new SD780IS. I hear the 880IS is the ultimate compact model, though discontinued and NO HD. A Canon rep said its been their best model to date for consistent quality and wide angle lens. They sell refurbs at Canon w/ warranty.Panasonic DMC-FS7 = THE BEST BANG FOR THE BUCK PERIOD. the still photos and WVGA videos are amazing and AUTO setting for Panasonic is much more effective than Canon's technology. I was told the Leica lenses are far superior to Canon lens technology as well. This was also stolen overseas, so I bought the pricer FX48 below.Panasonic DMC-FX48 = The still photos were NO different than the lesser priced FS7 and I tested all light conditions, speed etc. However, oddly, the HD video was terrible as compared to the Canon HD. It was very grainy and the motion sensor didn't work well.Canon SD780IS = WHAT A DISAPPOINTMENT! I am overseas now again after tossing the box and papers, and now stuck with this this lousy camera. The HD video is amazing, but the SmartAUTO focus never seems to work for indoor stills, the PROGRAM mode is a royal pain in the *ss, the flash always seems to be too bright for indoors even after changing settings, and good luck trying to photo moving children - takes 1/2 day to focus and shoot. In summary, I changed settings and ISO and cannot get the same quality photos as the Canon SD1100IS (now 1200IS).12-12 UPDATE: I discovered the ""night time"" setting and WOW..... very close evening quality to the AUTO setting of the pre-2009 SmartAUTO technology.ADVICE = NEVER USE AUTO FOR NIGHTTIME SHOTS - YOU WILL SEE BLURRY, YELLOW RESULTS. Switch into Program mode and use preset setting.,.. tested Kids/Pets mode and also works well indoors at night.I'M GOING TO GRAB A 940IS (WIDE ANGLE) AND TEST SOON. It also has front HD mic so your hand doesn't block top mic like 980 design complaints... AND it doesn't have the annoying pop-up flash for 2-hand takers like me.Hope this simple review helps, folks!","December 5, 2009",0
cameras,Ok camera,Blueflower77,R1QFPQ85KRXLL4,3,"To be honest, I bought this particular model pretty much based on the great reviews here on Amazon. I am not a photographer, but I own a high end DSLR and after that, I guess, maybe my point-and-shoot expectations were a little too high. I used to own a Sony point-and-shoot for many years that I loved, then got a Nikon DSLR, so this is my first time with Canon. And I am disappointed. It is my hope that I learn how to use this little camera better and get better pictures.Good things:1. Good focus - the pictures are rarely blurry.2. Very small and compact, fits into the cell phone compartment of my purse - great portability.3. Image quality for the most part is ok if you shoot under ideal conditions - not too much sunlight, not too dark, no one is moving and you hold the camera very still.4. The video quality is fantastic.Bad things:1. I find that this camera frequently over-exposes images. Whether it's daylight outside, sunlight or dusk, whether I use the flash or not, 80% of the time, at least a few spots on the camera are too bright, too white and the image looks poorly.2. ""Auto mode"" chooses the settings poorly in my opinion. There is a ""Program"" mode that allows you to select more specifically (white balance, color choice, vivid vs neutral, lighting conditions, etc), so I ended up reshooting the same thing in the ""P"" mode and got much better picture. But if you're like my husband (the primary user of this point-and-shoot), he says it's annoying to change settings all the time, so naturally he gravitates toward the ""Auto.""3. The flash is too bright for the zoom range. Meaning, the flash is super bright and there is no point in it being so bright because it bleaches out people's faces and anything you put in the few feet range of the flash. However, if you try to shoot something far away with this flash, the zoom doesn't reach far enough to actually see the far image, so especially in low lighting you hardly see anything at all. Annoying.4. I'm a female and my fingers are pretty small. I work in healthcare, so don't have very long nails. The buttons on this camera blend into the body of the camera very well. They are also tiny buttons, so you really have to make an effort with your nail to push the buttons to get the camera to do something. But my husband (whose fingers are much bigger) finds this feature particularly painful.If given the opportunity again, I wouldn't buy this camera.","June 16, 2010",0
cameras,"Safe bet for canon lovers, but....",Kathryn L. Catanese,R26QGZDSJEONFX,3,"The SD780IS is a great buy if you're looking for a pocket camera to take with you on a whim (just in case you feel the urge to snap a few shots). Its a canon so its easy to use and the pre-set modes are fun. I wasn't floored with the picture quality because the colors were way off in certain situations. I rated it three stars overall because the camera doesn't function as well as I wanted it too in low light situations (inside a club, at night, dance floor, weird lighting).","June 5, 2010",0
cameras,Image Sharpness is an issue,Sum,R1I156JIHR5Z0V,3,"- Image not sharp enough- nice and tiny point and shoot- battery life moderate- really good face recognition feature- Overall Pic quality- moderateThe pictures from this camera are not as sharp as I wanted. But there is only so much you can expect with the optics that are packaged in such small width.One thing good about this camera is that it is inclined on taking pics without the flash, allowing the pics to look natural, but it does come with a drawback of increased shutter time and holding it steady.The face recognition feature is awesome. It almost always succeeds in recognizing the face and focusing on them. It even focuses on faces of statues. It also follows the face if the person is moving.I am satisfied with the size and the price of this camera. Since I was going on longer trips with lots of tourists spots, I bought an additional battery, since the battery would not last long enough for the day; especially with the flash active.","August 11, 2009",0
cameras,Not very rugged,Martin Gomez,RM1Q9IWJPLJGP,3,"It takes good photos and videos, but the real virtue of this camera is its portability. It also has a useful feature that I use all the time: you're only one button away from an exposure compensation control. The image stabilization feature works well and gives you decent low-light capability.The only downside, and the reason I can't recommend it, is that my camera is full of sensor dust after only 6 months of use. Now I'll admit, I don't coddle my cameras. I keep it in my pants pocket or a pocket in my briefcase. That environment proved to be too much for the SD780 to handle. There's no way to clean it, and this is not covered by the warranty, so I can no longer use it.This may sound like nitpicking, but my logic is this: a camera this small has only one reason for being...to always be at hand. If I have to keep it in a case, then a) it won't fit in my pocket, so it's likely to be left behind, and b) it's not ready for quick access, so I will lose shots either to laziness or delay.So, if you're willing to keep it in a case and protect it from dust when not in use, buy it.","April 21, 2010",0

Sadly this is the first product I ever bought from amazon with good reviews but an average product. Plain and simple the flash on my camera broke and the zoom is extremely HORRIBLE. Trust me, with this camera you CANNOT zoom at all if you want high quality pictures. Oddly, the major complaint about this camera was the HD recording and the background video noise it produces. I watched it on YouTube and it was bad-but I still took the risk and bought the camera. My camera did not make this noise thankfully. The compact size of this camera is also nice. I would classify this camera as a ""FACEBOOK CAMERA"". One that you just take with your friends. Don't expect breath taking pictures. It would have gotten five stars is the zoom wasn't so horrible and the flash didn't break.My camera is currently being taken care of by the geek squad at bestbuy. They are shipping and contacting canon for me! Even though I bought it at amazon (I'm still under the 1 yr warranty). I give credit to the geek squad for dealing with canon and all the repair issues. They are awesome.Would I recommend this camera? No.I'm not saying it's a bad product, but I cannot overlook the fact that for about $30 more you can get better options from other brands-such as panasonic.

cameras,Nice camera but be aware of video format,g00n,RYWJRK0NQ1ZRG,3,Nice camera but for people who do a lot of video shooting and have a PC with Windows you should be aware that you may have significant trouble editing. I am guessing that if you have a Mac it will not be a problem. You can not use a simple editing program such as windows movie maker in my experience. There is a very basic movie edit option in the ZoomBrowser EX software that came with the camera but I don't think most people would find that it is satisfactory. The movies are in a quicktime format and in my case a search for expensive editing software became necessary. I wasted time trying many free programs with no success. I also tried numerous methods of movie type conversions with no real success. I finally ending up buying Sony Vegas movie studio HD editing software which was about the cheapest option I could find that would work for editing video I took with this camera.If you are going to use the camera for regular video shooting I would recommend buying a cheap aftermarket backup battery.,"December 21, 2010",0
cameras,Disposable point and shoot,Brian,R3Q6R46BRZYPAB,3,"I don't know what is happening to all of the major brands we knew and trusted....I purchased this camera to replace a 5 yr old 5 mp Olympus 5050 that was broken at my wife's friend's bridal shower- (she left it at the table to go to the restroom and when she came back, she found 3 batteries sitting next to the camera, and 1 on the floor, she tried to put the batteries back in and door would not lock down..noone said anything to her.) Meanwhile, I was actually was looking to get a new camera, right before the incident, for I was getting tired of the bulk and older, slower features. Soon as I saw the 780is, I liked the sleek look and ultra-portability, combined with the 12mp and video capability, and It was a Canon, I was jazzed...but it had a 299.99 price tag, that busted the bubble. I said Canon's crazy, I'll wait until the price goes down when the new model comes out. (for those that don't know, a company's new model after a re-design usually is the same product with 1 or 2 extra features, nothing to trip over yourself for.)I patiently waited finally found one for under 170.00 and ordered it right up. Upon receiving the cam, my first thought was man it is small, I charged it up and started taking test shots against his replacement, the Olympus.Here's where the try before you buy is critical, The pics from the Canon were instantly noticeable being grainy and smaller detail was blown out. I thought it was broken, so I called the company and they sent me a replacement. I did notice something else that did disappoint me, both cameras I received were stamped Made In China...Yes, The Japanese brand and rep is now outsourcing to China...great.Sorry, and no offense, but so far, the quality of China goods I've received is not of the highest standards.The pic quality of this cam proves that and says it all- grainy and blurry for inside shots (retouching required) only the outside shots, both still and video, look awesome, but sound on the video is bad, too.After the initial disappointment faded, and I realized quality control is pretty much dead everywhere, I decided to keep the Canon, just for the quick point and shoot convenience. Not to mention that after 2 month of casual use, the paint on the body is wearing off in spots. If I had purchased it at the original price or anything higher than I paid, it would have gone right back.P/S. I did not retire the Olympus after purchasing the Canon as I intended, for its pic quality is superior. A 5 yr old 5mp cam with a rubber band holding it's batteries in place performs better over brand new 12mp cam, What's that tell you??","July 25, 2010",0

I didn't understand why that camera had doubled in price and saw this toted as a ""newer model"" and figured the SD 850 camera was discontinued. This camera although good does not even come close to the 850. The biggest problems are red eye and blurriness. I rarely had either problem with the 850. The flash is in a tiny sliver at the top front of the camera and the instrutions warn that if you accidentally put your finger on it it could destroy the flash. It makes holding the camera akward.

cameras,Works but has its issues,bsg2004,R1O51420ANU0WE,3,"The box includes the camera (in a protective see-through bag), an ethernet cable, the power adapter, mounting screws, and the installation disc and quick starting guide pamphlets. The power adapter plays nice with power strips, it only occupies one position.Installation============I installed it twice for testing and practical purposes. First I installed it with a wireless connection by pressing the button on the camera (blue light blinking on the back) and then adjusting the settings on the router. I don't remember if it was the router button or the router web settings that did it, but it connected, and the light on the back of the camera turned to solid blue.After the installation completes, you are prompted to create a mydlink.com account, so you can remotely monitor the video feed using the mydlink.com website.You can optionally install the desktop software management console from the included disk. On Windows 7 this software wants to completely turn off User Account Control (UAC) and reboot in order to complete the installation. This is an on-going requirement, not just a temporary change for installation. Disabling UAC is not a good idea unless you know what you are doing and why you are doing it.After the initial installation, it wanted to upgrade to the latest firmware. This required a wired (network cable) connection. So I run the installation software again and connected with wired ethernet and the firmware was updated successfully.The default video feed is 320x240 in black and white with audio. If you go in the Advanced Settings, you can change it to 640x480 or 160x120.I only installed this on Windows 7. I did not try any other operating systems.Operation==========The camera heats up within a few minutes. When the camera is facing straight forward (perpendicular to the ground), it can easily tip forward if you hit it from behind, so you may want to make the necessarily adjustments if it is in the way or if there are pets or kids that may bump into it.This seems to work best in smaller rooms with relatively even lightning. Perhaps best suited for apartments or small rooms.The Apps========The free MyDlink app worked successfully on the iPod, Kindle Fire, and Google Play devices (smartphone and tablet). The app basically logs on to your mydlink.com account and picks up the video from there.Mydlink offers a basic app for free (lite app) and a 99c app with presumably more features. Charging for an app for a specialty hardware device that a consumer purchases is a rather cheap thing to do and does not reflect well on the manufacturer of the product. Minus one star for this nickle-diming. By looking at the Google Play stats, under 10,000 people bought the 99c app, so it's not like it is a big money maker they need to protect.","October 13, 2012",0

It was a breeze to set up and the video quality is decedent. There is a slight delay sometimes but it could be my wifi hookup. The sound is terrible though, you can't hear anything but static, so if you are hoping for good sound quality, consider another camera.","August 9, 2012",0
cameras,"Good, but not great...needs some improvements","Z. Johnson ""musician_from_cal""",R2YG1M4SMEDOVB,3,"I've been using this camera for about a month now to keep tabs on my pets. I notice the price has increased almost 10% in just the last month. Honestly I don't think I would've bought it at the new current price level. Anyway here's what I've found with this cam so far:PROS: *Infra-red night vision feature works great..lights up whole room even in total darkness *Very clear, sharp video.CONS: *DLINK forces you to rely on their mydlink.com website in order to view the cam. Often times their site is slowwwwww, disconnects without reason, or just won't connect at all at random times. *Audio is HORRIBLE! Dirty, static-filled sound, sort of like an old vinyl LP that's badly scratched all over the place...it sort of works sometimes, but DLINK clearly didn't give a crap about making the mic and audio sound quality something which reproduces a good clear sound...it truly sucks. *Installation was NOT as easy as they like to lead you to believe it will be. I had to call their tech support for help in order to get it to work. They stepped me through a few configuration changes and now it works fine, but it certainly wasn't the simple plug-and-play installation I thought it would be based on all their literature. *I-phone app is TERRIBLE! Keeps disconnecting after 60 seconds and forces me to reconnect again and again and again...very frustrating & not what I expected for a camera at this price level.BOTTOM LINE: It's good, but not great. It will likely do what you need it to do, but at the current higher price level I would seriously suggest looking at the competition. For that much money the problems I mentioned above shouldn't exist.","July 4, 2012",0
cameras,Firmware update required!,"rteder ""rteder""",R13YT8MRN8WTG0,3,"If you are looking for a camera that ""just works,"" keep looking.The biggest shortcoming of the device is that it will periodically demand of you; ""firmware upgrade required!""

We cannot rule out that I did something wrong, but I am an electrical engineer who develops products with firmware for a living, so I doubt it.So, not every time I log on it nags me: ""Firmware Update Required!"", but I click ""Remind Me Lator"", as I do not want to turn it into a brick.","June 9, 2012",0
cameras,Not so easy to install,D. Casey,R1AZKLU5AYTD7Z,3,"They claim the setup is easy. When trying to connect it to my router, it shut it down and reset my router settings. Once I contacted Cisco regarding my router and got it back up online I tried loading the software that came on the CD with the camera and the software won't even come up properly, I keep getting some 'script error'. You can only email support and their reply was to update the firmware and one of the steps to do that is to type in the IP address of my camera into the web browser with no explanation of what that means or how I find out what the IP address is. I wouldn't bother unless you have a networking degree.If I ever get it up and running, I'll update.UPDATE: Ok, it turned out it was my computer. We think the virus software was causing the software to not load properly. I do have it working now but I also had to update the firmware which the average joe just can't do. And it did turn out they had an 800 number to help but its not easily found. THe bottom line is for some it will be as easy as 1,2,3 to get it working but for others, if your computer, router, etc. is not the latest and greatest you probably will have issues and will have to work on it for several hours.","April 26, 2012",0

In late January the issue was finally escalated to 3rd tier support. After 4 weeks of sending them config files from my cameras and router, they decided the cameras can't work with the FIOS router and recommended I buy the D-Link DIR 655 router, raising concerns of how FOIS will act. While the instructions claim all that is needed is a router that supports UPnP (which the FIOS Router does), there are apparently issues with the way the FIOS ports are dynamically assigned.

This device is pretty nice looking and does not have an antenna sticking out. I use Macs and I had no real trouble getting the Dlink setup using their 'wizard' which essentially lets you view live video through the mydlink.com website. If you are not experienced with network settings thats the ONLY way to go. However, I just wanted to test that approach and then manually configure the cam so I can log in directly from the internet using a little used port (something like 8089). I did get the mailer to send emails though my Gmail account, which some other cams cannot do. Here is the setting that worked for me: SMTP Server Address SMTP.GMAIL.COM SMTP Server Port: 587 Sender and Receiver email address: Your gmail address Your gmail user name and password Select STARTTTLSYou will probably have to open port 587 on your router to the cams internal IP address!

It's wireless N so it should have a very big range, but in fact has a shorter range than my wireless d/g laptop. I was counting on using the sound component to help wake me up when the mare begins foaling as night, but after the first night the audio sn't working anymore -- all I get is a click loop that goes on and on, no matter how many times I close my browser or restart the camera. So it's not serving it's function, other than to save me the trip to the barn very few hours when I wake up to check on the mare. I'm going to have to buy a regular old baby monitor to hear the mare, too... So, three stars. Oh -- and you can't feed the video to your own website, only look at it through Dlink. that is pretty annoying, since I have a ton of friends who would like to see the foaling.

cameras,"Not the Canon ""perfection"" I'm used to",bythecshore,RJT9OFAAV9I9U,3,"I was really psyched to get this camera, as I've had several Canons over the years and know they make great cameras. I'm used to being delighted by them but was a bit underwhelmed with this one.Don't get me wrong, it takes great photos, has great build quality, but there are a couple of glaring problems.First is the flash. Although I've had the camera several months, I still can't get used to the little pop up flash that wants to open under my finger. It's just in the wrong place, period.Second is the GPS, one of the primary reasons I bought this camera. Having used GPS functionality when taking photos with my iPhone, I was excited by the possibilities of geo-tagging all my future photos taken with a ""real"" camera. But I've been disappointed. The GPS takes a long time to acquire a satellite, and indoors almost never does. I'd say about 1/3 - 1/2 of my photos overall are tagged (10% indoors, 60% outdoors). This is particularly disappointing seeing as how my iPhone does it 100% of the time.My last camera was a Canon 1100IS, and the photo quality looks about the same. That was a great little camera.So - on the plus side, this camera takes very good photos, is feature-laden, has an excellent 14x optical zoom, and great low-light capabilities.On the minus side is the very mediocre GPS sensitivity, battery life, and flash placement. For $350 for a point & shoot, it should be closer to the (usual) Canon perfection.","May 21, 2011",0
cameras,Canon has better cameras,Victor Gavrilenko,RJHD073W5EGWN,3,"There are many good things about this camera, but 3.0"" widescreen and redesigned menus make it hard to use.

Widescreen means when you take 4:3 images in 4000x3000 resolution then only part of the screen will be used, resulting in effective 2.4"" visible image. When you take images in 16:9 mode they will fill entire screen, but only part of the image sensor will be used, resulting in 9 megapixel 4000x2248 resolution and about 30-35mm zoom vs 24mm wide angle.

cameras,Canon what's going on? another soft focus camera?,Scott,R2Y09XSJ1T60RX,3,"I wanted to give this one a try after the terrible A3300. I have an old Canon sd950 that takes amazing photos but its a bit out dated and the focusing is slow as well as saving. I had hoped that the 230 would work out after trying the A3300, although, I liked its size, ergonomics and features, it took very soft unsharp photos. This 230 seems to suffer from the same problems. Out of 10 test photos, both flash and non flash of the same subject, half were soft and very grainy. I tested both outdoors and indoors with various subjects, lighting, objects etc and while some portrait photos looked great, everything else just didn't have that sharpness. I utilized the many settings on the camera which was the main reason I wanted to try this one out. It has a full auto mode that was just terrible with exposure and focus. The program mode was good but not up to par. The Shutter and aperture settings were the same.I have a panasonic FH25 and compared photos taken together with the Canon 230 and the panasonic was a clear and I mean clear winner. Although it doesn't have many of the cool features the canon does and the lcd screen wasn't as sharp, the bottom line is that the photos come out crystal clear for less than half the price of the canon. The flash on the panasonic tends to be a little too bright and all of the photos seem to have a slight green hue where as the Canon's exposure when using flash was better as well as the color tones. But, I can correct most of the Panasonic's minor problems in photoshop whereas you can't do much with sharpness with out it looking odd so for that alone the canon has to be returned for soft photos. For now i'll stick with my FH25 until there is something else better out there that really has superior sharpness and low noise/grain.","August 5, 2011",0
cameras,"great camera, except","rsvat ""rsvat""",R1SSZDIGWJ2TUN,3,"I have used the camera for several weeks now and on the whole like it. However, I miss having an optical view finder which would make using it in many situations so much easier. For example, action shots, bright lighting(lots of reflection on the monitor), any time you don't want to have to hold the camera out in front of you, when you would rather not have the monitor on, etc. This is my major complaint and dissatisfaction with the camera. If you have never used an optical viewfinder this may not be a problem. Focusing can be a problem but I think with more usage I will do better with it. The video is great and easy to use. One caveat, don't try viewing it on Picasa. I would also recommend buying a semi-hard case. I initially bought a soft belt case and found that I was losing part of my picture due the lense shield not opening or closing fully. This was due to the ""ring"" around it bending slightly due to pressure on the case. I was able to correct it by bending it back out. Canon support was not much help. Suggested a complete reset, etc and then send it in. Not much diffferent, tho, from most support.The zoom is great and the image stabilization has also been great with the optical zoom. I would never have been able to hold my old SLR steady at that magnification.Overall I would recommend this camera to anyone that wants a small camera with lots of features and great picture quality. Using a belt case I take it everywhere which I didn't do with my SLR.","June 18, 2011",0
cameras,Canon PS SX230 Review,"N. Schumacher ""zenuser""",RF3KGGM0L0G4P,3,"Ordering and delivery from Amazon was, as usual, a perfect experience. However, I am disappointed in this camera.This purchase was meant to be a replacement for my wife's 6 year old Casio point and shoot, and as a pocketable alternative to my Canon SLR when I don't feel like carrying all my SLR ""stuff"". While it is pocketable or purse ready, and has many of the shooting controls that allow control of shutter speed, aperture, white balance, etc. the picture quality is just not up to expectations. Let me be clear, this is not in comparison to my $1000 SLR, but in comparison to the old Casio 6 Meg P&S.;What I like:- zoom range- manual controls- dedicated video recording button- GPS- Creative effects- Video performanceWhat I don't like- Image quality (I've even set ISO to a low setting to try to limit noise)- Poor White Balance consistency, in auto mode- Low battery life, especially with GPS activeI'm a long term Canon fan and user, but somewhat disappointed in this camera.","August 27, 2012",0
cameras,Focusing issues,J. Wells,R2YVLGI6GGXHR3,3,"Although this camera has great specs, I am not impressed with its ability to get focused when zoomed out. I have taken numerous photos of stationary wildlife while zoomed out, but very few of them turned out to be acceptable. Most of them were blurry. I noticed that the camera was having trouble getting focused during the shots, so I tried to time the press of the shutter release to catch it in focus in the viewfinder. That worked about 20% of the time.If the zoom is not used, then the camera takes good, even very good, photos, but it should work in zoom mode, also.I would not have purchased this camera had I known about the focusing issues while zoomed. One of my other cameras is a Lumix. No issues with that one.","May 27, 2012",0

The 14x zoom was one of the biggest selling points for me. But the ease of use for manual operations wasn't very good and not matter what I did in manual operations it seemed to make the shot worse.

After a few hours with it, we realized that the quality of photos was still disappointing. The pictures are slow and still tinted with yellow. If the subject is a still shot and it is extremely well-lit or you are outside, the photos turn out great but not otherwise. We instead chose to return this camera and purchase the Nikon S8100. That being said, it doesn't have all the fancy features that the Canon does but it takes faster pics and better low-light pictures.","December 28, 2011",0
cameras,Poor ergonomics,A. Sridharan,R1WMA458B71AC8,3,"A feature rich camera, good 14x zoom and goes up to 56x with digital zoom. However, zooming in and out is pretty slow. Takes very good quality pictures, HD video recording is good, many manual settings and multiple ISO settings. I don't quite care for the fish eye and other features like color saturations...you could do all that with your picasa or photoshop. Still good to see those features added in. My biggest complaint, and the reason I'm giving this only a 3 star rating is the thoughtless ergonomics. I don't know if the engineers that designed this product even held it up in their hands and tried to operate it with one hand...which is what I mostly do, especially when I'm on the move. The flash is poorly located right were your left index finger would go if you held the camera with two hands. The flash pops out as soon as you turn on the camera...and you can't manually push it down either. The other area of bad ergonomics, and it is not limited to this camera alone, is the lack of a little bump in the front...the area where your right hand goes and wraps around the sides. I personally find it very useful...makes it easy to handle it with one hand, and adds a great amount of stability. I have an old PowerShot SX110IS...and it has great design. I wanted to upgrade to a newer model which fits more easily into my pocket. This one is pretty slick and slides easily into my jeans pocket, but the compromise in handling negates that benefit. Overall, a pretty decent camera. If you don't care for the ergonomics, this is a good buy. I bought it for $199. I will not recommend paying anything more than 200 bucks for this though.","December 3, 2011",0
cameras,Upgrade from Canon SD1100 is to SX230 HS,Robert Lee,R32OMC4AEW4KNV,3,"I'm just an amateur/casual photographer, but a fan of Canon camera.I just got the SX230 HS, and took it around for a quick spin today. It is bigger and heavier than the SD1100. The SD1100 is small enough to carry around in my pocket, even when I am strapped into a rollercoaster; you have been warned.Yes, the flash pops up, when you turn on the camera. More so, once it is up, holding the camera is ""less than ideal"", verging on awkward. However, if you hold down the flash before turning on the camera, the flash will stay down. Unfortunately, you can't re-enable the flash once it is down, as far as I can tell so far.Of course, this is a far different camera from the SD series - captures 4:3 1:1 and even 16:9 aspect ratios, better low light capture. Oh yes, one can only take pictures via the screen; they took away the view finder. And yes, I do use the view finder on those occasions when the glare is extreme.This is Canon's n'th iteration of the PowerShot digital camera. I still do not know why they make the I/O port cover so flimsy.So far, I am thinking the SD1400 may have been a better choice.","July 31, 2011",0
cameras,"Good movies, less than average pictures",aditud,R9C402MH2HDVG,3,"About 7 years ago, around the time my son was born, I bought a Panasonic Mini-DV camcorder. It isn't bad, but turned out to be such a waste of money. Once I got a Canon SX100IS in 2008, I barely needed the camcorder; the compact Canon mega-zoom (10x optical) digital camera is superior even as far as movie capabilities go. I am neither an impassioned photographer nor an inveterate movie shooter, and the 8MP Canon SX100IS has been exceeding my expectations; great pictures in SuperFine mode (comparable, if the light is good, to what I'd seen taken with pro cameras) and crisp 640x480 resolution SD movies.Recently, I decided to move up to HD. Due to my previous experience, I did not even bother checking out HD camcorders once I found out there were compact digital cameras with HD movie mode out there. As my SX100IS still functions perfectly, the HD movie capability was the deciding factor to purchase a new camera. I was elated to find out about the SX230HS, with its 1080p24fps Full HD mode, and its 14x optical zoom (available while filming as well). Wasn't completely happy with the proprietary battery (the sx100 has two AA's), but went ahead with the purchase nonetheless (bought a spare battery, too).The reason I give the camera 3 stars only: even though I am happy with the movie quality (crisp, amazing Full HD for a camera this cheap), this camera doesn't have the SuperFine setting for pictures anymore (apparently, none of Canon's newer models does) and the Fine mode (other being Normal) doesn't cut it! Unless the light is optimal, the pictures in Fine quality are grainy and soft, even though the colours tend to be nice and realistic. So, I am somewhat disappointed. The main reason I gave up on buying camcorders was the possibility of getting a good camera with great movie capability (like the sx100is). The problem with the sx230hs is that it works better as a camcorder than a still camera!","February 12, 2012",0
cameras,A bit underwhelmed,"baslanides ""baslanides""",R19HVCR7IFV35L,3,"I was replacing an older Powershot which I loved but lost. Thought I'd give Canon another go. I was really underwhelmed with the quality of the photos. I don't know if I had a defective unit or not (I have no evidence it was) but there was lots of noise and graininess in the pictures. That is the main reason it is going back. There are others, though. The GPS is absolutely useless and the battery life was problematic. I don't understand including GPS if it takes so long to aquire a link. The flash position on the camera is quite possibly the worst design flaw I have ever witnessed. I really can't believe that they let it go out the door like this.I can't tell you all how disappointed I was. I am a gadget guy, so it's not a technology problem I assure you. Nor am I a photographer with unrealistic expectations. The pictures just weren't really as good as I had come to expect.On the plus side, I will say that this thing is built like a tank (it is a bit on the heavy side) and the 14x optical zoom is absolutely first rate. The videos were very nice as well. I do wish they had included a panorama mode.Unfortunately I am going to have to return it and see what else I find appealing.","August 8, 2011",0
cameras,ok photos; not pocketable,Marc Erickson,R3J9KIXTEZ1R8I,3,"I mostly got this compact size because I wanted to carry it in my front jeans pocket. It is slightly too big for that. I tried it anyway and found the lint problem others have complained about--lint will get under the lens cover and is impossible to get out. The pictures are only okay--lots of barrel distortion; often loses focus when doing video; doesn't do great in low light. I had an S45 previously and would go back if I could, even without great zoom. Generally, the only thing this camera has on my S3 phone camera is that it has better white balance with flash (which the S3 is horrible with). So, all-in-all, it performs okay, but I generally just use my phone now.","March 2, 2014",0
cameras,Canon Powershot SX230,"Middle Class Man ""AL""",R3KPX1DRJLARU,3,"Although this camera was purchased in 2011, it wasn't until recently that I had an opportunity to really use it on a two week Asia vacation.This camera was selected for the many fine features it has within but specifically for the GPS feature to be used on my vacations.The Good:It has exceptional ability to shoot in low light without a flash. The ability to zoom in quite a lot is also very good. Because of all the options in shooting, you can be as manual or as automatic as you wish. Overall the pictures and movies it takes are very good for amateur photography.The Bad: As mentioned earlier, I chose this model specifically for the GPS function. That function is next to worthless. It's not a faulty part as I thought but actually the way it is built into the camera. Unless you are on a mountain top or in a open field, the probability is that it won't even see the three satellites it needs to provide the data. Worse yet, the data is only available in your computer and does not stamp your pictures like date and time. When it does function the information is so vague you may as well not have it unless you are a navigator by profession.The pop up flash is always in the way when you start the camera as this area is normally where your fingers go to hold it properly. Really poor planning on Canon's part.The button to start a short movie is in a really lousy spot to find unless you are looking directly at it and when you shut it off, you must ""bump"" the camera because of the obscure spot in which it was designed.Perhaps some of these features were improved in newer models but I am told the GPS is still just as lousy.I was also using a SONY GPS video camera on this same trip I just returned from. The Sony video camera took in the satellite information instantly whenever I was shooting outdoors and a local camera repair shop told me recently that the video cameras always do a better job at GPS then any still digital model. But the bottom line is that even in the video camera, the GPS information is only for the computer therefore worthless as part of making a slide show or movie and including a map as reference to your photography experience.Bottom Line: DON'T BUY GPS IN A CAMERA. If there is a similar model without GPS your saving money and a better value. Perhaps someday the camera makers will wake up and do something to make it worthwhile and powerful enough to do it quickly and stamp it to the shots you take. Until then, all GPS is, is a broken promise.So it was the lousy GPS that reduced the rating (mostly) on this purchase.Rare for me to write a lousy review on a Canon product as I have other Canons that are wonderful but in this case Canon deserves my ire.","January 27, 2014",0

Filming a quiet scene there seems to be internal feed back of sorts. If you're filming out of doors the microphone is highly sensitive and picks up breezes easily as well as any hand movements touching the camera. That's about the only annoyance, but a big one for us since we like to take videos often.","January 22, 2014",0

If you drop the camera it takes a lot of damage and not rugged at all. GPS usually works but not always, and can take a while of leaving on to track. Recording video will kill the battery in about 15 minutes.Conclusion: I expected more from Canon. This camera is mediocore. If it wasn't for the really strong zoom i'd just use my iphone. Quality and control of iphone 5 and later is about same. Unless you want to go diving with it.","October 13, 2013",0
cameras,"Great for a year and a half and then , nothing",Crazy 4 Books,RRLDRJWDDU6MA,3,"I have had this camera for almost two years. As far as the camera and the quality of the photos , they are amazing, really. However now that the warranty has expired (of course) I have a major problem with the camera. It shut itself off one day when I was going to take a photo. Now I can turn it on, but the viewing screen is dark and I can only see shadows, nothing clear. None of the buttons work, I am unable to review my photos on the camera, change settings or anything else. So basically I have a $200 + camera that it completely useless. Canon says I can send it to them with a minimum $100 repair fee plus parts - or I can buy a refurbished one at a better price. I would rather just buy a new camera if that's the case and I will check other brands. So, it's a wonderful camera when it works, but you had better buy the extended warranty and hope it helps.

The image looks clear on the back of the camera, but then it's a little blurry when I pull it up on my computer. It was suggested that I take it off Auto and try manual settings by one camera person.

Considered DOA, it was returned to Amazon and replaced immediately. The replacement powered on perfectly, but after looking at the pictures from our first trip we noticed strange spots on the images. Looking closely at the lens, we discoved small white specks trapped between the elements of the lens, almost like paint splatter. Being a few days outside the normal return window to Amazon, I wrote and explained the situation. In typical Amazon fashion, they replied immediately and authorized the return. I'm now on camera #3. Looks good -so far-. My disappointment with Canon's quality control is, however, somewhat moderated by the excellent customer support at Amazon. My recommendation - if you buy this camera, make SURE you check it carefully.","February 22, 2012",0

It is located at the top left corner. This is where I would naturally place my fingers to hold the camera. The flash pops up when the camera is turned on so if you have your finger on top of the flash it will not pop up. If that happens many times I'm afraid the flash will stop popping up and I'll have a broken camera. It is also difficult to hold the camera once the flash is up.

I have always been thrilled with the Canon picture quality, but I guess I was just lucky before. This SX230 disappointed me with the blur of the pictures at the higher zooms. Backing off the zoom did result in better picture quality, but why have all the zoom if you can't use it? The low light capabilities were disappointing. And the final straw was the GPS not reading my location. I felt this camera did not deliver the Canon quality I was expecting, and flat out did not have a functional GPS for the camera. Canon, you can do better than this.","November 22, 2011",0
cameras,"Meh, more spec is NOT always more camera",MysticJaguar,R1Y6LR8PQTONB5,3,"Camera design always involves trade-offs. In the case of this camera after a few shots I've noticed this tendency overall:- Camera tends to overexpose generally by about 1/3-1/2 stop.- There is noticable highlight clipping with this camera. It's average to a little worse than Panasonics in the same caliber.- Images tend to look very digital/video-ish rather than as genuine true-color, true-contrast images.- Macro mode is very fussy and has as many misses as hits in both focus and exposure.- The flash wants to pop-up just about every time you turn on the camera. I now keep my finger over the latch when turning it on.- The cameras ability to register hues in the purple/pink part of the spectrum is very limited. You end up getting tones which are much lighter and less saturated than they should be. This would not be a good camera for photographing flowers in that part of the color spectrum.- Auto White balance indoors is pretty good.- Menu system is generally good except when deleting photos, too many clicks. (It's hard for me to recommend Panasonic in particular over this camera because their menus look so ancient, largely unchanged in the past five or more years.)- Major functions of flash/exposure compensation/macro/self timer are NOT marked on the round dial in the back. Canon, what were you thinking?This is an ok camera but not stellar. I would not pay more than $225 new or $170 used for it. If you shop around you can find better cameras at this price point. And from what I can see the sx260 hs would be a definite pass due to quality control issues. It's very common for Canon and other manufacturers to get a design just right (say on the A620) and then fumble in the next couple of versions.Canon is at a crossroads now. They were extremely popular in P&S; up through the mid-2000's. But they pulled the optical viewfinder from the A series (it has just returned in the A1200 which is closer in value to getting what you pay for then this camera), and frankly Canon has too many ELPH models just now. The G series is too bulky now that M4/3 and others like DMC-LX5 are on the scene. The superzoom sx40hs (whose body is just ugly compared to something like the Sony DSC-HX200V) exhibits a fatal attraction to zoom length (35x? you can't believe how much that hurts optical quality). Only in the past couple of years have manufacturers learned that the number of megapixels alone is not the way to get quality people will buy. And we'll see how long it takes for them to realize the same in zoom range. Somewhere from 10x-15x is probably the sweet spot for consumer super zooms. The S95/S100 is just a little too small to both hold and operate.If Canon were to reduce the current number of P&S; cameras from THIRTY to like FIFTEEN, and really focus on building in the quality, and getting the features just right, then they would be a much stronger company. The CEO just resigned and this lack of focus (pun intended) on fewer but better models is symptomatic of what's going on in the company. They have what it takes, very much so, but are not thinking things through. Just cheap is not good. Megazoom kills optical quality. High megapixels (say over 7-9) in 1/2.3 "" sensors does not make sense either.Canon currently has NO really compelling P&S; cameras with a good mix of features and ergonomics IF you want some controls like Tv/Av/Manual and something more than 4x zoom.Now the T3i and T4i is another class of camera again, high recommended, but you have to want to carry around the extra bulk (and go with something like this Tamron AF 17-50mm F/2.8 XR Di-II LD SP Aspherical (IF) Zoom Lens for Canon Digital SLR Cameras instead of the kit lens).But if you get everything else right in a camera and don't have any kind of viewfinder, something you can frame with even in strong sunlight, then you are selling customers short. This camera does not have a viewfinder either which does not help it's overall value.At this price point (and of the current sx260 HS) I would have to say the Sony DSC-HX5V may be a stronger contender during 2012. (I own a Panasonic FZ35 and FX37. I recently sold my sx230 HS after having it for a few days and am looking at a older Canon A620 and A1200 instead. Both with enthusiast controls and an OPTICAL VIEWFINDER.)","June 15, 2012",0

When I got it home, I realized without the security handle I used to hold it in the store, it lost a lot of it's appeal.One of the biggest issues is the pop up flash on the top left corner... right where you hold it when you turn it on. I also found the small dial controls on the back of the camera to be difficult to negotiate and the menu in general, hard to use. The battery/memory card door on the bottom of the camera is very difficult to open. I also wish it had, at least, a small internal memory.I enjoyed the results I got playing around with this camera.

Camera meets those needs.Agree with others that flash is in awkward place. GPS even records altitude which was a pleasant surprise.histogram, grid, OIS, one button movie record were all features I expected and it has.I have had a Lumix ZS 3 (previously my ""travel"" camera, until black spot appeared on all the photos on my last trip), Canon S80 (great sturdy build, still clear pictures but zoom isn't as long) and Canon IS 780.part that I am most disappointed in was the lack of a ""voice memo"" feature. it has been present on earlier Canon point and shoots (e.g. S-80 and ixus 780, it takes movies with audio, so is capable of recording audio, so why not keep that feature? The voice memo feature is useful reviewing pictures at the end of the day, making notes on them, before you forget where you were. The GPS was supposed to help with that but... see below.I would have rather have kept that feature instead of the in camera color ""tricks"" features that have been added.... those ""tricks"" are much easier to do with a computer anyway.other wise appears to be a very nice camera.addendum: after using for 3-4 trips, over 5 months, the GPS is slow and unreliable.

cameras,GPS is a joke,Bojan Niceno,R2CASJFZ6411HB,3,"I love Canon products. I have always loved them. The quality of pictures taken with Canon cameras never let me down. This camera is no exception in that regard. You will be able to get high quality photos inside, outside, in the shadow, the zoom is fine. Mechanically and optically this camera is flawless, like all the other Canons I had pleasure to own.But its GPS feature is a practical joke. You can browse through camera settings to switch the GPS on or off, but that's where all the fun stops. GPS simply doesn't work. It's just an illusion. I gave this product three stars only because it is advertised as GPS. If it was advertised as ""digital camera"", it would deserve 5 stars.-----------------------------Several days have passed since I wrote the above review, in which I was critical about the Canon's SX230 GPS capability. Or, the lack of it. I was wrong then, now I realized it works. That should be good, right? Wrong! GPS' only function is to consume battery, EVEN when the camera is switched OFF! And it does it a fast pace. A couple of hours after switching the camera off, its GPS will empty the battery. This feature would deserve to take one star from the mark I gave in the first review, leaving it at two stars only. But, I must confess that this feature gave me a really good laugh, so I keep the mark at three stars :-)Needless to say, I will never switch the GPS on again. I am even considering scratching the ""GPS"" letters from the camera off, but I am afraid to damage its surface. Placing a sticker over it might do.","January 25, 2012",0
cameras,Canon Powershot sx230,sml,R3NPRD9WH67VCN,3,"I always liked my Canon Elph camera so I thought this would be a good upgrade when I needed a new one. So far I'm not sure. The thing I object to the most is the lack of an operation manual. Canon gives you the manual on a disc but that doesn't help if you are out taking pictures and have a question about how something works. There reasoning is they are going green and you can take the disk to your printers and have one printed. I say they are going cheap, not green. They also don't even give you a small SD card so you can at least take one picture. As far as how the camera operates I can't really say since I haven't been around a computer long enough to read the manual. My pictures seem hazy but maybe it's something I need to change in the settings.","December 30, 2011",0

I tried the map software when I got home, and the GPS logger had logged partial tracks. So I tried to export the logs to google earth so I could match it to the closest location of the images, but the software was buggy giving me errors when trying to export the logs: Can't save the google earth file in a system folder, removable disk, network, or a file with a filename that's too long.

cameras,Slower than T2i!,Dimitri,R1GWBFQZL7IFDZ,3,"I bought the T2i first, then decided to upgrade to the T3i. For a period of two weeks, I had both cameras in my possession, so I could make a direct comparison, and decided hands-down that the T2i is the one I will keep. Why? The T2i is FAST. I shoot my toddler in continuous mode, and the camera delivers the 3.7 fps it's supposed to. It makes a huge difference knowing you can press the shutter and the camera will instantly take a picture. The T3i, however, adds frequent and unpredictable delays when ""busy"" flashes in the viewfinder and the red light is on -- even in continuous mode.I used the same exact settings on both cameras (large Jpeg, P-mode, Quick AF). Compared to the instant responsiveness of the T2i, this was plain annoying and caused me to miss numerous shots. I used the same class 10 SDHC chip in both cameras, but -- this is interesting -- even without any memory chip in the camera, the delays are still there.","May 28, 2011",0
cameras,Not as easy to use as the 60D,bluecoyote,R1M3L0LKONEP4W,3,"Hopefully this will help someone who is undecided between the Canon T3i and the 60D. I last used a 35mm SLR about 15 years ago. I was used to being able to quickly and easily adjust aperture, iso and shutter speed. Since then I've used a progression of Canon digital point and shoots. When I got the T3i I was expecting a similar experience to my SLR days, but was sorely disappointed. To make changes with the T3i, you have to navigate through a difficult to use menu one the LCD display. With the 60D you're able make those changes much more easily without using the LCD menu. The small screen on top of the camera is a big help and displays the current settings. Otherwise the two cameras are capable of taking the same quality photographs.If you can, I would suggest trying both cameras out and seeing which you're more comfortable using.Pros for the 60D: Change settings more quickly, longer battery lifeCons for the 60D: Heavier and more expensivePros for the T3i: Lighter and less expensive.Cons for the T3i: More difficult to navigate menu and change settings, also shorter battery life","November 12, 2011",0

It's not a sealed body like the 7d, but if you care for it as you should anyway, that shouldn't be an issue. The only problem, which for us is HUGE, is that it will drain batteries within a few days when sitting OFF in a camera bag or on the shelf. It seems to use a huge amount of power when off. Called Canon and they said, ""yes, they can do that,"" like, ""so? did you have any other stupid questions?"" Our 7D and even the 60D never did that. The two Elph 300 camera's we use for quick shots of sets and what not will last MONTHS on a battery just sitting in an un-used state in the camera. This T3i will drain batteries if they are left in a camera body whether or not it's on, so we have to store batteries outside the camera. Which means it's no good for news or run and gun stuff. We're selling it and going to something else since we can't have a camera that drains a brand-new, fully charged Canon battery in three days while sitting on the shelf or that we have to find the battery to install it to take a quick shot. Low rating due to Canon's attitude when I've tried to deal with this issue.","June 21, 2012",0
cameras,"I really wanted to love it, BUT...",Carole M. Rickman,R1XVV3ZTJQ813A,3,"I chose this camera (after reading many reviews) based on it's low light capabilities. It does take very nice quality low light pictures as long as the subject is sitting still. The problem is I bought it to photograph my daughter's gymnastics meets. It is, in my opinion, one of the toughest things to shoot (and I've taken almost 30,000 pictures since I got my first digital camera in 2004)--low light, no ability to use flash, high speed, from a distance and people frequently walking in front of the subject. Unfortunately, this camera could not get the job done. The issue was the autofocus. I tested the sports setting, resetting aperature and shutter speed, and various focus settings. I just could not get a clear picture...and I shot almost 1400 before returning the camera. I opted for the Sony a55 and couldn't be happier! Crystal clear action shots with vivid color on the first try. I used a tamron 2.8, 70-200 lens & a tripod for both cameras so the only thing I can attribute the difference to is the camera itself. So, to sum it up...if you are only taking still pictures, the canon is fine BUT if you are shooting any movement at all, get the Sony.","January 31, 2012",0
cameras,Read this before you buy this camera - or if you have a problem with this camera,Barb,RPYP7WBSJR4KH,3,"I loved this camera when I got it a few weeks ago (not from amazon, as I got a better bundle price somewhere else - sorry amazon, it does happen on occasion :)I bought it for my daughters wedding (yeah, no pressure there, right?) and it worked until she was about to take her vows and then - stopped working (on auto). I freaked out (internally not visibly), but let it go and missed the shots :(This camera is touchy and apparently the lens focus can get stuck (it seems to be a common, unaddressed problem with this camera) when it's on auto. When that happens, it will not work in auto, period. When that happens, you have to pull on the lens focus ring, until you hear a click and then it will work again. And also - if it doesn't work on auto, immediately turn it to manual and it will work (most likely, as it did for me and many other people who own this camera). I found this out half by accident (the manual part, which I figured out halfway through my daughters wedding), and the other half from finding one awesome individual who had posted the fix for this, and left it online for 2 years. I am posting this on amazon because I do not want this to happen to Anyone else (and I look at amazon reviews and take them into consideration, before I purchase an expensive item, myself, so I would guess other people do too). Maybe all dslr cameras are touchy, I don't know, this is my first one. But I wanted to try and make sure no one else missed a pivotal moment, if the camera suddenly stopped working. I still love the camera, but I can only give it 3 stars due to the info I am passing on here is Not in the instruction manual(and it should be).I contacted canon about this issue and was told they did not have time to address every trouble shooting issue this camera could have. Even common issues, apparently. I was very disappointed in their customer service. And was even told - gee, look at all our great reviews on amazon. Which makes me wonder how many of the great reviews were written by people working for canon.

If you are looking to take rapid pics, this is not your camera. This is my first DSLR and even I thought it was slow. After doing more research I found out that if I paid $40 more, I could get the T4. Why wouldn't I do that? The T4 is faster, it has more MPs, it has a touch screen, and it can hold two memory cards. It has in camera HDR and video autofocus. Now when it originally came out the price was much higher and the T3 was a better bang for your buck, but ever since the price of the T4 came down, it makes no sense to to get the T3.","January 5, 2013",0

Basically it has sharper video, better remote functions with EOS Utility, EXCEPT on big negativeâ€¦no remote playback..you have to lean over the back of the camera and push a button if you are doing YouTube videos of yourself talking. The EOS Utility needs to have a remote playback. The audio sounds better but there is NO headphone out and Magic Lantern does not support this with the 600dâ€¦supposedly the next version will. But the audio out cable goes into the USB port, then same port that the EOS Utility uses to remotely use the camera. The third negative is the 12 minute record length before you are cut off and need to hit record again. But the EOS Utility sure beats the remote control on the M400. Maybe an Android remote to playback is offered but I downloaded Remote Controller App (beta) on my Nexus 10 and 7 and now neither one works, so that is an iffy process, especially with an OTG cable and all. Lots of people use the Zoom H4n external recorder and then sync up with the video in iMovie, FCP, Premiere Elements and Pro, but I don't want to hassle syncing, and I doubt if most people do.

cameras,At least a lap behind Nikon D5100,Henry H. Perritt,R318Y8NSNEY1F8,3,"I am an experienced still photographer, beginning to shoot movies. I already had a Nikon D5100 and love it. I needed a second camera for moviemaking and decided to try the EOS Rebel T3i, so I bought one and have been using it for a couple of months alongside the Nikon. It's okay for full-motion HD video, with somewhat more control over exposure than the Nikon.For still photography, it sucks. One of the motivations for a DSLR instead of a pocket digital camera is the expectation that the DSLR will take the picture when you press the button. The Canon T3i doesn't. The Nikon always does. This difference is infuriating. Any decent photographer knows when to take the picture. If the camera waits a couple of milliseconds--or full seconds, in the case of the Canon T3i--you can't capture the moment.It's also cheaply made, compared with the Nikon--all kinds of minor shortcuts to reduce the cost.I'm not sorry I bought it, but I am more than a little disappointed and will use the Nikon as my primary camera, with the Canon as a backup for movies, and leave it in the camera bag when I am shooting stills.","April 16, 2012",0

This severely hurts this camera's use for live practical applications (action, event, wedding). This would be an absolute deal killer for me but I got the camera for free. Otherwise I would've returned it. You shouldn't need manual to understand the basics of a camera in my opinion. It takes a while to get used to... and it's a style of camera I'd rather NOT get used to. Unintuitive. Seriously do not understand CANON's thinking. If I didn't shoot video for a living and if I had the money I would jump ship and stay with Nikon.- This camera is basically a poor man's studio camera that fronts as a easy-to use DSLR. It's not.- Megapixel count is slightly bloated. Again, you only need to extra pixel for editing. I also own a Nikin D90 with only 12M. Similar quality. Way better function!

Bought this camera, my first SLR, without any knowledge in photography. The camera is user friendly for the automatic mode, but I find that the automatic mode isn't much of an improvement from a regular P&S;: colors aren't great, camera is slow to focus, moving kids- pictures far from great. For the cost of 4 good P&S; cameras, I would expect MUCH better pictures. Either I take a course in photography, for which I definitely I don't have time, or take it back to the store, save some money and keep getting mediocre photographs with a cheaper P&S.;Another minus- got the lenses that come with the kit 18-55 and 55-250. The 55-250 doesn't shoot people that are close (you get the whole surroundings), but the 15-55 isn't enough zoom. Exchanging lenses in the middle of taking photographs- not doable (then you miss the picture you wanted, which was the idea of buying an SLR). Have to get some lens that covers more (such as 18-200).

However, this camera really doesn't have any standout features. Its the same old technology that has been around for years. You are still going to have to wait a ton of time between shots, the burst mode is slow, and the burst mode does not support focusing between shots. The view finder is not going to actually show you the picture you are going to get since it is an optical viewfinder. And the viewfinder is going to black out when you actually take the shot. Sure, all these traditional SLR cameras take great pictures, but really, what camera at this price doesn't. What are you really looking for at this price point? For me, it is fast between shots and can burst fast so I am sure to get a great shot. I hate cameras that make me wait between shots until the camera is ready to take another picture.If you want the hidden gem in the SLR camera world, check out the Sony SLT technology. It is a new technology that is much faster and allows the viewfinder and focus mechanisms to function like they should.

I also have a good canon HD video camera and a Nikon D40 dslr. I'm going to Florida in a week and wanted a great point and shoot that could do it all. I was going to only use the 300 HS and keep my video camera and DSLR at home. I did a lot of research and bought the ELPH 300 HS. I'm impressed with the features and the speed it can take photos. However I'm disappointed at the size of the videos, audio and very short battery life. I set the camera to 720P and recorded myself playing guitar for 10 minutes. I then loaded it onto my computer and noticed it took up 1.62GB of space. I compared this to a 10 minute 1080 video from my canon HD video camera and that only took up 800mb. There is no excuse why the 300 HS has to take up twice as much space on a ten minute video. For example the new flip video HD will record 2 Hours of HD video on only 8GB. If you recorded 2 hours on the 300HS at 720P (not even the highest setting) your looking at about 20GBs. Also there should not be a time limit of ten minutes for the videos. It should let you continue recording until the memory card is full (I have a 32GB card in the camera). On the plus side the video looks great, the camera focuses great and I like the slow zoom when recording. Now the thing that bothers me more then the size of the video is the static sound. It actually picks up sound very good with no distortions but there is what I can only describe as a water fall sound in the background during my videos (and there was no other sounds in the room that would cause this). I can not use this camera to record my guitar lessons or demos seeing as the water fall sound just kills it. I also only got about 150 pictures and just a few videos before the battery went dead. I do have another one I keep with me but this seems a little fast. If canon could fix the static/waterfall sound during recording, bring down the file size of the videos and kick up the battyer life a little this would be a perfect little camera.","April 2, 2011",0
cameras,I wanted to love it but...,tirah,R2DAKJ2HEP24FV,3,"I feel like Canon has been putting out products that aren't as well-made as before. I'm going to start with the design. I was glad they've added black in their color variation, but on this particular model the black is dull. Not sure if it's matte black, but there's a texture on it that I don't quite like. It feels alright when you've got slippery hands but the texture attracts dust like a moth to a flame. I wish Canon would adopt some design ideas from Sony or Samsung. The LCD screen feels like it's not secure, and if you look closely you can see the spaces between the lcd and the camera. The bottom right of the screen kind of pops up and i dont really feel good about it. I actually got a replacement because I thought the first one i had was a bad one, but the second one is just the same. I'm in the process of returning the replacement for a refund.What I liked about this camera was the ease of use and how fast it operated. The new HS system is really nice indeed. I don't think i liked the CMOS sensor though. It caused overexposure often, and colors were off and flat looking. I always had to use Vivid color mode which on my previous Canon Powershot was extremely vivid and saturated but on the 300 HS it's normal colors. I own a Canon T2i and a Panasonic LX3, i've tried numerous cameras in the past so I can say i know a thing or two about IQ. I am by no means a ""pro"" photog. I don't do ""portraits"" or those studio-like pictures but I am into still life and street photography. The Elph 300 HS is good for snapshots. Clear images with very minimal to no noise at all. It does smear a bit but isn't as bad. I wouldn't go above ISO800 though. And the i-Contrast is just horrible, don't use it you wont need it. The HD video is AMAZING, though the mic is super sensitive to wind so it's a little downside. I don't record video anyway. Most people who are getting this probably want it for low-light pictures. I'd have to say the low light performance is better than a regular Canon Powershot SD but don't expect wonders because it still has a small sensor and an aperture that isnt wide enough. If you want anything close to dSLR quality images, you'll be better with any of the advanced p&s; like the Canon S95, Panasonic LX5, Olympus XZ1, Samsung EX1 etc. All of those have a sensor of 1/1.7"" or bigger, and the Oly and Samsung have an aperture of 1.8! Another thing i want to bring up is the inconsistency of the images. The focus on this camera doesn't seem to be as effective as older models, so trying to shoot macro is a little bothersome because it takes several times for it to find the subject. I think for the price, it should perform a little better. My advice is to get the 100 HS and save $50, or spend a little more and get the SX210. If you're looking for best image quality as an alternative to a dSLR then you might want to get the advanced p&s; that i mentioned. if you just want a camera to take snapshots and want decent IQ, you would be fine with any of the Canon A series, even the SD1300 and SD1400.","June 9, 2011",0
cameras,"Good Features, Bad finish",Neo,R3IKI8F2R54RH4,3,"The 300 HS has good features and takes good photos. However, after about 4 days of use, it has developed numerous small radial dents in the bezel around the lens. This is rather troublesome for long term durability. The camera has been carried in my pocket and has been treated very well. I think Canon skimped on the finish and metal thickness of the bezel. Also the black finish around the bezel is easily mared. It's a great little camera in terms of features and photo quality, but I am considering returning it because of the issues stated above. I would think very carefully about purchasing this camera. See the review of the 300 HS at [...] He has similar conerns about dents in the bezel. Unfortunatly, I did not read Steve's review until after I purchased the camera. I am very disappoined in Canon on this issue. By the way, I have owned at least 25 digital cameras over the last 8 years (70% Canons) I have not seen an issue like this before. I believe that this is a design defect which could eventually effect picture quality.","May 5, 2011",0
cameras,Love this camera except....,Bigdogg88,R3SK1JTLCF0UB1,3,"I bought this camera to replace a Fujifilm f100 finepix camera that I loved after doing a lot of comparison reading on different models.I seldom ever give any credence to people who write a review after only having the camera for a couple of days, especially when they actually admit in writing that they haven't even read the user's manual yet, so I waited to write my review after using the camera for about a month, and approximately 300 pictures taken in different circumstances.All in all, I am very happy with the camera, its features as advertised, the feel of the camera, the ease of using it in quick situations since I use it mostly while I'm in Tijuana, so at times, I have to be quick and quiet when I take pictures, or else things can go from bad to worse in a tick of a second.The only complaint that I have is that the little protective shutter that covers the lens when the camera is shut off, now does not fully open when I turn on the camera, so what I now have to do is to GENTLY touch the little retractable protective shutters to get them to fully open when the unit is powered up, or to fully close when I shut the unit off.I'll send it back for warranty work as soon as I get the information back from Canon on where they want me to send it, but for the price of the camera, and what it does with the many features that it has, I am happy with the camera with no regrets in buying it since this is my first Canon digital camera.Would I buy another Canon point and shoot camera over a Fujifilm camera?Well the jury is still out on that one at this time, but depending on how Canon takes care of the warranty repair (time, speed of getting the camera back to me, etc) on getting my camera back to working like it is designed to do, will go a long way on either making me a loyal Canon customer or chalking it up to experience and going back to Fujifilm where the finepix f550 EXR is looking really good to me.","August 27, 2011",0
cameras,Nothing amazing here... just ok image quality,Sergei Bobyr,RL6HXR5PLAC1O,3,"Either people have lower expectations in terms of image quality or I got a lemon. I'm comparing mine to Canon S410 that I also own.Issues with this camera:1. Camera keeps switching 'scenes' in Auto mode and it's often choosing incorrectly: a) It tries to do tracking when no tracking is required b) It often fails to detect macro mode2. Focusing algorithm in Auto mode often refuses to choose a subject that I'm actually interested in. Example: it would often ignore people in the foreground and focus on some background instead.=> 1 and 2 make Auto mode unusable for me...3. Focus is soft most of the time (S410 didn't have this problem). Focus is especially soft in image corners. Changing ""Sharpness"" in Custom Colors in Program mode does help a bit.4. In macro mode it's often impossible to make it focus on the feature you want even using Program mode with center focusing with small frame size (S410 didn't have this problem). It would either not focus at all or claim it focused producing an image that is visibly out of focus. I had many flowers that 300 HS would refuse to focus on while S410 focused just fine.5. Noticeable chromatic aberrations in high contrast photos: anything bright will have an aura around it.6. Noticeable barrel distortion at widest angle: don't photograph people unless they are in the center of the shot.7. It tends to overexpose outdoor pictures.8. It likes to set aperture to f/8.0 (and sometimes above) instead of staying at f/2.7. This adds to image softness.What I do like:1. It's small and light.2. It shoots surprisingly good movies.3. It performs reasonably well under low light conditions (CMOS sensor vs. CCD in S410).I use mine in Program mode only, center focus, with sharpness tuned all the way up.","October 26, 2011",0
cameras,Dissappointed,"AZ Desert Rat ""movie buff""",R10BODZ51W83XH,3,"I have a Canon SD1100is and was very pleased with the picture quality. I then purchased a Panasonic Lumix DMCZS7 and was blown away by the quality and picture clarity. But I missed having a small camera like the SD1100 to take to parties etc. I wanted something to just slip in my pocket, and I wanted a wide angle lens that the SD1100 did not possess. The ELF300 is a perfect size for tucking in your shirt pocket or pant pocket. However it does not take nearly as clear pictures as my old SD1100.I have played around with the camera for a few weeks and found that it does not focus exactly where it should. I am stumped because I have never had that problem with either of my two other cameras. At first I felt like I was doing something wrong. I tried each focusing format and it never came out as clear as the SD1100.I am really disappointed in this from Canon.

cameras,LCD Image Brightness and Flash Too Bright,H. Friedman,RBQON8ULPROK4,3,"After reading most of the reviews, I decided that this would be a great gift for my sisters birthday. The price was affordable and there did not seem to be much of a huge difference upgrading to the newer models. In addition, I was looking for a simple point and shoot camera that would take quick shots, to avoid that ""oh please take that damn shot"" moment, as you wait. The specs state 1.5 seconds, which is very respectable... until you use the flash. More on this below.This camera is very compact and easy to store in your pocket. The video is pretty clear and easy to record. The buttons are located in good locations and the color Red was very well received, making it easy to locate.Now for the problems:1) IMAGE BRIGHTNESS ON LCD SCREEN: The major problem, at least with the camera we received, is that the image brightness displayed on the screen does not match to those you will see on your computer. Of course, this is not a surprise, since the lcd on the camera only shows a small amount of pixels but the problem is not the clarity or color, but that of brightness. Photo's taken in low light situations with no flash will look bright enough on the camera's display but once you transfer to your computer, they are very completely dark and extremely grainy. Likewise, photo's taken with a flash look washed out on the screen but once transferred, look not as bright. Decreasing the screen brightness on the camera did nothing to elevate this issue. Defective screen?2) FLASH TOO BRIGHT:The flash is too bright and not controllable in either automatic or manual modes. This results in photo's that look too flash exposed and too many highlights in the face. Luckily, if the ISO setting is low enough, the photo's can be corrected in any photo editing software.3) AUTO ISO TOO HIGH & GRAINY: Although automatic mode is indeed handy for people who do not want to or know how to adjust settings. The flaw here is that the Auto mode decides which ISO setting to use, which in most situations is exceptionally high (i.e ISO 400 with Flash, ISO 1600 without). The higher the ISO the more grainy the images will be and the less pixel brightness information you have for photo retouching or correcting.The fix for this is to use manual mode and change the auto ISO to a value of 100 or 200. Make sure that your flash is set to auto or OFF, and this should result in a much better quality looking image with no pixel grain. When the flash goes off, you might get an overexposed image that is too bright, but since you have a lot of pixel information, you will most likely be able to adjust that in any photo editing software.4) TOO SLOW WITH FLASH: Although photo's taken without a flash are taken at an impressive 1.5 seconds, once you include the flash, that time dramatically increases to 3-4 seconds, where your models have to wait patiently with there frozen smiles that turn to grins.IMPROVEMENTS NEEDED (likely by purchasing another model):1) ISO Max, this way you can guarantee that the camera won't select such a high setting of ISO 1600. ISO 400 should really be the high limit.2) Flash brightness control. This would eliminate the need to correct for this in a photo editor. Auto Flash brightness based on ISO would be ideal.3) Ability to reuse last auto setting for next photo. This way, the camera does not need to recalculate focus, red eye, settings, etc all over again.4) An LCD that displays correct brightness of photo's taken (if my camera is not a defect).NOTE: In my defense, I should have been more aware that taking photo's in low lighting would result in a high AUTO ISO setting of 1600. I actually didn't notice that ISO until the day after. However, when I viewed this through the camera's lcd screen, they looked quite bright (even the darks were bright enough) and overexposed when using a Flash. Being very impressed with the low lighting photo's, I decided to avoid using the flash for more than half the photo's..... BIG MISTAKE.","April 15, 2012",0
cameras,Disappointed with the quality and user interface,A.N.,R3IO25ADL7WU3A,3,"I am a big fan of Canon. I have ventured out and bought Pentax and Fuji cameras, but in comparison, the Canons are always better. Until now. I bought this camera to replace my previous one that was going on the blink. I don't blame canon for the longevity...I use and abuse my cameras, so I need to get a new one about once/year. However, the 300HS is a disappointment. I thought the ""HS"" technology would give me amazing picture quality...but I honestly don't see much of a difference. They have also made a bunch of changes to the interface that make it more difficult to use. They did stupid things like bury the erase function in the menus (rather than just being a physical button). I feel the slow-motion video is probably the only differentiating feature with this camera, but the image size is so poor it's only for amusement.The only reason I gave this camera 3 stars rather than fewer, is that it's image quality is average and the slim shape with rounded corners slips into your pocket nicely.I bought mine for $299, and have now seen them for $229.","May 9, 2011",0

cameras,Auto focus? No focus!,Irene,R7LAZ9YLFOOYF,3,"Pros: This camera performs better than my Panasonic ZS5 in low light indoor conditions, but that's where it's benefits end.Cons: Lots of blurry and not sharp pictures in normal light situations - where you would think camera should perform ""great"". Also, it's auto focus is the worst: you might want to take a picture of a walking person or moving object, but it will focus on a fence, you will want to take a picture of a building - but it will focus on a branch of a nearby tree. You can tweak the settings, force infinity mode - but nonetheless, after my smart Panny the performance is extremely frustrating (keep in mind that they are selling for almost the same price nowadays). Macro shots - look decent, but the ones coming out of Panny still have more details and are more sharp.I also feel that there is a lack of scene settings: they have added some ""extra"" modes - like miniature effect and fisheye - but i really think it's pure BS - wish they have concentrated on features that are truly usable.After playing with this cam and comparing pictures to my old one, i'm returning this one - dont want to wait until it becomes totally unusable.","March 22, 2012",0

cameras,Not as good picture quality as older SD models.,GVK,R3GGYD4WWIW30G,3,"Received and returned Canon 300 HS which I bought hoping to improve on my Canon SD1200. The picture resolution was inferior to the SD1200 across the whole zoom range. My other, older SD450 was just as good in picture quality as the SD1200, if not better. Seems as the new models come out with more features like better video, more megapixels, more zoom, etc., the picture (lens?} quality deteriorates. If improved movies and wide angle zoom is important to someone, one may decide to settle for somewhat inferior pictures and buy this otherwise nice camera.","July 11, 2011",0
cameras,"decent camera but I would not recommend it, especially for the money!",PornStar,R2Y70J6K32I87Y,3,"LIKES: 1) Good image quality, very neutral color and smooth, records HD video with zoom. 2) Extremely compact. 3) User friendly and logically placed controls - such as the quick 1-touch video and the slide lever to switch the program/auto mode. 4) Brisk, quick operation such as the start up and shot-to-shot times. 5) Bright LCD visible even under the bright sunlight. 6) Decent battery life.DISLIKES: 1) The LCD is very low in resolution, looks like it's from 2003. Many pictures looked sharp on the LCD even when zoomed in, but they were blurry on the computer screen. I do not have this problem with my similarly priced Sony WX9 which has a super high resolution LCD. 2) Rounded, curved, bubbly design maybe cute but it is slippery in the hand, increasing the chance of you dropping it. Also it will not stand upright easily, it is very tippy. Which means if you set it on top of something to snap a timed picture or a night shot, there is good chance it will tip over, drop, and get heavily damaged. 3) All images are VERY SOFT even at the finest compression setting. There is no way to crank up the sharpness inside the camera. Expect to use software to crank up the sharpness on EVERY image you decide to keep, which is a tedious and time-consuming task. 4) The HD video is limited to only 10 minutes which is stupid and just short enough to piss you off. On the Sony WX9 recording time is limited as well, but at 29 minutes, it is decent and just long enough to be satisfying because usually the battery will expire before the cut off time. It also gobbles up a HUGE amount of memory as well! 5) Battery cover looks and feels EXTREMELY flimsy. Opening the cover shuts off the camera, which means hot swapping memory cards is not possible. It takes quite a bit of force with your thumb to close the slippery cover, and it feels very unrefined, coarse and cheap with no positive tactile sensation at all. It also feels like it's going to break any minute which is annoying.","October 24, 2011",0
cameras,Canon is riding on it's name.,"Stephan Krasner ""User1000101001001""",R1OBDBROAG43BH,3,"The Canon I had before this one was more expensive ($250) but not that much more expensive and it took way better pictures with a superior build quality. The body was metal, but the battery/SD compartment felt cheap and flimsy as did the zoom control ring around the shutter button. A 240k LCD may have been good 3 years ago but my cell phone has had a better LCD for years, it's definitely an important part of the camera so you can see what you have shot in the field. They should have stepped it up a little more here. The form factor on the other hand is VERY good. It's the best looking small camera I have ever owned. The controls on the 300 hs are better than my old Canon.Despite having a back-lit CMOS chip, pictures indoors were washed out, blurry and extremely grainy. My old canon had this problem too, in fact ALL Canon compacts have this problem. They cannot seem to perform well indoors. The photos were either washed out so you could not see any detail, or they were grainy and blurred. Think night time security camera.Outdoors, the performance improves significantly, but still not enough to replace my old Canon. Bright light will completely blow out objects. Distortion is harsh outside around the edges of the photo. Trees for example become silhouetted by light lines. Outdoors on a sunny day is usually where canon compacts shine, but the 300sh is a big disappointment here. The colors however were extremely accurate, but if you are looking for a camera to take to the slopes, look elsewhere. I took it to a football game expecting to get some good action shots and almost every shot was blurred and hazy IN BROAD DAYLIGHT!The macro was the biggest disappointment of them all. This is usually another point where canon compacts shine, but with this one, I had a very hard time focusing on what I wanted, shots also blur a lot easier than my old camera. I am a big fan of macro sots. this is one point that has inspired me to return the camera. Honestly my Blackberry torch does smoother macro than this one...At one time cheap canon compacts were my instant go-to solution for a carry around. This camera felt like an old camera. From the screen to the images, complete disappointment all around. I have since switched to the Sony Cybershot WX9 and I can say with out a doubt that you are getting more bang for your buck, and way better picture quality.","December 2, 2011",0
cameras,What the specs don't say,T. D.,R2ZOOYCFTKREGX,3,"I've owned/used many Canon's over the years both professionally and for personal use. Canon knows what their doing. Going by the specs I don't dive too deep because I've never been unhappy with Canon. I breeze past low-ball ratings because people can't figure it out or don't like a feature. I've found a few fundamental problems with this camera.The focus on the camera in general is great but the speed between you pressing the button and it shooting is way too long. Low or high light.The flash takes literally 10 seconds before you can take another photo. I understand this is a point and shoot, but thats insane. I've used a lot of cameras and 10 seconds is way too long. Tell a one year old to hold that pose. Good luck. You just missed it.The battery is weak. I've taken great care to properly charge this battery and have cycled through it about 10x and it's gotten a bit better. You'll need to buy a few more so you can use this camera like a normal one. Shooting video kills it as expected but 15 minutes of 1080 will fully kill this battery. 15 Minutes. I've played with the auto focus and the focus settings but it's still a battery killer. I'm fully aware that video will kill these but seriously 15 minutes. So take video out of the mix and you'll still get hopefully 50-75 photos. Flash also throws a wrench into the battery of course so cut that number by 50%. I have 3 batteries so this isn't a bad battery I got from Canon.It's a bad design or bad firmware because if this is how it's supposed to work this is my last Canon. That said, when it works it looks really nice. I'm even happy with the video. Canon still has a chance to fix this camera with firmware and I sure hope they do. The size is perfect but can we all agree it's thin enough? Can we make some/any advance in battery life? This camera went backwards. I'd understand about the flash's refire rate or the slow focusing if the battery lasted longer. It would make sense. Seriously, make it thicker if you can't shoehorn a bigger battery in.","February 4, 2012",0
cameras,I really want to like this camera!,Dan Au Hoy,R3LGVMZ595DRN0,3,"This camera's build is very nice! Good finish and feel. Buttons are easy to use, unless you have very large hands.Outdoor photos in natural light are mostly good but the widest angle has severe distortion at the edges.Low light photos without flash are good due to the CMOS sensor.Taking indoor photos with flash is another story. The auto white balance rarely gets it right, unfortunately. Again the widest angle which I thought useful indoors in limited spaces, severely distorts everything but the center. The flash cycles very slowly also, probably due to the small battery capacity.I'm disappointed with this camera in general, I was expecting better results. My SD1200 took much better photos.I would recommend this camera with some reservations, but I would not buy this camera again.","December 10, 2011",0
cameras,I expected more from a Canon,Anthony Louis,R38KQIAG0KANEB,3,"I got this camera a week ago and have been disappointed. I decided on Canon because I had one years ago and really liked it. The quality seems to have gone downhill. The best feature is the compact size. I find the ""smart auto"" not to be so smart. The images are usually over-exposed and at times out of focus. It's as if the camera can't figure out what I want to photograph and instead picks some detail I'm not interested in. The menus are not obvious and I have to keep running to the computer to read the manual, which is not very handy if I'm away from the computer. I got this to replace an old HP digital camera that took great photos. The image quality of the Canon is much worse. I suspect that the HP had a much better quality lens. The battery needs to be recharged after about 170 photos. I haven't tried the video yet, but I suspect that will shorten the battery life even more. I was used to taking 250-300 photos with my previous camera before changing the battery. I read some reviews that said not to even bother with the smart auto mode and I think they are right. I need to experiment with the ""P"" mode to see if I can get some decent photos with this camera. I had considered getting a cheaper model of the Canon powershot camera but opted for this more expensive one because of the extra feature. I think the extra money was not well spent since the Canon ELPH 300 performs about as well as a camera costing half as much. To be fair, I've only had the camera a week and there is a steep learning curve. If things improve over the next few weeks, I'll add an update and may give this camera a higher rating. At this time I'm feeling disappointed.Addendum (6/5/11): I've now had several more days to play with the camera and after trying all kinds of settings the picture quality is not much better. I finally made some videos, which looked nice, but the microphones picked up a lot of extraneous noise even indoors in a quiet room and introduced a kind of background hum into the audio. If the quality of sound doesn't matter to you, the videos are quite nice. I've decided to keep the camera because it's so compact and I plan to take it on trips. The photos are passable but nothing spectacular. The problems with focusing and overexposure have continued. I think the lens is just not as good quality as in previous cameras I've owned, including an old Canon. Maybe the fault lies in me since I'm not an expert on photography. A friend who is a serious photographer offered to go over the camera with me, so after we get together I'll have a better idea.Addendum (6/24/11): I had this camera for over 3 weeks now and have taken hundreds of photos with it. My original impression has not changed. It takes decent photos in general. The AUTO feature is useless and needs to be avoided outdoors because it totally over-exposes the photos. It's kind of ludicrous that you can't use the AUTO feature outdoors on a point and shoot camera. Indoors the AUTO function is acceptable. The Programable mode does a better job, and it's all that I use now. Generally I'm disappointed with the quality of the images and It think this has to do with the cheap lens this camera uses. As I said previously, it is nowhere near the quality of previous Canon cameras I have owned. The best feature is the small size of the camera, so I will be keeping it and using it on vacations because it is so portable.","June 1, 2011",0

cameras,One Year Review of Elph 300 HS,Marty,RDO6U2RWRS5ZV,3,"I've had this camera now for a year, and here are my thoughts:1) Nice and compact, I can wear it around my neck (neck strap not included, you must find one separately) all day and not notice the weight.2) You can't take a pic unless you have a camera, and you don't have to worry about the weight making you keep it at home.3) The black paint wears off a lot over time, exposing bare metal underneath. I originally wanted a silver model, but the store didn't have it in stock. I would NEVER buy a black camera again, the re-sale value from the chipped paint would be zero, I think.4) Picture quality is not up to par with bigger-lens point and shoots or SLRs. But again, unless you have a camera on you, you can't take a pic.5) The focus accuracy is good in pic mode. In video mode, it's poor, for the lens will seek out the correct focus and go in and out of focus. If you're taking an important video, leave this camera at home. I have an older Canon point and shoot (A620) and the focus is excellent in video mode. If video focus is important, don't buy this camera. The focus problem exists whether recording or simply using it as a live monitor feed.6) Dust gets inside the lens and you'll get dark spots on every image, more so when you zoom in. Since the camera is now out of warranty, I opened the camera up, moved the LCD upwards, unscrewed the image sensor, and cleaned the clear plastic that covers the lens with a Q-tip. The big spots are gone now, but little ones remain. My A620 has no spots at all, and it's many years old. I had a Sony point and shoot years ago and that too had a dust problem. I might buy the Sony with the fixed lens (the one where the cover slides upwards and downwards) to help avoid dust problems.7) The 24 mm (if memory serves) equiv. zoom gives nice wide-angle shoots, but there is distortion. That was to be expected.So would I buy it again? Well, all in all, I would likely have another look at competing choices.","July 17, 2012",0

Trusting in Canon's reputation for quality I proceeded to unpackaging the rest of the accessories and charged up the battery.I at first bought the red case version after looking at the black version on display. I was disappointed that the red doesn't have the rubberized finish of the black.

I don't recall bumping it, dropping it or doing anything that should produce such a huge scratch. So I wrapped it up and took it back and got it exchanged for the black case version. I'm hoping I just got a defective coating on that one, but do be cautious of the camera's finish if you opt for a colored one.I've been using the black case version since May 2011, and have been pretty happy with it. The wider angle lens as compared to my SD780 is definitely nice. And I am able to get better shots in low light conditions. All and all tho, I consider this a transitional camera that I'll upgrade to something else soon enough. After just a few months of use, I feel ready for something better.","November 25, 2011",0

cameras,"Great outdoors, terrible indoors.",carol a mcveigh,R1WD1GOI23N296,3,"I just used this camera to take pictures of my hikes in Canyonlands national Park, the Needles. It takes great outdoor photos, true to life color, great focus and definition, and it's small, so it fits easily into your pocket. I would recommend this camera for outdoor pictures. But, indoor photos are a different story. I am very disappointed with the camera's performance. It is so slow to focus that when I can finally take the snap-shot the moment has passed, and I get an unwanted, terrible photo. And, it takes a few seconds before it can take a second photo. I got this to take photos of my new puppy, and it is practically useless!! I have to use my 8 year old Canon instead. I do not recommend this camera for indoor use at all.","May 22, 2013",0
cameras,Compact but so so pics,bluemoon,R117PEPVR0O6DQ,3,"Recently purchased this camera elsewhere...Amazon you need to reduce your prices a lot more..I got the red one for even cheaper than the price of your black one.Anyway, previously had an Olympus Fe340, 8MP, great little camera with excellent photo quality, unfortunately one day it just stopped working so I needed a new one. My first digital was Canon and still going strong so I figured I'd return to Canon...after reading reviews here and elsewhere I decided on this one. I've only used it a little bit as I also bought a Samsung Galaxy S2 smartphone...I should have listened to those around me, camera wasn't necessary..the picture quality of this camera is only slightly better than my phone..I expected sharper images with 12MP, instead pictures are comparable to my 8MP phone. The camera is very light,compact and easy to use..didn't need to read manual to get going with it...just pop in battery (needs charging as only little juice when out of box)memory card and off you go.

cameras,Kind of regret getting this camera.,AJ Quick,R1UC6B62QTXA74,3,"I do like this particular camera for its asthetics and HD video capability. I've owned it for a few months now and it REALLY doesn't do a good job for what I need it for. I take mostly close up photos against a white background and some minor background lighting. This camera cannot handle macro mode very well. More times than not, the photo ends up blurry. It also likes to not use the flash in situations that probably call for it. There is no way to force the flash that I can see. Its too bad when you have just enough light for the camera to think it doesn't need a flash, but you feel it needs one. Ultimately the photo suffers. And speaking of the photos. There is something very wonky with the color profile. When I adjust the tone, brightness and contrast of the photo in photoshop it always pushes the photo into a darker range and the colors are always a little bit off of what they should be. Its not a horrible camera. I'm sure it works much better doing outdoor photos in daylight, or photos from several feet away. Its just horrible for close up photos with indoor lighting (even in macro mode). HD video and slow motion are really nice though!","March 21, 2012",0
cameras,Taking it Back,"Steve Bennett ""stevebenett""",R1PMU4W9IAEOAV,3,"I'm an advanced amateur, but still an amateur. I have an old Kodak that's painfully slow to get ready to take pictures, and has very poor video. I thought this one would work. Portability is great. The rechargable battery lasted very nicely (beyond 150 pics and multiple videos). The outside shots are fine, in fact pretty nice by my view. Inside shots set on auto are either blurry/grainy with no flash or grainy/orange with a flash. The video is nice, but that's about all. I'm a novice. I need point and shoot for the most part. Some macro. I set this on auto and get pictures worse than my 5 year old kodak. I give it three stars for the battery life, portability, outside shots and video but that's it. I repeat that I'm a novice. I may be missing some setting or option for clearer pictures. Right now, though, I'll stick with my kodak.","May 10, 2011",0

cameras,Elph 300 review,DT,R8437OA4ZQH8X,3,"I've had this camera 4 months. Was wanting a small, light camera for hiking and backpacking. Needed to take HD video. After reading tons of reviews, I bought this camera because it is one of those rare ones that allow you to use the zoom while shooting video, continuously focuses, adjusts for changing light and has Image stabilization. I'm happy with the video. The audio, wind noise is typical of every camera that uses the mic type that these do. I'm in the process of making a dead rat to encompass the whole camera, as even handling the body of the camera introduces unwanted noise.The pictures tho are very disappointing. You'd think for any camera approaching 10mp the pictures would be sharp and crisp with some nice detail. No so with this camera. It seems to have a lot of useless effects, but lacks important options like a sharpness setting. If you're taking landscape type pictures with this camera, expect soft, bland, detail-less pictures, especially of trees, foliage, bushes, grass, rocks. Detail and color are blotchy. I quit using it on Auto and use the Program setting all the time now to try to salvage what I can out of it.My Canon A620 7mp takes better pictures.","December 26, 2011",0

It can only serve as a travel camera that has better pictures than cellphones.My very first Canon digital camera was also purchased from Amazon. It was way back in 2004 and the model was S500. Unfortunately, my mother-in-law broke it four years ago. If my memory serves right, the old one gave better picture quality than this new one.Pro1. compact2. battery lasts a whole day with full charge (600 pictures, some flashes, a couple videos)4. cosmetically pleasing5. enough picture quality for web sharing and 4x6 printsCon1. really soft images (focusing problem?)2. clear distortion at wide (24mm) and tele focal length3. video not true HD quality and taking humongous space comparing to any digital camcorder4. the advertised high-ISO sensitivity was achievable but at expense of very soft focus and blur (slow shutter speed)5. could have been more useful if aperture/speed/manual program was avaiableIn short, this camera did not meet my expectation. It was not much better than my old Canon compact. If you want to upgrade from your cellphone pictures, this could be it.

cameras,Good camera - don't buy the black one!,Bob Jones,R10CQ07ZUKPKRC,3,"This is my 3rd canon digital elph, and hopefully not my last one (I'm only replacing the previous model because American Airlines shattered it). Amazon was out of the silver model when I bought it, so I got the black one. That was a mistake. It's got some sort of texture to it that just makes it horrible to handle. It's rough, it feels bad coming in an out of your pocket, a case, whatever. Cleaning the screen is almost impossible because the ""texture"" grabs hold of most soft cloths that you would use. I could easily see this snagging a sweater, etc. The only thing I could imagine this texture would be for is improved grip, but honestly, I don't think that's ever been a problem for anyone. These things are so light that it takes almost no effort to hold on to them. The texture also collects any dirt or other particles around it. After 5 minutes in my pocket (this is a pocket camera, after all) with what appeared to be a completely clean/empty hard candy wrapper, the camera came out covered in pink mess. Also, the wrist strap on this model wasn't soft and flexible, but instead very stiff. If I wasn't wearing it, but just grabbed the camera for a quick snapshot, I had to be very careful that the strap didn't stick straight out into the picture. That should never be a problem one has to worry about.The picture quality on this camera isn't quite as good as it was on my previous model (SD770IS). The quality isn't quite as sharp, the colors aren't quite as good, etc. I can only hope that my particular camera was a fluke, both in the quality of the pictures and the roughness of the textures. Come to think of it, I may pick up a different model instead of another one of these - maybe the SD4000IS or SD4500IS.","July 18, 2011",0

I hate small CMOS sensor!!!If the photo quality of DSLR is 100, S95 could be 80, and this one, I think just 40!!The only one thing makes me still keeping this, is this camera has amazing DV quality. The quality of HD movie generated by this ELPH300 is even better than many camera-recorders, but it is really small and easy to carry.

My wife tends to put aesthetics before technical features and she didn't like the look of the camera. I have to admit, the black plastic buttons did look quite cheap-and-nasty.Also, she wanted a panoramic mode like my more expensive Sony camera. Although the description does say that there's a panoramic mode, it just means that the camera will help you take consecutive pictures that can later be combined into a panoramic mode using some PC software. The camera itself doesn't create a panoramic picture (unlike my Sony).In the end we swapped the Canon for a similar-priced Sony camera (DSC-W570) which looked much nicer and had a panoramic mode. This camera seemed to be simpler to operate too, compared to the Canon.In summary, we didn't actually use the Canon camera so I can't comment on the quality of the pictures, but this review is just to highlight a couple of things that I didn't see in other Amazon reviews.","March 2, 2012",0

cameras,DETAILED COMPARISON OF Panasonic TS3 to Sony TX10,SammiMur,R2ZECGQZS7CYSD,3,"First, some background on what I was looking for: I'm a casual photographer. I wanted a waterproof camera which would produce high-quality photos in all settings (indoor, outdoor, and underwater. My intention was to completely replace my 7.2MP Sony DSC-W7, which I LOVE. I wanted to add the underwater feature without compromising on other features. I did not want to spend more than about $400 for everything (camera, two 8GB memory cards (Class 10), two extra batteries with charger, and float strap. This left me with about $340 max to spend on the camera itself. I do NOT know a lot about photography. Terms like ""ISO"" and ""white balance"" are foreign to me. I like to use pre-programmed scene modes and auto features. I enjoy digital scrapbooking and I frequently zoom and crop. It takes a very high quality photo to crop out/enlarge a small figure without too much distortion.I began my search online and spent about 6 hours researching the cameras in my price range. The cameras I focused on most were the Canon D10, Sony TX10, Panasonic TS3 (sometimes referred to as FT3), Olympus TG-810, Olympus Tough 8010, Fujifilm XP30, and Pentax WG-1.I eliminated most of these options rather quickly based on their reviews, overall ratings, and the quality of photos that I reviewed. I narrowed my focus to the Canon D10, the Sony TX10, and the Panasonic TS3.I wanted to love the Canon D10, since it seems to be the overwhelming fan favorite, but I ultimately decided that it wasn't going to be a good fit for me. The price of the D10 is similar to the Sony and the Panasonic, but it's a 2.5 year old model which doesn't have HD video. The photo quality seemed about equivalent to the other two, so I decided to only focus on the two models with HD video.I would have been completely sold on the Sony, since I've used only Sony cameras most of my adult life and I've never been disappointed in one; however, there were some notable deficiencies which most reviewers found with this model (detailed below), so I was a bit hesitant to take the plunge. The Sony was also priced near the top of my budget ($329), whereas the Panasonic was only $275 at Amazon.com. The Panasonic reviews seemed to all be very positive, with the only significantly commonly-noted problem being lower quality indoor photos. However, all of the indoor, outdoor, and underwater photos that I reviewed online looked very good.I decided to take a chance on the Panasonic TS3 and I really, really, wanted to fall in love with it. I ordered it from Amazon and they delivered it the next day. I wasn't blown away by this camera. The outdoor photos were good. The video was very good. The underwater photos (taken in my large fish tank) were very good. The indoor photos were POOR. I decided to order the Sony TX10, hoping that I'd see better results. I ordered it from Amazon at 9pm that night and it was delivered at 1:00pm the next day (gotta love Amazon!). The photo quality of the Sony camera is outstanding. I'll be keeping the Sony TX10!!! For some people, however, the Panasonic might be the better choice.First, I'll provide my overall recommendations, then I'll add in all of the detail:BUY THE SONY TX10 IF:You value the quality of the photos/video above all else.You like touch screen devices.You don't plan to dive lower than 16 feet.You don't care if you can't adjust your settings (other than zoom) underwater.You want a VERY small camera.You always use a wrist strap.BUY THE PANASONIC TS3 IF:You can live with grainy indoor photos.You don't typically enlarge your photos to 100% (because they will be distorted).You want a camera with GPS.You plan to dive deeper than 16 feet.You want a larger (but not too big) camera.You're looking for a less expensive option.NOW FOR MY DETAILED COMMENTS ON BOTH MODELS:PRICE - The Sony is +/- $50 more expensive than the Panasonic.SIZE - The Sony is significantly smaller and lighter than the Panasonic. I don't think one is better than the other, per se. It's a matter of personal preference. The Sony will fit in most pockets. The Panasonic probably wouldn't.RUGGEDNESS - Both cameras are rated very well in this area. I haven't ""tested"" them, but it seems like the Panasonic is built a bit tougher and would be less likely to get destroyed in a fall. Rather than test this feature, I'm going to just trust the experts that either one will hold up well if dropped.","August 20, 2011",0
cameras,"Nice rugged camera (with some caveats, see updates)",MikeF,R37Q4L94QNNT6P,3,"Had my TS3 for about a week and I have to say it looks snazzy in blue. It has so many features that it is going to take a while to figure them all out. Actually most of the features allow the camera to take better pictures in a wide variety of conditions automatically (iA modes). It is definitely more rugged and ergonomic than the TS1 I lost :(. You do have to be careful how you hold the camera on the left side as a finger could easily block the lens or cover the mic.I was very happy with my previous TS1 and I can already tell the TS3 it is as good or better in terms of picture quality. I have taken a series of indoor and outdoor shots, with and without flash, macro to full zoom, and overall the sharpness, color and light balance where very good. So far I liked the ""intelligent"" features like iExposure, iISO and iZoom and decided to leave them on. HD video looks great and the anti-shake works very well while walking with the camera.GPS, one of the main reasons I bought this camera, is a little tricky. If you turn it on it stays on even when the camera is off so it can keep track of it's position, however I am not sure how the battery will last in this mode? The manual says it will eventually shut off if the camera is not used for an extend amount of time (doesn't state how long that is) or if the battery become to low. If you put it in the airplane mode, the GPS shuts off when you turn of the camera, which will conserve power, but it takes a few minutes to acquire when you turn the camera back on. I am probably going to leave it in the airplane mode but will switch to ON if I plan to take pictures for an extend amount of time so it is ready to go and I am sure for that short of time the drain won't be an issue. In any case it is good to have spare battery charged up in the camera case.Speaking of cases I also picked up a Lowepro Rezo 30 compact case which fits the TS3 perfectly, and is very well built with an extra pocket that holds pretty much everything I could want including the case strap, extra memory card, USB SD card reader stick, and extra battery very nicely. Highly recommended and a great value. Lastly picked up two Wintec 16GB SDHC Class 10 Flash memory cards. I wanted 32 GB of memory to be able to record video and photos but didn't want to chance having one card in case it died so I bought two 16 GB cards. I am not a fan of Transcend cards from my experience with them on my TS1, so I did some searching and saw all 5 star reviews on every site I found the Wintec card. All I can say is these cards work great! I had no problem recording HD video and they are very fast at pulling off data with my USB2 reader. Add in a lifetime warranty and they are an amazing value!Update: Be sure you update the camera to the latest firmware. Mine came with V1.0 and Panasonic recently released V1.1 which I installed and it definitely helps GPS acquisition and location handling.Update 2: I finally had a chance to use the camera underwater in the Philippines on a several snorkeling trips. First trip was great, no problems, and got awesome pictures and video. Two days later on another trip, water got in the camera and it would not power on. Made sure seals were clean and rinsed it off with clean water afterwards, on each use. If you look at all the 1 star reviews on this camera most are related to water leak problems, which is about 10% of the 300 reviews! Luckily Panasonic replaced it under warranty, but it took about a month to get. Not wanting to get bit again, I also bought this Lewis N. Clark Waterproof Multi Purpose Pouch for double safety and found it to work great and it is a nice fit for this camera, highly recommended! I also notice problems with the GPS recognizing many of my locations in the Philippines, including Puerto Princessa, which is one of the largest cities and only about half of my pictures were geo-tagged even though GPS was set to ""ON"" all the time. If geo-tagging is important to you I highly recommend downloading Google's free photo editor ""Picasa"" which is great for viewing and editing geo-tag information. I orginally rated it 4 stars but because of problems I've had with waterproofing and GPS I changed it to 3 stars.","April 11, 2011",0
cameras,"Picture Quality Very Good, Usability So-So","H. Sansom ""huw_the_book""",R1JQ2I9RYIT800,3,"[Updated at bottom]I have used some 20 or 30 cameras over the past 15 years -- point and shoots like this, video cameras, film cameras and film and digital SLRs. The Panasonic Lumix is a very nice point and shoot, but there are definite issues.... I have _not_ tested it underwater as of this writing (May 16, 2011).Pluses:1. Outstanding exposure balance. High-contrast shots will be well-balanced between light and dark areas. You will see detail in the shadows and in the highlights. This is a significant strength.2. Nice and sharp for a camera with a point-and-shoot sized sensor but a high resolution (12 megapixels).3. Excellent color balance. Images are not over-saturated, something I've seen frequently. The camera does give you a good deal of control over color.4. There is comparatively little barrel distortion when close to subjects.Cons:1. You do not get as much control over shooting as you do with comparable Canon point-and-shoots. Canon allows you more control over what happens when -- like the flash firing. With the Lumix, the Flash is either on or off. The camera tends to use the Flash when it is not really necessary.2. Accurate and rapid focusing is poor. If you hope to catch something quickly, forget about it. My camera sometimes doesn't get _anything_ in focus.3. As with most point-and-shoots, the aperture is small, so if you want to get a nice sense of depth, you will be disappointed.4. The macro feature is especially frustrating. For some reason, it sometimes fails to turn on. The focusing issues are worse with the macro feature.5. Some features remain on or off after restarting the camera, others don't. If you turned off the flash, that will remain off when you turn the camera off and back on. If you turned on the macro feature, that will turn off when you turn the camera off.6. Adjustment of some features -- like how the camera selects focusing area -- are annoyingly difficult to access7. The video compression format is MTS (MPEG-2 Transport Stream) is used. This format is used only by Sony and Panasonic, as I understand it. It will require an MTS converter.8. The Panasonic-provided software is Windows-only. (Come on guys, haven't you learned anything post-iPhone and iPad?)9. As I said, I have not tested the underwater qualities, but the seal around the door and the locking feature both look pretty feeble. I have used underwater housings professionally, and I can say that underwater is _very_ susceptible to user-error. A tiny bit of dust or a strand of hair in the seal can kill the underwater protection. Water wants to get in... and the deeper you go, the greater the pressure to force water in.10. And of course, this is a _very_ expensive point-and-shoot in today's market.Update (3 JUne 2011):I have had more time to work with the focusing issues on this camera, and my conclusion is that it is _terrible_ on focus -- slow and inaccurate. I rarely use point-and-shoot cameras. Most of the cameras I have used have been Canon (both professional DSLRs and point-and-shoots) and this is hands-down the worst camera I have yet seen for focusing. No matter how I adjust the settings (sports, facial recognition, landscape, portrait, etc.), it routinely fails to focus on the subject of interest.","May 16, 2011",0
cameras,"Good for many things, but not snorkeling - dead camera",Christopher Lee,R2A4DSBRJKU327,3,"I loved this camera for its durability in many environments, but bought it primarily for a trip to Kauai for taking pictures while snorkeling. I purchased the camera several months ahead of time to familiarize myself with it before the big trip. I found that the camera was quite good for a point & shoot, and liked its ability to absorb bumps, dirt, and splashes without worry.Then came time for our trip to Kauai. It survived its first challenge - a doors-off helicopter tour where the camera got high-velocity rain pelted at it. No leaks, great pictures, no worries. When the weather was good for fall snorkeling, I carefully cleaned and inspected the seal area (as per the instructions), closed, and locked the battery/memory card door. First snorkel was about 3 hours in total, broken into ~4 separate 30 minute sessions - no deeper than ~5 feet. When we got back to the rental, I did the specified freshwater rinse & dry. When I opened the door, there was a very scant amount of moisture - perhaps 1-2 drops on the inside of the door. It was a small enough amount that it looked like it could have been just water adherant to the seal. So on the second day, I thought it would be best to limit the underwater time. After an even more religious inspection of the door & seal, and cleaning any dust with a lenspen brush, I closed & locked the door. Unfortunately, about 2 minutes into the first trip into the water, the camera display started flickering. I immediately went to land, and was then faced with a conundrum. If water is leaking in, and there is saltwater in the electronics, the only hope is to get it out ASAP. Waiting to do the specified rinse, dry, wait would almost guarantee a failure, because time with the battery still connected would lead to irreversible damage. I decided the best thing to do was to do a quick rinse with my plain bottled water, dried it off as best I could with a towel, and then opened the door. There was clear saltwater intrusion. I popped the battery and SD cards out immediately, and tipped the camera door-down. Approximately 1 mL of liquid came out. There was clear corrosion on the cable connectors. I dried everything out as much as possible, and then continued snorkeling using my old iPhone 3gs in an Aqua Box to take videos (you can't use a capacitive touch screen underwater in salt water) as you could press the record button above water, and then record as you are underwater.When I got home, I opted against submitting a warranty repair, knowing Panasonic's track record on such things. I did a teardown to see what had failed and whether it could be salvaged. It appears that the door seal leaked despite my efforts, and the board which handles the battery input is located near the bottom of the case. It's clear that very little water entered the case, but with saltwater, 2 boards sustained significant electrolytic corrosion damage, and do not appear repairable.Lessons learned: I would not consider this a waterproof camera. This camera took little bumps in its pre-snorkel life, but no drops, so that should not have caused the leak. I followed the instructions, and still ended up with a dead camera.As a sidenote, I think these ""rugged"" ""waterproof"" compact cameras have a significant flaw regarding underwater use. There is no way to know whether there is water intrusion until it stops working. Admittedly, the cost of these is very attractive compared to the camera + waterproof case, where the cases often cost more (sometimes considerably more) than the camera. That being said, you can see leaks starting and bail out before irreparable damage occurs.I give this camera 5 stars for everything up to the tragic loss, 1 star for failure to maintain ""waterproofness"". Overall, not a bad camera, but I recommend using a case if you're going to use it underwater.","November 1, 2011",0
cameras,DETAILED COMPARISON OF Panasonic TS3 to Sony TX10,SammiMur,R2BLNOXW1O8IS7,3,"First, some background on what I was looking for: I'm a casual photographer. I wanted a waterproof camera which would produce high-quality photos in all settings (indoor, outdoor, and underwater. My intention was to completely replace my 7.2MP Sony DSC-W7, which I LOVE. I wanted to add the underwater feature without compromising on other features. I did not want to spend more than about $400 for everything (camera, two 8GB memory cards (Class 10), two extra batteries with charger, and float strap. This left me with about $340 max to spend on the camera itself. I do NOT know a lot about photography. Terms like ""ISO"" and ""white balance"" are foreign to me. I like to use pre-programmed scene modes and auto features. I enjoy digital scrapbooking and I frequently zoom and crop. It takes a very high quality photo to crop out/enlarge a small figure without too much distortion.I began my search online and spent about 6 hours researching the cameras in my price range. The cameras I focused on most were the Canon D10, Sony TX10, Panasonic TS3 (sometimes referred to as FT3), Olympus TG-810, Olympus Tough 8010, Fujifilm XP30, and Pentax WG-1.I eliminated most of these options rather quickly based on their reviews, overall ratings, and the quality of photos that I reviewed. I narrowed my focus to the Canon D10, the Sony TX10, and the Panasonic TS3.I wanted to love the Canon D10, since it seems to be the overwhelming fan favorite, but I ultimately decided that it wasn't going to be a good fit for me. The price of the D10 is similar to the Sony and the Panasonic, but it's a 2.5 year old model which doesn't have HD video. The photo quality seemed about equivalent to the other two, so I decided to only focus on the two models with HD video.I would have been completely sold on the Sony, since I've used only Sony cameras most of my adult life and I've never been disappointed in one; however, there were some notable deficiencies which most reviewers found with this model (detailed below), so I was a bit hesitant to take the plunge. The Sony was also priced near the top of my budget ($329), whereas the Panasonic was only $275 at Amazon.com. The Panasonic reviews seemed to all be very positive, with the only significantly commonly-noted problem being lower quality indoor photos. However, all of the indoor, outdoor, and underwater photos that I reviewed online looked very good.I decided to take a chance on the Panasonic TS3 and I really, really, wanted to fall in love with it. I ordered it from Amazon and they delivered it the next day. I wasn't blown away by this camera. The outdoor photos were good. The video was very good. The underwater photos (taken in my large fish tank) were very good. The indoor photos were POOR. I decided to order the Sony TX10, hoping that I'd see better results. I ordered it from Amazon at 9pm that night and it was delivered at 1:00pm the next day (gotta love Amazon!). The photo quality of the Sony camera is outstanding. I'll be keeping the Sony TX10!!! For some people, however, the Panasonic might be the better choice.First, I'll provide my overall recommendations, then I'll add in all of the detail:BUY THE SONY TX10 IF:You value the quality of the photos/video above all else.You like touch screen devices.You don't plan to dive lower than 16 feet.You don't care if you can't adjust your settings (other than zoom) underwater.You want a VERY small camera.You always use a wrist strap.BUY THE PANASONIC TS3 IF:You can live with grainy indoor photos.You don't typically enlarge your photos to 100% (because they will be distorted).You want a camera with GPS.You plan to dive deeper than 16 feet.You want a larger (but not too big) camera.You're looking for a less expensive option.NOW FOR MY DETAILED COMMENTS ON BOTH MODELS:PRICE - The Sony is +/- $50 more expensive than the Panasonic.SIZE - The Sony is significantly smaller and lighter than the Panasonic. I don't think one is better than the other, per se. It's a matter of personal preference. The Sony will fit in most pockets. The Panasonic probably wouldn't.RUGGEDNESS - Both cameras are rated very well in this area. I haven't ""tested"" them, but it seems like the Panasonic is built a bit tougher and would be less likely to get destroyed in a fall. Rather than test this feature, I'm going to just trust the experts that either one will hold up well if dropped.","August 20, 2011",0
cameras,Loved it until it leaked.,"MWP ""Prangley""",R2UTNYSWDO84KN,3,"I have owned this camera sense it hit the market in April. The screen in great, it is easy to see and read underwater.The picture quality it what you would expect from a camera of a lesser price. But you fork over extra for the GPS feature. This feature is often slow to update and can be very vague sometimes and extremely specific others (like when I was in a community center in the boonies).Flash is what you would expect from a point and shoot. Not poor, but I prefer to use my canon with an external flash when I really need some light, so that's not a big deal for me.I have not used the 3D feature.As my title states this little camera leaked on me last week when I was on vacation in Hawaii. It turned itself off and when I turned it back on it said ""this battery can not be used"" or something to the effect. I knew what had happened immediately. I took out the battery and memory card and left it open to dry for a couple of days. I have tried it sense and it seems to be dead. I will be calling Panasonic tomorrow.UPDATE: they tested it and confirmed it leaked. I got a new one. I really hope this one holds up.","August 18, 2011",0
cameras,Could've been good - but ...,Fred Dagg,R4G18QMVUELUX,3,"As a rugged camera this isn't too bad. It ticks all of the boxes for specifications and its relatively easy to use. It was unfortunate for me though that I gave it to some guy who took photos under water and must've mistakenly opened it. Anyway, Panasonic didn't want to know about it (quoting me US$184 to repair it), and 2 months after buying it I am now left with an expensive paper weight. Looks like the locking mechanism has some design issues. You be the judge - I'm going back to Olympus.","April 30, 2012",0
cameras,Great unless it gets in the water!!,Andrew & Blake's mommy,R1ZCKI6M18ZVDI,3,"We have had this camera for about 9 months. It takes beautiful pictures both insides and out. It is fairly easy to use and set up. It fits in my husband's pocket, which is a must when we travel. The screen is large and makes it easy to see the shot you are trying to get. It has also proven to be pretty shock resistant as it has been dropped several times and banged on walls - all by accident as we move through the day with luggage and a young child.Now, with all of the nice things said about this camera (I am not technical nor a photography expert so I cannot give specific details on more advanced features), this camera is NOT water proof. My husband has taken it kayaking, so it did get splashed on and it had no problems but either did our last non-waterproof camera with this activity. The problem happened last month when we decided to take it snorkeling. Well, it was in about 6 inches of water (since we were still getting positioned) and it took 3 pictures (which did survive) and it died - black screened on us. We thought okay, it needs to dry out and get some rest, as if it had a hard day and needed some time to reflect on how to go forward. Well, letting our little blue camera rest and dry out did not help it. It was utterly and totally dead!!We called the warranty department and got a very nice young lady to help us with the procedure on returning the camera for repairs. We sent the camera to them by priority mail and one week later the status online said that they had not received it. We called them again and they said it was there probably but they have a BACKLOG of this particular camera so they will get to it as soon as possible. This was a huge red flag for us and one that I wish would have been in bold letters on the product page!! :) The helpful people, which they were every time we contacted them, called us three days later and left a message saying that they could not repair the camera and they were sending us a replacement.Our camera got water in the lens, the flash, and the battery case - it smelled burnt and took two days for the lens to dry out. It was toast.I would have gladly given this camera 1 star but I feel as though since the company stood behind their product then they deserve my 3 star rating. With that said though, we will not use this camera in water again. I would not recommend this product for its intended use of being water proof/resistant and it is too expensive for a point and click camera since you can get the basic features on far less expensive models. There are plenty of people who have not had this difficulty but I would read through the reviews carefully before you decide to purchase this camera.","June 13, 2012",0
cameras,"Rugged, but picture quality is only so-so",tmann,R2HFN637WRBOGO,3,"I bought this to replace an older Canon digital camera, a PowerShot SD770IS (10 MP). That camera died as the result of moisture intrusion during our honeymoon, which sucked. Not wanting that to happen again, I sought out to buy a waterproof camera. At the time, this seemed to be the best option available. The camera does seem to be rugged and waterproof, so it was successful from that point of view.However, the picture quality of the camera is not very great. It is difficult to get crisp shots unless you are outdoors in bright light. Even then, when you review the pictures you shot, if you zoom in on any of them, they quickly get blurry. It's like even though it's 12.1 MP, it's really not much better than a 3 MP camera, because you can't zoom in to take advantage of the quality anyways. Indoor/low light performance of this camera is terrible.This camera was a letdown, but we ended up keeping it for vacations and wet use anyways. For normal shooting, we wanted something better, so we bought a newer model (at the time) Canon, the SX230HS. That camera is awesome - the shot quality and low light performance is really good.I also generally like Canon's menus and UI much better. I found the DMC-TS3's menus to be a little confusing and ""clunky"".","February 23, 2014",0

cameras,"Decent camera, broke after being underwater",Rajo,R31AYP1PJ391SK,3,"I have owned this camera for about two years. During this time, it took great pictures above water and underwater (e.g., pool). I have been happy with performance. Recently, it was dropped onto the beach when getting out of a kayak. At that time, water got into the camera and it no longer turns on. My theory is that the water seal rings deteriorated over time.So, be careful putting it underwater after you've had it for a while. Given the price I paid for it, I am disappointed that it broke.","August 14, 2013",0
cameras,Main reason to get it was for the GPS signature,Josip Juraj Strossmayer,R1T90U7WYRXMHV,3,"... And that is the feature which seldom works. (Under open skies, I should add.) While the camera was under warranty, I called about the inability to lock onto satellites. They recommended complete factory reset, which somehow works, but not always and of course, all the various settings made and already forgotten about, ale lost. It certainly is a good camera for taking pictures, but since I did get it because of the GPS and that is disappointing, I cannot rate it very high.","July 10, 2013",0
cameras,Great until it goes wrong...,Mike C,R20K1DLYFGF7KS,3,"I wanted a camera that I could take snorkeling, and would give me images of at least the same quality as my Lumix TZ1 (which I still love.) Trusting the brand, this model seemed to fit the bill perfectly. Its feature list was best in class, and claimed waterproof depth was significantly higher. The optical zoom was a little less than best in class, but not much.I had this camera for 15 months and used it underwater about 15 times, taking around 1200 photos while snorkeling, sailing and kayaking. Almost all of the photos were taken within 6ft depth. I was generally happy with most of the raw photos it took, and very pleased with how they looked after editing in Lightroom. Limitations I found were with focusing - a lot of pictures were slightly off when I zoomed in; and dynamic range - a tendency for bleaching out the bright areas. Performance on land was OK but nothing special. I think the TZ1 trumps it for low light every time.The GPS feature is, frankly, a waste of money. Not very accurate when it does work, which is sporadically.The movie quality is ok, but the sound is awful.And now the real con to this camera: reliability. The first week I had it, I lost all of my photos because it corrupted the memory card. And yes, the card was fine and functional before I used it in this camera.Now if you're reading this review before buying this model or its successor with the same basic body design: beware. I also came across many reviews complaining of the waterproof seal failing and killing the camera, and was inclined to think they had just not cleaned the seal or something. Not so. I used this camera twice at 12ft and both times it leaked. The first time was without incident, but the second was fatal. And of course, it's 3 months out of warranty... This time I think I'm going with a Pentax.","May 21, 2013",0

cameras,Great underwater pics but did not last,"C. Hernandez ""Vinyl Reborn""",R2ESDN0OSPN3ZE,3,"I bought this camera when it first came out specifically for underwater use at the great barrier reef. It worked very well and feel the pics and video underwater was better than expected. The shots were clear and got pics of nemo and great memories. It also took decent pictures during daylight but less than average quality at night. After the Australia trip, I only used the camera above water and sporadically light. Last month, I traveled to the tropics and took the camera to the beach. To my surprise water got inside the camera and it shut down for good. I think the camera lid may not have snapped in all the way but it appeared to be closed with the extra security switch. Either that or the seal failed. In hindsight, the locking mechanism is a serious flaw on this camera. I really love the ability to take pictures underwater, so picked up a good deal on the equivalent Nikon camera (AW100). I quickly noted that the locking mechanism on the Nikon is far superior and full proof relative to the Panasonic. While I have not tested the Nikon underwater, I did get it wet and encountered no problems. But I can tell you that above water it is far superior in picture quality and particularly using the scene settings. It also does great at night, where the Panasonic did a poor job. At any rate, while the Ts3 now is an old and replaced camera, i think the locking mechanism of the latest model has not changed. I would not purchased this product again from Panasonic.","March 6, 2013",0

cameras,Overpriced For Mediocre Photos - Waterproof?,"Lard Helmet ""weephole""",R3J42D8K7MDE2C,3,"Bought this camera early last summer in anticipation of a trip to Maui, which would include a lot of snorkeling. There were very few reviews at the time so I purchased the camera mostly on faith.I recieved it just prior to our departure,and used it extensively on land and in the water.By the end of the trip , the camera was no longer functioning - black screen - even though I had followed all of the immersion and post immersion procedures to a T.Upon returning home, I had to send it to Texas for repairs and didn't see it again for 3 months.While the camera was working, I took underwater vids, and still photos, on land and in the water. In my opinion, the photos were very good in bright sunlight, and mediocre to poor indoors, or in any kind of low lighting. The underwater videos were good as long as there was ample sunlight and we weren't too deep.Compared to the Sony Bloggie that one of our travel partner's brought along, the land videos weren't in the same league - the bloggie took much more vivid videos with less lense flare, and other weird abberations that the Lumix experienced, depending on the angle of the sun.All in all,I am very disappointed with the camera. I have an old Fuji finepix 3.5 megapixel camera and a Canon A630 8MP that take much better pictures, and land videos than the lumix. The only thing that I can recommend about the Lumixis underwater, or rugged photos/video if you don't mind settling for mediocre shots in most conditions.Also, the waterproof design could be flawed, as mine malfunctiond after a few days of underwater use.","June 13, 2012",0

No questions asked.Even though reviews for this new model indicate it has the same issue, I can hold no grudge with Panasonic's customer service as they promptly exchanged the camera.It's still bad that I paid $250 on a camera that I will be forced to use like much cheaper models, but well, it happens.I am changing my review to 3 stars to make justice to their customer service.","November 2, 2012",0
cameras,"Buy For Durability, Not Photo Quality",T. Patrick,R1BR9W3PXPV9U0,3,"Good size, shape; feels good in hand. Does survive 5 foot falls--we had a toddler and so the camera has taken a few spills already :( .Photo quality is poor given the price. Our four-year old, $149 camera takes pictures that are much sharper with more accurate color. The TS3 cannot deal with even moderate dynamic range in a shot--darker areas are noisy. If the shot is dim overall, the entire image will be rather noisy. And all fine details, regardless of light intensity, such as blades of grass, distant tree leaves, even the striped pattern of bluejeans, get blurred into a patch of solid color. It is amazing that a $300 camera gets away with this!GPS is impressive if you wait long enough for it to determine the location. On our 18 day trip, the GPS rarely located us since we only had the GPS on when the camera was on. We did leave the GPS on full-time one day, which was a huge mistake because the battery was dead before lunch.

cameras,"Good camera, but doesn't include all accessories as promised",GHL,R14JMI1HW0T90W,3,"I bought this camera for my wife since I already have a TS2 and we love it. When we were reading about it, Panasonic's website listed the silicone cover (like the TS2 has) as an included item. When I received it....no cover. I went back to Panasonic's site, and now they have removed it. Googling for info found a bunch of other unhappy customers who encountered the same situation - it turns out Panasonic stopped including the silicon cover for the US version of the camera but did not inform anyone or change their website prior to making this decision. Without the cover, the camera body, LCD and lens are easily scratched especially in a beach environment with rocks and sand. I really like the camera, but feel Panasonic needs to take a beating for this -- it's completely unacceptable to advertise one thing then quietly change your website and try to get out of it. Really -- if I had time and energy on my hands I would pursue a class action claim to make them give us our covers as advertised. Very unhappy with Panasonic, though the camera itself is great.","August 18, 2011",0

cameras,"Great camera, a couple quirks though",San Diego Buyer,R2XX3Z8J2JENN0,3,"I had the D60 for almost 3 years, which was an excellent camera, but my skills reached the camera's limitations rather quickly. I had to upgrade.I was torn between the D3100 and the D5100 - the D7000 was outside my price range :( . I chose the D5100 since it uses the same 16 MP sensor as the fantastic D7000. These things addressed are mostly stuff that wasn't on the D60Pros1. Great image resolution - you will not get better image quality from any similar priced camera. The colorization engine inside the processor is excellent - it seems to preserve sharpness, and you can choose the sharpness in camera.2. Exposure Bracketing - this is one thing that the D60 didn't have that I was really missing out on.3. In-camera RAW processing. This is super handy. I don't wanna have to turn on the ol' computer and open my hacked copy of CS5 every time. The ViewNX software is atrocios since it tuns its own sharpening routine automatically which accents any grain. (i could go on and on about the ViewNX but it's free so i can't complain too much)4. D-lighting is somewhat useful for jpeg output.5. White balance settings are modifiable.6. LCD is reticulating. Yes this is kinda gimicky, but it does have its usefulness once in a while.7. Live view mode - and it has face recognition! (see cons 1 below)8. HD video - while i do not use this much, it is nice to have.9. Quiet shutter mode - this means the shutter mirror return happens AFTER you release the shutter button. The camera only make one click when you take a picture. You don't get the typical snap-snap that SLR's are known for.10. AUto-ISO mode allow minumum shutter speed setting (very nice)Cons1. Shooting in live view mode is really cumbersome - there is noticeable lag from shutter press to activation. This is not typically a problem, but if you are tightly composing your shot it'll be an issue since the hand shake may move the image lightly in that half-second timeframe before it actually captures the photo.2. Flash sync speed only down to 1/200 seconds? BOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO. MINUS one star for that3. Auto-ISO seems to ignore the fact that you are using the flash - this means that in a dark room, if you take a picture with the flash, you will get an extremely grainy image since the camera used an ISO rating that you would use WITHOUT the flash. MINUS one star for this.4. Battery life seems noticeably less for this generation.","December 19, 2012",0

I now have a functioning camera, but can't rate it higher due to the poor technical service.Update 11/11/11: Nikon returned the camera, stating that the camera met specs and that my SanDisk memory card was defective. Of course I had checked the memory card in another D5100 before returning my camera, and it was ok. Nevertheless, I bought a new San Disk card, tried the camera, and experienced the same issue. I called Nikon and returned the camera for warranty service once again, at their expense this time.I look forward to enjoying my new, highly rated D5100 - once Nikon returns it to me after warranty repair. It was defective out of the box. It would take a photo or two, then fail to recognize the memory card. I would have to turn the camera off, remove and replace the memory card, and then be good for a few more photos before it failed again. Nikon has the camera and seems to be in no hurry to return it.

cameras,Decent Camera with Warts,Thomas J Lynch,RZSOOQ9ROCLE6,3,"First of all, this camera takes very good pictures, which is the main reason I bought it. Given the price, 5 STARS for image quality, features and convenience of use.Second, I got the body (no kit lenses, which seem to have pretty mediocre ratings from users), along with the Nikon 35mm f/1.8G AF-S DX (5+ STARS) and the Nikon 55-300mm f/4.5-5.6G ED VR AF-S DX (4+ STARS for athletic events). I later added a AF-S DX NIKKOR 10-24mm f/3.5-4.5G ED (5+ STARS) and the 16-85mm f/3.5-5.6 ED VR (4 STARS, but a great snapshot lens).So far so good. Why only 3 STARS? Here's what I don't like.Autofocus hunts a lot sometimes, especially in marginal light. It doesn't seem to matter what lens is on the camera, so I assume it's the body. It's not a problem most of the time, but occasionally you can lose a shot because the camera is trying to figure out what to look at.The video feature, while not at all my priority, is pretty primitive as far as settings go. The major problem, however, is autofocus again, which can suddenly in the middle of a video start radically seeking focus, moving way in and out before settling back down. Occasionally, the camera will lose focus altogether. Manual focus works best, but is not always practical. Setting the camera's focus on the center point also works a little better, but the camera keeps wanting to shift to some other point in the frame and you have to keep resetting it (I haven't been able to figure out how to defeat this tendency).My last point of dissatisfaction emerged this weekend and may be the most serious. After a week's uneventful shooting, I downloaded the images, cleared the card, changes lenses and charged the battery. When I turned the camera back on, it gave the dreaded ""Error press shutter release button again"" message, which apparently is no rare experience for this or a number of other Nikon cameras. Of course, pressing the shutter release button again accomplishes nothing. After losing a weekend's use of the camera, I was all ready to ship it back to Nikon when I stumbled on a forum post, [...] (scroll down until you come to ""Rico"" and be sure to look at his subsequent posts). CAUTION: there are many reasons for this error, not all of which can be solved by the solution offered in this post, and there are some other DIY solutions out there that seem absolutely nutty to me. To cut to the chase, my problem was my mirror had jammed in the down position against what is supposed to be a stop. Some gentle prying (not for the faint of heart) freed the mirror and the camera has been working since. This design or engineering flaw has really left a bad impression.So 5 STARS for image quality and basic functionality, less one star for autofocus difficulties (especially video) and less one big star for design and reliability.I'm probably being generous.","December 8, 2013",0
cameras,"Great beginner, some intermediate use DSLR - not more though",T. F,R2JW1V79VPSQHI,3,"I had this camera for about a year and got to know it very well. I had upgraded from a D60.The camera's main selling point - compared to the d3100 - was its 16 megapixel sensor which the d7000 also has. Unfortunately, the lack of all the other cool bells and whistles that the d7000 has (see below) leaves the d5100 in an identity crisis. Other minor gimmicky things are bracketing, in camera HDR, better lcd with swivel.To be perfectly honest, all these things I have found to be not incredibly useful for real world applications.Bracketing:Okay, you're in a studio, crunched for time, the editor of a magazine is on your back for the pictures for their next month's cover. You don't have time to get exact lighting levels, so you just set to bracket and viola. Sure, that's a great use for it. unfortunately, no buyer of a d5100 will be doing this. If you are doing this you will have a much more expensive camera. For the average person, the bracketing only fills up your memory card 3x faster. It is absolutely useless for anything other than posed shots, which is probably a very small segment of who would actually be buying this camera.HDR:I used this about twice in the year I owned it, and to be honest I forgot which pictures i did with it. You can't do it on a moving subject. Same situation as bracketing; only posed shots or architecture. Very seldom a use case for someone buying a sub-1000 dollar camera.Swivel LCD:Ultra gimicky. How often does anyone really need this? The ONLY time i used this was self-portrait. that's it.My other miscellaneous gripes:1. The LCD seems to get dust inside it very easily. After a year (just sold it here) there were noticeable spots of dust under the LCD on the lower right side.2. Inferior autofocus sensor seems to have trouble getting anything but kit lenses in focus consistently. This is the main reason I sold it. AF just wasn't reliable. I heard the same with the D7000. You would think after 50 years of making cameras, Nikon would be able to know how to autofocus...3. My LCD had a dead pixel. How did this get past quality control?4. No noticeable difference between Fine and Normal quality jpegs. Fine are like twice the size though.NOTE: There is NO internal AF motor, so you are barred from using any of the non G lenses. This may not be an issue for most people, but I had a couple older D style lenses, and i couldn't use them. Also, no commander mode for external flashes. I realize these two things would make it more expensive, so that's why they didn't add them.Conclusion:If you are thinking of getting this camera, my advice is to seriously consider the d3100 (now d3200) instead, as that does 90% of what this one does and is a couple hundred $$ cheaper. If you are looking to take pictures of family/friends and want to step into the world of DSLR as a beginner, go with the d3100. Honestly, the extra few megapixels is not significant.If you are getting more serious about photography and want to start using primes or external flashes, you will need to get the d7000/d7100.If you know something about photography, you will outgrow this camera very quickly and my advice is just cut to the chase and buy the higher model. you won't be disappointed.","April 10, 2013",0

cameras,Nikon D5100 Softness Issues,"Angel_Pen ""angel_rising""",R33CDV60DC4E6M,3,"A professional photographer quick-review: I tried different lenses on the D5100 camera: the kit lens (low quality), some old 35mm Nikon prime lenses and the high quality Wide Angle 10.5mm. Results: the old prime lenses gave the sharpest results as usual but none of the Nikon lenses I tested came even close to matching the ultra high resolution I got from the Canon Rebel T3i with the included kit lens. Other than the softness, this is a great camera for low light situations.I don't know why this camera is softer than the Canon but I am not the only one experiencing this issue, you may compare both cameras using the ""Comparometer"" online which clearly confirms my findings. I am guessing the T3i Rebel has a better sensor than the Nikon and that is a real pity because I would have preferred to use Nikon. The good news is that the D5100 performs far better than the Canon in low light conditions.By the way, the 1080p video test I shot was unusable, the D5100 does not have anything close to the kind of optical stabilization required for video production and I am not going to carry a tripod when I can use my Canon HV20 camcorder instead without any trouble, it just would not be practical.Despite all these shortcomings, I still would recommend the D5100 for telephoto and low-light still photos (such as wedding photography).Update: After further research it turns out that all Nikon DLSRs in this price range are famous for producing soft images which require sharpening in post. Indeed, I looked at my D60 photos and they are also soft. However, there are rumors that Nikon has plans to switch to a different type of sensor to keep up with the competition. So, maybe before 2012 Nikon will bring good news for all Nikon fans, that is, if the world does not end in 2012.","June 7, 2011",0

This is very unfortunate as Canon allows full manual control of video and as I understand it, the soon-to-be-released Nikon D3200 will have full manual control for video. It's not that Nikon couldn't give us full manual control, it's that Nikon chose not to. I wish a firmware update would fix this issue, but considering the absolutely lousy service I have received lately from Nikon, I doubt the company will provide a firmware fix because Nikon does not seem to care about it's customers.","May 14, 2012",0

The quality of the pictures was okay but I finally realized this camera is just underpowered for my needs (can't really think anybody but total amateur could be happy with it). The live shooting mode is next to useless because of how long it takes to focus and how unreliable the focus is int this mode (this is still a huge issue for most DSLRs). Was happy to advance to a D600, although even this camera could use the more advanced autofocus of the D800 ie 51 points instead of the 39 points it has (silly of Nikon to have purposefully undermined its functionality that way).

cameras,Nice but for whom?,"Zan ""Zan""",R3MFW0G5WCVD75,3,"In terms of sensor and picture quality, I have nothing to complain. An excellent camera from that point of view. As people have spoken enough about the good side, I would like to mention some thing that I do not like.Following the market trend, the D5100 is trying to load a lot of things into the camera. The manufacturer is focusing too much on marketing strategies and forgot that simplicity is also important and welcome. A classic example: the aperture priority and speed priority. These are actually the same thing, and one of them is redundant. But now even more unnecessary options are packed into a small machine and only few of them are truly needed. The pixel size racing is also becoming ridiculous. For that type of camera, 10MP is good enough. More is not positive anymore. If people do want to make huge prints, they should go with full-frame or medium format cameras. Many of the in-camera photo treatment options are also unnecessary or even childish. Serious photo editing should be taken care of by computer software as the small camera screen will make the job rough anyway. I wish more efforts are made for dynamic range improvement (D5100 did well in this aspect) and cost reduction (this can be improved). It does not make much sense to spend $900 (current street price) for something plastic that will become obsolete in 2 to 3 years.The D5100 is supposed to be a premier entry level camera. ""Premier entry level"" is actually a bad idea (it is almost an oxymoron in reality). For those who do not know how to take good pictures, the extra cost will not help them improve picture quality much, as they may not even fully utilize the capacity of the lower entry level cameras while they are less expensive. For those who are serious about photography, a lot of features are either trivial (e.g., scene selection, live view, in-camera editing, etc.), or not good enough (e.g., movie). If they are serious, even if they are not good now, they will be determined to learn how to manipulate exposures instead of relying on things like scene selections. For some people, the D5100 offers high ISO for dark objects, but it will be wiser to spend the extra money on a good lens, e.g., the 50mm/f1.8D, 50mm/f1.8G, or 35mm/f1.8G. These fast lens will help in low lighting situations and produce better pictures, and they will not become obsolete in 20 years. In addition, filters also help in many ways to expand the capabilities of the camera. In my opinion, the D5100 should be modified in one of the following two directions:1. For those who are serious about photography and do not have the budget for D7000, the D5100 could offer them a less expensive model with same sensor quality but even lower price (by minimizing the unimportant features), or the current price but more functions/features for professionals instead of those for populace.2. For those who do not intend to learn photography, the D3100 is good enough as it also has the live view, video option, and improved high ISO. They do not need the D5100 (except they have no other place to spend the additional $200). If they do need an upgrade, then auto HDR and high resolution screen in D5100 can be good additions, but these should be enough. The price difference could be within $50-100, not $200 (by dropping other ""improvements"").Here comes a question of how to segment customers. The current popular categories of 'beginners' and 'enthusiasts"" are misleading. A more useful segmentation should be enthusiasts or not, i.e., those who want to learn photography and those who do not, and all the features and functions should be designed and packaged in these two directions. But today, things are mixed in one direction (for entry level cameras), the distinctions are mostly a matter of degrees, i.e., more or less features, not different types of features.By the way, I also would like to talk about the appearance design. The D5100 is elegant, but not as good as D40 and D3000 (in appearance). Nikon made one of the D5100 body's corners round (lower-right side viewing from front). That part does not match the the overall sleek looking. The childish treatment makes that part look silly and the entire body fatty. Another design issue: Viewing from the right side, the gap between the display panel and the camera body is unnecessarily too wide. I think a tight fit will make it look more robust and elegant. Forgive me for being fastidious, but appearance is as important to me as functions and quality. And appearance promotes sale (think about Apple's gracious designs).Overall, the D5100 is a good camera, but it is not the best in combination of features and price: both enthusiast and non-enthusiasts will pay for many features they do not need, in different ways. The problem is camera manufacturers are trying to blend different needs instead of separating them in the entry level DSLR section.","July 8, 2011",0
cameras,Fine camera - missing key features,Julie,R3NIKX6EFAVDES,3,"I bought this camera as an upgrade from my (still awesome) Nikon D50. Overall the camera is just what I would expect, an incremental improvement over my 6-year old body. However I do have a couple of very critical marks for it:1. Nikon removed the AF servo. Now all of my ""AF"" lenses are ""MF"". Shame on me for buying it, but the next body up with modern features and the AF servo is $550 more and I don't know that Nikon will keep the AF servo in for the next generation. This leads me to believe I should be investing in new glass.2. Extremely cramped body grip. My hand is cramping up holding the grip as they have removed the extremely useful mini-lcd on the top. This means my hand wraps around too far and it is hard to hold on to the camera. The body is also not as tall as it used to be, again making it hard to grip. I have larger than average hands, but the D50's grip is why I went Nikon over Canon 6 years ago.3. Lack of mini-lcd on the top.

With all the scene modes and options on the camera why can't Nikon (the experts in color) get this right?

Amazon did then credit my Amex the $104, but classified it a ""good will refund"". We reordered the D5100 and this one seems to be working fine. Will update when the camera has seen some use - hopefully can then give a review on the camera.","September 29, 2011",0
cameras,Really Not impressive,Devi,R2475J68PK595S,3,"I had Nikon d40, a starter camera, the picture quality was amazing. After 5 years of use, I sold it just to buy this camera. This camera is definitely loaded with features. Much more pixels and bigger sensor, VR lens. But if you compare with Nikon d40 picture quality of this camera is not even close. I already started missing my d40. Stuck with this new toy. I had about 15 years of slr experience. This is my 4th slr and 2nd dsl. Ok to buy, if it is your first one.

cameras,Not as good as the 3100,"Catherine M. Smith ""Marie""",R28MMPFSA9WT2V,3,"Thanks to a bad crash against pavement in the church parking lot last summer, the casing on my D3100 cracked just above the circular button used to adjust the manual settings (I am a newbie at photography and can't recall the name of that part of the camera). Since I am a storm chaser and love to photograph lightning, I have to be able to use the manual functions. I debated as to whether to get another 3100 or a 7000 series. I thought the former would soon be obsolete, and the latter was beyond what I can afford at the moment, given I just bought a $1000 lens and am still not sure if photography is my thing. So I opted for the 5100.When i bought my 3100, the 5100 was also on the market and I read mixed reviews. I cannot really appreciate any bonuses this camera has over the 3100. Actually, I am trying to imagine how the 5100's image display is going to work out on the Plains. I am not sure I like the fact that it sticks out, away from the body of the camera, and that so many of the camera's functions are located there. I am afraid if I leave it on the tripod (which you must do for lightning shots), it will be more susceptible to gusts of wind and breakage.On the other hand, it has a few cool features buried in its ""effects"" that the 3100 did not have. Overall though, i am not convinced it's a better deal.","April 25, 2013",0
cameras,Get D7000 instead,hunter1,R2IGJOVBMCUNTZ,3,"Buyers may become tempted with the specifications and low price of this camera. Specially I noticed that the flip-out LCD screen is a big deal among novice photographers who want to upgrade from a point and shoot to DSLR... Yes, it has D7000 sensor on it and image quality is better than almost any entry and mid-lvele DSLR on the market (except Nikon D7000 and Sony A77 which share the identical sensor) but this great image quality at this low price comes at a price BUILD QUALITY1. Camera is not weather sealed, means you may not use it outside even in drizzle. You may say it can sustain the drizzle. Internal parts may sustain but chances to ruin the flip-out LCD screen are high. overall if you want to use a camera outside or while travel, this camera is not your best choice.2. Camera has full plastic body and it may be damaged permanently with a single drop. It's DSLR camera, it's not as tough as your everyday point and shoot, even dropping it on a soft surface may permanently damage the internal parts.3. No internal focus motor means you may not use so many used but awesome older Nikon lenses. This may not be a big deal for you as you read this review but I promise that it'll be within the next 2 weeks! Imagine there is a ""Made in Japan"" used prime lens on Ebay which worth 1000, it's for sale for 150, you want it by your heart but can't buy it because cant use it! It's a big deal. don't underestimate this.4. Camera body is so small. It doesn't give you the feel of a real DSLR, more like an oversize compact.5. Cheap internal parts. This is a real issue. It may stop working after 6 months. well, that's not bad because Nikon takes care of the issue under warranty. but imagine it stops working at day 367! That's a real disaster and it may happen because the internal parts are of lower quality than more expensive DSLRs.Now the conclusion. CHEAP IS THE MOST EXPENSIVE. If you are tight on budget, buy D7000. if you are not tight on budget, still buy D7000. D7000 body is twice as expensive as this camera with kit lens but absolutely worth the price.","June 27, 2012",0

The colors produced by this camera are horrible with terrible skin tones and strange color shifts. The OOC images are very soft. High ISO noise handling is excellent as long as you shoot JPEG.

cameras,Depends on your needs,amolba,R3468JY8SUE19Z,3,"I wanted to love this camera as a step up from my Nikon D80, but this did not fill the bill. I will start by saying I love my Nikon D80, but I will never claim it is nearly as sharp as Canon. My husband has a Canon xsi and T2i and my daughter has the T2i. All 3 are stellar cameras and the sharpness would be hard to beat. I prefer the color balance in the Nikon, and had hoped to improve the sharpness issues with this camera and the 18-200 VR lens. Didn't happen. So here is my opinion.PROS:* Does great at high ISO. Took photos at 1600 with no visible noise.* Video feature.CONS:* I personally found the LV button to be an annoying placement which was easy to hit inadvertently. A button on the back would have been preferred.* The sharpness just wasn't much of an improvement to justify the hefty price for the combo.* I love the moveable focus box in the D80 viewfinder. I do NOT like red focus lights. They do not show well against some backgrounds or in high light. I found no option to these.* The camera uses a non-standard USB connector which means if you have multiple cameras, you will need to use separate cords for this one.Bottom line: If you want super sharp photos, buy a Canon. If you want to upgrade your Nikon for video and low-light situations, this may work for you. It was not enough of an upgrade to justify the expense for me and is being returned.","August 6, 2011",0
cameras,Bad video quality,Disappointed20,R3B260P3CTXBWA,3,"Thought, the picture quality is good and it is a fast camera the video quality is very poor. It suffers from jitter, the video is not continuous and very unpleasant to watch. My $200 camera takes better movies.The lens that comes with the camera feels very cheap and when you zoom in or out, making videos, the movement is not smooth making the camera to move, creating even worse videos.I though it was just my camera, so I tried another one and found the same problem.I am completely disappointed with this camera for the price.","March 20, 2012",0

cameras,"Great photos, great video, somewhat difficult to use.",Robert Cozzi,R37QO4I4DH4UZI,3,"I tend to replace my point-n-shoot about every 3 years. I normally shoot a Nikon D90 but last year upgraded to a D7000.[UPDATE Feb 2012] The original camera was replaced by Nikon since it failed on the 2nd use in water. This one worked through our Caribbean holiday for 4 full days before it started overheating and would not shut off. It stayed on until the battery drained. Leaving it ""sit overnight"" and then removing and recharging the battery got it working again, however I could feel the heat the longer it was in use.The disappointing thing is this camera takes such great photos and now that we got it to work underwater, we know it takes fairly good underwater photos and video. But there's something wrong with either its design or the manufactured batch that we received. Had it too long to return to Amazon for a refund, so I'm probably going to send it a 2nd time back to Nikon. Note their repair service is great, but you have to be proactive and follow up or your repair/replacement will just sit there until you call them and ask for a status update. Once I did that after two weeks of hearing nothing and no status changes they said they'd check and the replacement was shipped out the next day.[/end-update]I took it to the Bahamas in order to test out the underwater capabilities. I also took along the D90 for ""good"" photos. After some fumbling with the crappy menu system, (its just me) I found that the AW100 photos were at least as good as the D90. The default color settings were wonderful. The video was better than expected above water, and much better than the Kodak PlaySport below water. The still photos (above water) were so good in fact, that I left the D90 in the hotel room safe for the rest of the trip.It has a 16Megapixel sensor that is back-wired. This moves the connections to the rear of the sensor which supposedly gives less noise and lower-light sensitivity. My testing at night showed this to be true for me.The bad things about it: The buttons are VERY touchy, the ""use it in the snow with big gloves on"" feature is a bit goofy, but then I haven't used it in the snow.The battery life is no where near as good a any CANON point and shoot I've owned, but with the GPS off it was acceptable.Speaking of the GPS, what a cool features. Not only do you geo-tag your photos, after you take a picture, it shows you the POI (point of interest) aka, the name of your location right on the screen. Not sure how that translates into the photo's meta data yet, but hopeful it will.All-in-all I really don't care for the menu structure which is rather limited and requires that you be in a specific MODE in order to change a setting. This is just silly IMHO.But the photo and video quality is about the best I've seen to date. So if you're looking for a simply camera, keep looking, but if you're reasonably comfortable fumbling with context menus, this may be the best imaging camera on the market today.[UPDATE]People are asking why ""3 stars""? Because the controls are VERY touchy. While the camera image quality is beyond what I would ever have expected, the controls are difficult to use because they are so sensitive. Making use annoying.WATER PROOFING FAILED: On my second trip to the Bahamas with the camera this month, it failed as soon as I hit the water. It was working fine for the two months that I've owned it, and was even working on the Beach. But then when I went into the water, it worked for a few minutes and then DEAD... Since it is more than 30 days old, I am sending to Nikon Service for repairs. If it comes back fine, I won't post again, but it something happens, I'll update this review again. With the U.S. holiday coming up and the timing of it being returned, I really don't expect to see it for at least 3 weeks.","October 16, 2011",0
cameras,Steps to turn GPS on Nikon Coolpix AW100,"Home Movie Buff ""Riptide360""",R3CDE7985FY0HN,3,"Picked this camera up at the Maui Costco for a family snorkeling vacation on the way to the beach from the airport. This camera replaced my aging Sony T7 and it's water proof case. I liked that it had built in GPS and that I wouldn't need to use my Eye-Fi card to add geo-tags to my photos.Much to my dismay the quick reference guide makes no mention of how to turn on the GPS (off by default). It only refers to the reference manual on CD (who carries a laptop with CD drive when travelling anymore?). I finally found it here on page 85:[...]Here are the steps for anyone googling how to turn on GPS on their Nikon CoolPix AW100:- turn on your AW100 camera (push the small rectangle button at top of camera)- push the GPS/Action large rectangle button on the left side of the camera (screen should show a world map)- push the MENU rocker button on the lower right corner of the camera (bottom right from the screen)- you should see the choice for GPS options. Use the OK button to turn it on (off by default).- you can then turn on ""Record GPS data"" to add the GPS data coordinates to your JPEG images.- while you are here you should also have your camera sync time/date stamp with the GPS satelitte (you have do to this everytime you change time zones).Important note: The GPS data is added to your JPEG image file as EXIF data (date photo taken, camera model, camera settings, etc) so if you post these photos online the GPS data can be revealed - something to be careful of when posting photos publicly from places you may not want people to know about (like your home's location).Now when you press the GPS button on the side of the camera you will see markers wherever the photos have been taken. This setting only works for new photos you take, it can't be added retroactively to previously taken photos. GPS data is only stored on photos where the camera was actually able to see 3 or more satellites. All of my underwater photos did NOT have GPS info added to them, so be sure to take a few surface shots to get your location recorded for future reference (ie favorite dive spot).I've posted a few snorkeling photos so you can see the image quality underwater as well as read the GPS info from where the above water boat photo was taken in Maui.Couple of notes on product improvements: Although the strap says it is to be removed for use in water it holds up fine. Make sure you soak camera for 10 minutes in fresh water after use in the ocean to remove the corrosive ability of salt water. Would be nice if Nikon included a float with the camera or at least a bright colored water proof strap so you can find it after it sinks to the ocean bottom. be sure to move camera slowly in water and never spray water on the camera - both cause increased water pressure which can exceed the 10m pressure it was designed to resist.Software like Apple iPhoto and Google Picasa can display your JPEG GPS info along with the image. If this review helped you setup your GPS please vote for it to help others find it.","December 6, 2011",0
cameras,Devil is in the Details with this Camera,Gale,R35567ODWS0GJ,3,"I really wanted to love this camera, but in the end I returned it. It has some outstanding ideas and some nice features but in the end it lacked too many essential features to stay in my backpack. The objective of my review is to share some things about this camera you won't read in any other reviews.Overall:* Problematic power supply: USB charging not supported. It must be charged using the supplied charger, which must be plugged into the wall. This brings up a related problem. It markets itself as an adventure camera and claims to be freeze proof yet it has lithium ion batteries, which drain like crazy when they get cold. The product manual even acknowledges this and recommends keeping the camera warm and in a pocket close to the skin. I took it skiing at Alta ski area on a day that was about 15 degrees. I kept it in my pocket and it was fine all day. However, I'm worried about what happens on multiday backcountry trips. How do I keep it charged? If I have an extra battery and it isn't in my pocket all day and night it is likely to drain. I can't take the charger unless I get the big huge GoPro solar panels with an inverter. Since it doesn't support USB charging I can't get a cheap AA battery pack that functions as a charger. In my opinion this is not a good multi-day camera due to the power supply.* Controls feel ""Trinkety"". The controls are plastic and feel like they were made from dime store plastic. It kind of makes the camera feel cheap. They do function OK.* Clunky controls and menus. The more you dive into the features and settings the more ridiculous it becomes. I'm the type of person who uses the controls and menus on a camera and I'd give the person who designed the menus and controls a C- grade. I guess they work, but for example it takes 3 clicks to delete a photo.* Boots up quickly. This is good because it is ready for action quickly. It's also good because there is no way to keep the camera ""on"" and have the display off.* Picture Review There is a mode to display the picture instantly after you take the shot but it only stays on the screen for like a second. On other cameras I liked the ability to select a longer auto display after the shot.* A class 6 SD memory card is recommended because you are recording HD movie. You'll probably want a 4GB or bigger card. Nikon only recommends SanDisk, Lexar, Panasonic and one other brand I'm forgetting.* The lens itself is covered by a piece of glass. The manual says it is possible that the internal glass surface might fog. They say ""this is not a defect"". The remedy they give is to go back to a place with a stable temperature, open the side door and see if it clears up. How am I supposed to do that in the backcountry? Fogging and condensation in the backcountry is due to extremes in temperature and moisture. I did not experience this when using the camera. I guess it is a pro and a con. It is easy to wipe off, but you are shooting through an additional surface which can pick up glare.* The camera is lightweight and compact* The action control navigation feature might actually be nice when you are wearing bulky gloves. I found it a little weird* Great Under water mode. I thought this might be its best feature. I was surprised at the quality of the photos and video it took under water. It might be cool to get the camera in the water as your buddy is reeling in a big fish on his fly rod. I took lots of pictures in rivers and tidepools and the ocean and it worked well. You can take it to 33 feet depth. I wish it were rated to go to double that for scuba diving.* Shock Resistant: I really like the idea that it is shock resistant. In the back country I tend to be hard on cameras. I have broken at least 3 because I dropped them or they were attached to a tripod that got bumped or blew over in the wind. I did not test or accidentally test this feature.Video ModeI was really disappointed in the video mode.* Banding was observed when shooting indoors and outdoors. There was also a lot of that phenomenon where you get a pixelated edge on your subject. The manual says this may occur in the presence of fluorescent and other types of lighting. I observied it outdoors in ideal lighting. It is very annoying and negates the purpose of having an HD camera. It also has problems with autofocus when the subject is moving.* High Speed Mode: I was intrigued by the ability to record HS video (with a fast frame rate of up to 240 fps. And thus enabling smooth slow motion playback). There are lots of times this would be nice. Like when a friend is doing a backflip off a waterfall into a pool of water. It works OK. The super slo mo 240 fps mode is in VGA and requires ideal lighting or it comes out dark. One cool feature they thought of is the ability to have the camera start regular speed filming and at the opportune moment when you want to capture slow motion you hit the ""ok"" button and it films in HS until you hit ""ok"" again and then it goes back to regular speed.* The zoom speed is fixed. Thus you can't do a slow zoom vs a fast zoom. I know this is not intended to be a motion studio quality camera, but just be aware of what you are getting. In general I'd describe the zoom as fast and abrupt. I didn't like this.* It has a small light (emphasis on small) that can help brighten the filming. I guess it is better than nothing.* Cuts Wind noise: It has a feature that cuts wind noise while filming. I tried it out and it seemed to help a little. In the backcountry on exposed ridges high wind is common.GPS ModeIt has very basic GPS functions. The controls are very clunky. Having it turned on sucks your battery. It does seem to pick up the satellites well. It's cool to have GPS data recorded in your pics.DigiscopingIf this camera had functioned well for digiscoping I would have kept it. It almost worked--it sort of worked. As expected with most cameras, vingetting was apparent when initially attached with a the Swarovski DCA adaptor. The vingetting did disappear when I zoomed all the way to the max optical range--5x and the scope was on it's lowest power-20x. Interestingly, the vignetting started when I cranked up the spotting scope power to around 45X. At 60X it was quite noticeable. I thought it was awesome that the camera comes with a 40.5mm adaptor that can be used with filters of that size. It clips on over the camera lens and I was able to get a step-up adaptor so it would fit on my 52mm spotting scope attachment. The autofocus at times seemed a little tripped out than other cameras I've used when digiscoping. It would blur in and out trying to figure out what I was shooting at. It did take excellent videos and photos when I had the scope on 20X and the camera zoomed to 5X. Because the camera is light it seemed to hang fine.Picture QualityI wasn't blown away with the consistency of the photo quality. To be sure it took some excellent photos, but then it would totally blow some other shots. I'll defer to other reviews on this.* 16 Megapixels means you can ""posterize"" your trip or even get shots for a magazine.* Panorama Mode: I was excited about this mode--but only half of it really worked. It has this ""easy panorama mode where you can just pan the camera and it will instantly create a panorama. I works OK at best. It sometimes leaves the stitches a little weird. It also has a manual stitch mode that works well.In summary I wanted to love this camera but in the end I think it only partially lived up to it's bill as an adventure camera. The problematic power supply issues, poor HD video quality, terrible controls, inconsistent photo quality, and less than ideal digiscoping functionality were not enought to outweigh the positives of underwater mode, and high mega pixels. I hope my discussion of the details will help other backcountry users know what they are getting into if they buy this. Unfortunately I feel like I don't know what else to turn to right now.","January 31, 2012",0
cameras,"Buy it for water/abusing, nothing else","DC Machead ""DC Machead""",RK8XJWDMLXH6Z,3,"I purchased this camera in hopes that it could serve as a ""backup"" camera for when I didn't want to carry around my DSLR. It's a nice camera for daytime use/well-lit conditions, and use in water...but that's it. I took it along to go trick-or-treating last night and the pictures it took were awful.The biggest peeve I've got is the lag time between pressing the button and when the shot is taken. If you've got kids and want to get pictures of them, you'll miss a lot of shots with this camera. This camera is absolutely dreadful in low-light conditions. My iPhone takes better pictures in low-light conditions.Bottom line, if you want a camera to abuse and take in water, this is it.

cameras,"Good image quality, poor battery life and auto focus",David Wilton,R35F4ZXTIF8BTB,3,"The Nikon AW100 is a nice looking camera that produces very good images. However, it suffers horribly from two vexing problems. First, the battery life on this thing is extremely poor if you use the GPS, compass or maps features. If you plan to go on long hikes or camping with it, be sure to bring along lots of extra batteries. You'll be lucky to get more than an hour or two out of one charge with average to heavy use with maps, GPS and the compass features turned on. Second, focus is terrible. This thing takes forever to focus and often fires off before it achieves anything but a blur. For a camera meant for the outdoors, it craps out on a pretty important aspect of a point and shoot: reliable focus on anything but landscapes. Nikon has produced a pricey mediocre first effort in the tough camera segment. Might be better to take along a cheaper, less tough alternative and just be careful with it rather than rely on the AW100.","December 13, 2011",0
cameras,Good but be careful in the Ocean,ppl,RK9SJNHNTC3ST,3,"I was very happy with the camera, takes great pics both in and out of the water. I have owned a few underwater cameras and I really liked this one.Unfortunately I have to mark it down, not due to the camera per se but it did leak on me when I used it in the Ocean. I was very careful with the seal and only opened and closed it when fully dry (i.e. low humidity) and kept the seal clean. The leak happened when I was using it in the waves. They weren't huge waves but enough to cause leakage that shut down the camera. I had been using it in the water for about 20minutes before the leak and when it shut down I assumed the battery had run flat. Only on inspection did I find small amounts of salt water had got through the seal. It was enough to warrant sending it in for repair.Unfortunately Nikon refused to repair it free of charge which is another reason for the mark down. I understand this though as that would mean the camera was not up to the environment and it is marketed as a very tough camera. The claim ""The AW100 can handle all that Mother Nature can throw at it"" is a bit of an exaggeration. I was only snorkelling.","May 14, 2013",0
cameras,Impressed but couple of flaws,Anthony E Hornak,R2SYTLPPPT7P98,3,"I bought this camera a few months ago and take it with me everywhere. I love using it and I love the comfort factor that I can hand it to my kids to use without having to hoover over them. For me the Pro's outweigh the Cons. This camera is loads of fun.Cons:- BIG CON: Owner manual states to replace the seal on the door annually. I am ok with this but when I called Nikon to find out how much the annual maintenance would cost me they told me I had to mail the camera in for an estimate, hmm. They would NOT give me a price over the phone nor was I allowed to contact the place in New York where my camera would be shipped to for work. Everything would have to be done by mail. Why would a company who mass manufactures a product not know how much the seal/part cost and how much labor is required to perform a periodic maintenance that they themselves outlines as necessary? Secondly, why would they expect their customer to mail their AW100 camera in to an unknown facility; that the consumer is not allowed to contact or speak with; to later have an ""estimate"" mailed to them of work the mysterious people deemed necessary when your camera was working just fine to begin with. 3 stars for this alone.- Is not fog resistance. Guess you can't have everything- Performance is poor indoors/low light settings- When using the Flash the camera can take a few extra seconds to refresh. Not to be exact but I have seen ~5sec; could have been due to low battery.- I may need to mess with the setting a bit more but I do happen to get blurry pics when trying to catch my kids in motion. Auto focus lags when within a few feet range ie: 22ft - 6ft or so to give an example/not exact.- Video mode the auto focus is non-existent when zooming in.Pros:- This is an OUTDOOR camera. Taking pics outdoors is where it thrives. =D This is why I carry it everywhere with me because the pictures do come out very beautifully.- Zoom is acceptable for fix lenses.- Slow mode camera setting - very cool. Don't have a use for it yet but still cool.- Battery life is descent - last all day. Going to buy a spare battery just because I constantly used the camera and video mode definitely takes more juice. Love my videos.- Nice design - very compact and sleek.- Video mode is cool out of the water and in the water. Love it.Suggestion:- If you like going out in the water a lot whether at the beach, lake, on a boat buy a floating device for your camera. I have one. It is easy to take off.- IMPORTANT: When not in use OPEN up the battery door - the seal is made of rubber and even though it is a ""rugged"" camera it needs a little TLC. To ensure a good seal you need to allow the rubber to expand every once in a while instead of that yellow seal always staying compress when the door is closed.- Since the seal is rubber make sure it does not dry out. If it is looking like it might - treat it.- Place/buy scratch resistance screen protector for the back of the camera.- Also makes sure that the smallest granule of dirt is not between the seal and the camera before closing the battery door. Bad voodoo.Food for Thought:- I have bought some UV filters and a Macro lens for the camera. I will let you know how it goes but they are available.- Need to figure out how to get the water to fully bead off of the lens. Didn't have the issue till recently. I have found it hard to take pics with water spots blocking the image I am trying to capture and usually I am all wet so I do not have anything ""dry"" to wipe the lens - catch 22. May try RainX but still thinking about a solution.","August 4, 2012",0

MAkes a large compact camera big and impossible to fit in your pocket.Video is average, shooting anything moving it goes in an out of focus.In conclusion, This camera is an average camera, and if underwater video and photos are important I would purchase this camera. But trust me for a point and shoot this camera falls short. ITs not worth the price, but I do carry it with me on vacations for the 180 and 360 landscape function.","January 25, 2013",0
cameras,Step down from other Nikons,seewhatitdoes224,R1X5NBV8EITBR1,3,"Always bought Nikon cameras and have had great experiences. My last camera was the Nikon Coolpix S8100. That took incredible pictures but I always took it fishing and to the beach and sand got in the telescope lens and eventually it malfunctioned. Considering that I decided I'd definitely stick with Nikon and try the AW100 so I can take it anywhere. Here is what I've found:Pros:-Fairly small and compact. Easy to whip out and take a picture.-Great selection of colors (although I recommend not getting camo if you plan on taking this into to woods for obvious reasons).-Although I have limited underwater use, the ones I did take looked pretty good.-Seems fairly durable so far. Its taken a couple drops from four feet on a tennis court and held up (although video that had been recording is lost when it is dropped as the camera turns off).Cons:-Battery Life. You need more than one battery especially on trips where you will be taking videos.-Charger. You can't charge the battery in the camera. This is a must for ""all weather"" cameras. It at least should include a travel charger with a car charger or USB connection so you can charge it on the go. With this camera all that's included is an external battery charger that requires an outlet. This is a big downfall to this camera.-Images. Although this camera takes some very good pictures, occasionally it will take ones out of focus. The same thing happened a couple times with videos. Never had this happen with my previous Nikon S8100. I find I'm not as confident when I need to take a ""must have"" picture with this camera on the go.-Color. I got the Camo color because it was much cheaper on amazon than any of the other colors. If you really plan to use this outdoors though, I'd get orange or blue but you will pay more.-Video. Video is average to above average but the problem with it is when the camera falls the camera turns off and you lose all video you had been taking. I took about a half hours worth of tennis video. It took about a four foot fall and hit the court. The camera itself was fine afterwards but it had turned off and the video was gone after the fall. That was a bit disappointing. Maybe I had too much confidence in its advertised ""shock proofness"" though. I did contact customer service to ask them if this was normal and they said after a 4 foot fall I would ""have issues"". That's all they said.-Customer Service. I really would have liked more than a short answer as to why an ""all weather"" camera does the above when its advertised as being ""shock proof"" but it is what it is.Overall: Decent camera but a step down for Nikon. Image quality is a step down from regular cameras but that was to be expected as the lens in enclosed. Randomly taking poor quality blurry pictures doesn't help my confidence though as I never had this happe with my previous Nikon's. I haven't decided whether to take this one back or not. I would take a good hard look at others before buying this one. The battery charger is a huge issue as well with this camera for anybody that needs to charge on the run. Good luck.","January 13, 2013",0
cameras,Great but buggy,TX2PDX,R2PQZJFXYG2I2L,3,Great camera that takes even better video than pictures I think and the GPS is a nice extra. I took it on a trip and loved the rugged ability taking in and out of the water.Now for the bad ...1/2 way through the trip my screen went black and although I could view pics I had taken I couldn't take pictures. I took the battery out tried everything but nothing worked. I then threw it across the room in frustration (it is shockproof ya know) and it fixed it!! It worked great for a few days then black screen so I smacked it on my hand a few times and presto it's fixed. This occurred several more times on my 5 week trip.A women saw my camera and said she had the same one and loved it but the screen went black and she couldn't take pictures anymore and received no help from Nikon. I passed on my tough love treatment advise and hope it worked. Also several times in the water when it was cold the lens would fog up. Also when the outside air was cool (65 degrees) the LCD screen would heat up and then cause the lens to fog up. Not what you want when on top of a tropical forest zip lining and can't take pictures of that amazing place. That fix was to wait 10 minutes to defog and then take a pic then turn off the camera so it doesn't heat up. I will exchange the camera maybe I got a bad one which is a shame because it seems great.,"April 5, 2012",0
cameras,Mixed results,David F. Wald,R2TIECA4MPZ96Q,3,"Took it to the Galapagos Islands recently. You have to be careful not to block part of the lens with a finger when holding it since the lens is right at the top. The Chums float works perfectly with this camera fitting nicely around the wrist and able to float the camera if dropped. The battery door worked perfectly to keep water out. I don't see how anyone can have a problem with water damaging this camera so ignore all the messages here claiming that. The camera takes nice photos in bright light and nice videos without hearing any sounds from zooming. It's not as good in dimmer light as shutter speeds aren't kept high enough for moving objects. The big problem I found was even though I set the ISO to AUTO, when taking photos underwater in underwater mode it didn't adjust the ISO high enough to keep high shutter speeds when pointing the camera down. As a result almost all photos of moving fish and sea lions came out blurred (not possible to get sharp shots of fast swimmers at 1/60 or 1/80 or even 1/100 sec). It seemed to increase the ISO automatically only to 125 or 200. My other camera I used underwater (Canon in a 10 ft max depth housing) increased ISO to very high numbers (800+) to keep shutter speed fast. It was worth it to get non-blurred shots with that camera even though they came out grainy. I guess the only way to get the Nikon to work well underwater with moving objects is to fix the ISO at 400 or 800.","June 22, 2012",0
cameras,"Rugged, but poor picture quality",Bryan,RRKA8SJC7P1KF,3,"I have tried a few waterproof cameras, and they all share something in common - subpar picture quality. This is a tough little camera and has some really nice features like GPS and Wifi and a very fast response when you press the shutter button, but I have a very hard time getting a quality picture. In anything other than ideal lighting conditions, or with any motion at all, the pics are always blurry and just generally disappointing. And the other waterproof cameras I've tried suffer similar problems compared to other quality traditional point and shoot cameras.So unless you REALLY need an indestructible camera, I recommend a traditional one for better photo quality.","December 31, 2013",0
cameras,Great idea but...,Kugelspritzer,R3TJTLY0DOJFD1,3,"I bought this camera because I've had several Nikons in the past and they have all worked flawlessly. Not the case with this camera. It wouldn't power up when I got it. I made sure the battery was charged fully, tried it again, nothing. I was not foiled by its refusal to submit to my commands so easy however, and I continued to remove the battery and push the power button until... It came on! I thought maybe I could work with it, but alas, the next time I attempted to power it up, same thing. After several more attempts, I came to the conclusion it was never going to work and as much as I hate to I was going to have to send it back. Praise be to AMAZON... I was able to send it back with no hassle what so ever. I then read others reviews of this camera and decided to go with thePamasonic Lumix DMC-TS5A and couldn't be happier.","December 30, 2013",0
cameras,"Good waterproof camera, but bad general camera",Rodan,R3TCRWZS3N2NP8,3,"I am a professional photographer, with a rather substantial array of Nikon cameras and lenses. I like to take a point and shoot on my travels (or to events) to grab the occasional shot when I'm not carrying my camera gear. I had a great Canon PowerShot SD-950, which was small and took great pix, but it died during a recent trip. After considerable investigation, I got the Coolpix AW100, since it was both small/light and waterproof. It also had GPS, which was an added bonus.On the positive side, this is a very small camera, with a 10mp sensor that shoots full HD video. Really terrific in a small package.This camera has several major drawbacks. Principle among them is the poor quality shadow detail. Pictures are just not very good - something I would not expect in a Nikon camera (even a point and shoot). The image quality is quite unacceptable to me. Granted that I am picky, but other point and shoots seem to have better image quality.Secondly, this camera a very slow from the time you press the shutter until the image is captured. This is especially true on flash mode. Very annoying. And, if you hold the shutter down in low light, but the camera decides it doesn't need a flash, it will capture multiple images.In flash mode, the camera seems to overexpose all pictures. You can compensate for this using the manual exposure adjustment. But you have to remember to do that each time you turn the camera on. Sort of defeats the concept of point and shoot.And lastly, the battery life is pretty poor. Probably due to the GPS to some degree. (On my Nikon D4, adding the GPS attachment cuts the battery life in half or more.)If you really need a waterproof camera, this might be a good choice. But if you want an all-around point and shoot, pick a different one. I just bought the Sony Cybershot RX100M2. I'll post a review soon.","November 4, 2013",0
cameras,Lens condensation blurs photos,R. Waddell,RCZGW920HU4Z,3,"I purchase this camera 9/1/2012 because I wanted a camera to take with me while boating. It takes nice pictures at first, but after getting splashed a few times it gets condensation on the lens that will either leave images foggy, or leave them with fog spots. It is frustrating as there is no water getting into the camera. Perhaps it is the change of temperature from cold water and warm weather, but after seeing other reviews it seems like others experience the same issue without splashing the camera.","June 7, 2013",0

cameras,Great Idea Fails To Deliver,3ddy,R15C8JQO2RXD8R,3,"I purchased this item primarily so that I could do some photos while snorkeling. And while the camera does a serviceable job on normal photos, it suffers from two large issues. (1) The lens window fogs easily, making any photos taken pretty much useless until the window clears. (2) The low light performance is poor. In addition, my unit went into a lock/freeze mode in the ON condition (couldn't turn it OFF) where no buttons would function and it significantly discharged the battery in the span of 2 or 3 minutes. Had to remove the battery to reset it so that I could use it again. This only happened once; but, I'd only just purchased the unit a couple of weeks prior and have since sent it to NIKON for repair.By the way, NIKON's current return/repair process is not all that great. Basically send it in at your expense and we'll get back to you at some point. No easy way to talk to anyone about your issue at all prior to sending an item in. Again, I'm surprised since my prior NIKON experiences several years back were great.The first item was surprising, as I was taking this camera to the beach and had some minor sea spray splash on the camera window. Guess what, the window fogged right where the drops of water hit. I could only imagine what would happen if I submerged it. In addition, as I was exploring some ancient temple ruins and went from the outdoors to inside the temple the lens fogged again. Same for some caves I was in. Fogged lens = no or poor photos. While I have sent the camera in for repair, a late arriving email (took NIKON 2 weeks to answer) indicated that NIKON does have some language in the manual (and in the small print on it's advertisements if you can find it) that the lens may fog when the camera is subjected to ""extreme"" temperature shocks in humid environments. Just how many of you have ever jumped into water that was warmer than the outside air when snorkeling? And by definition, snorkeling is normally a humid environment. But, NIKON did cover their behind I suppose. Buyer beware and read the small print. I don't think they will be repairing my unit for this unanticipated feature, but we'll see.However, the camera is light and takes a pretty good photo if you have plenty of light. And, hopefully I'll be surprised at NIKON service after a rocky start. I'd really like to like this camera.","December 16, 2012",0
cameras,"Good, not great!",Emily,R33JU82LFR39WQ,3,"I bought this camera with the original intention of going to Costa Rica. This was going to be a tough trip, so I knew I needed a tough camera. about a 5 days in to the trip the lens started fogging up at very inopportune times, both in the water and out! This was inside the viewing screen as well as the actual lens. Then later it would go back to normal and take good pictures. I really loves this camera and the ease of use, but it failed me in so many situations. On top of this when I sent it back to the manufacturer to be repaired, they said they no longer make the part the camera needs (even though it is a relatively new camera) and would be sending me a check. This is after them having the camera for around two months and I am still waiting. I like the camera, but not enough to buy a new one I don't think.","August 24, 2012",0
cameras,Caribbean Review,V. Brancart,R4QWX4S08NEJX,3,"I recently took this camera on a bareboat charter through the British Virgin Islands so we had lots of exposure to the elements, both on the yacht as well as underwater. The camera lives up to its expectations as an underwater camera and I can't find fault with what it has to offer. The pictures and video are what one would expect in ocean waters with various water quality and lighting. To be fair, I did shoot some pics and video in the local pool and they were awesome. My criticism pertains to the pictures as some other reviewers have noted. Due to the small lens, the pictures are not that ""crisp"" in my opinion. I tried all the various pre-assigned exposures and I was not impressed with the quality. Therefore I am returning the camera and will be purchasing a housing unit for an existing point and shoot that I currently own to use underwater.","August 22, 2012",0
cameras,Not up to snuff compared to competitors,B. Hayes,R1S0ZUK1V6HFK,3,"I was really hoping that this camera would be a keeper. After putting it through some basic paces, I was disappointed in the functionality and somewhat by the image quality. Rather than get into a lengthy review here is why I returned it: - Slow shot to shot performance (indoors) - When battery gets to 50%, it takes forever for the flash to recharge - Poor low light performance, especially in video (my iphone 4 took better video with low light) - Poor auto focus tracking when shooting video, especially when zooming - Audible camera sounds in video when zooming and focusing - Image quality not up to standards of competitors such as Canon and Sony - Some barrel distortion at wide angleI understand that this camera is a niche market with the ruggedness, however, there are competitors that have comparable cameras with better performance and image quality.","January 12, 2012",0

However, i took pictures in a pool that was only 4 1/2 feet deep and the camera flooded. I sent it back and got fixed one in two weeks. I love how they send a little pamphlet that explains how to use it under water. Bottom line is the seals are faulty and i will not take the chance of the camera flooding again.

cameras,First Impression,Tek9,RUAR6REO0AZD1,3,"I bought this for an upcoming trip where I'll be exposed to water & hiking. The two things that made me opt out for the Nikon AW100 vs Canon's D20 was that it had a color option of black & the higher megapixels. While waiting for the battery to charge I went through and read some of the literature that came with the camera. I was immediately concerned when I read in the section of ""For Your Safety"" & how to care for your camera that it told you not to submerge or expose to moisture & not to expose to shock & vibrations. I initially thought that it might be some default typing for the Coolpix product family, but then I looked at the header & it's strictly for the Coolpix AW100. At this time I felt uneasy of actually exposing this camera to water & I am considering returning it. I wrote to Nikon about the print vs the advertising of what you can do & shouldn't do with this camera. Will post their response when I get it.After battery charged up, I fired some shots at different settings. For a point & shoot with a SanDisk Extreme SDHC card, it takes pretty fast pictures. I noticed about a 1/2 second in delay after pressing the shutter button. I'm already thinking that even though it's smaller & easier to carry around than my DSLR's, it's not going to be a good tool for taking pics of my kids which are constantly on the move. I also noticed that with the flash on auto 60% of my pics were over exposed.Overall, good size.

cameras,"Decent camera, but freezes up",Melinda cline,RMPQUFPKUDUFU,3,"I bought this camera for shallow (snorkeling) underwater pics and video and so I wouldn't have to worry about water damage in everyday use. I also have young kids around, and didn't want to have to worry about dropping damage. I used it for snorkeling and it worked ok. Pictures are decent. It frequently had too slow of shutter speed in auto mode so pics were blurred. The major problem is that the first one I got would freeze up(no button would work and it wouldn't turn off) and I would have to take the battery out to restart it. I exchanged it and the new one is doing the same thing. I just have to remember to turn it off after every picture instead of letting it go into sleep mode.

cameras,"Pricey and not thoroughly ""waterproof""",Lara M. Lichten,R1KP7MA9GH8C23,3,"At first I was very pleased with this camera, having been my first purchase of an underwater camera (though not my only experience using one). Compared to others I have tried, this one is a bit less impressive. While it serves its purpose underwater (if the water is clear enough, that is), it takes a while for the lens to dry off to take smear- and drip-free photos in dry air. Additionally, in heat/humidity, the lens fogs up, preventing clear images from being taken when not underwater. Moisture must have gotten inside during some of our underwater exploits. It's disappointing to have this problem in an UNDERWATER camera. An additional complaint I have to report regards the camera's lack of promptness in rapidly taking multiple photos. It takes a good 10 seconds to recuperate and ready itself for another image to be shot, which is frustrating for users who are not familiar with the camera (i.e. volunteer tourists who offer to take a photo for you, and then don't realize that 1. the button needs to be pressed and HELD for at least 2-3 seconds in order to effectively take the photo, and 2. it takes a LONG time for the camera to ready itself for subsequent photo-taking attempts). I wouldn't recommend this camera at the top of my list for buying an underwater camera. However, it has done the job, mostly, and is less aggravating than other cameras that have shutters (which have caused me the most problems in my past experience with digital cameras).","August 26, 2013",0

cameras,It definitely works.. just not well.,Sam,R1XT4UF1CNVF5W,3,"By way of background, I'm the quintessential ""pro-sumer"". I have enough interest and ability to appreciate good equipment and make use of it; but not enough to invest in super-high-end equipment. My workhorse is a Nikon D80, but I don't suffer from brand loyalty the way some photogs do; my backup P+S is a Canon powershot, with which I've been extremely satisfied.Bottom line first: I was disappointed with this camera, and actually a little surprised at just how disappointed. For almost $300, I think it should perform better; I'm not expecting a top-quality image, but it should at least compete with the basic point-and-shoots. I figured that this would end up replacing my Canon as my backup camera, but basically I've ended up with a D-SLR, a P+S, and now a waterproof camera that I will only be using when I don't want to expose the other two to the elements. However, it does do one thing well: it's a tough cam, and it's proven itself very well in this regard. I've used it in the pool and on the beach so far, and haven't had any issues whatsoever.PROS: can be summed up as, it does what it's technically supposed to- Definitely feels solid in my hand. No question about whether it's going to fall apart on me.- Haven't had even a hint of moisture seep into it after pretty extensive use in somewhat rough waves (only caveat is that I haven't taken it any deeper than 5 feet so far)- GPS is a very handy feature. I never really thought I'd need or want it (geotagging is disabled on my phone), but it's really nice having an extra GPS unit when you're, say, kayaking and don't have your phone on you.CONS: can be summed up as, it doesn't do it well- Autofocus is pitiful at times. I have no idea what it's trying to focus on sometimes. I've tried adjusting the settings, and so far it seems that the continuous AF mode is absolutely useless (so much for action shots).- There's no auto-bracket. Seems like an easy feature to include. I am kind of shocked that it's not available.- The auto-rotate feature makes no sense to me whatsoever. Some photos are rotated on the camera's display (even though I'd prefer to disable that, but can't because it's not an option), but when I import them to my computer they need to be manually rotated. And again, very inconsistent. You can take the same shot several times in a row, and some are displayed vertical vs some horizontal.- The menus are not at all intuitive. Maybe I'm being critical, but on my D80 there are probably 5-6x as many entries, and somehow they're better organized than this. It makes it even more apparent that this menu is poorly organized, because its similar design reminds me of the D80, and how it COULD be better.- This one is really weird... I think there's a ""feature"" where if you shake the camera while in playback mode, it scrolls to the next image. Sometimes it goes forward, and sometimes it goes back. I haven't figured out a consistent way to make one vs the other happen. At first I thought my D-pad buttons were malfunctioning, but it definitely doesn't do this in any mode other than playback. I've tried to disable this in the menus, but unless it's somehow hidden (which I doubt, I've really given this some effort), I don't think this is something you can turn off. What's more, it's really inconsistent in how sensitive it is. I'm just waiting for the day that the photo switches right as I'm pushing the DELETE button and end up getting rid a photo I actually liked.- Oh, and in case the last point is related to the ""action control"" button: I've disabled this too. Some reviewers seem to really like it. It's every bit as gimmicky as it sounds. Yes, it lets you make a VERY LIMITED number of adjustments; but by the time you've shake-scrolled your way through the menu, you might as well have taken off your gloves and done it the right way.","June 3, 2013",0

As soon as I turned it on and took the first picture, it was blurry. I thought I would give it a try though. I read the manual and tried to change the settings. The speed is slow, and processing of the picture is slow. Out of 5 pictures I would take (whatever I was photographing), probably 3 would come out blurry and 1-2 would be a keeper. I would spend more time deleting pictures, and missing opportunities to capture a picture perfect moment. I would have to tell my subjects to remain very still while taking a picture. Not easy when you have a 2 year old. Even using the ""sports"" option didn't work. Images were blurred and overly bright or dark.The only pros I can see is that it is waterproof (although I haven't checked this) and is supposed to be shockproof.I own a Nikon D5000, and am happy with it.

It seemed to hold up at first, but the moisture worked its way in after 15 minutes.I mainly use waterproof cameras for whitewater kayaking where it's not unusual to have a significant difference between air and water temperature. Lens window fogging is a common problem with this type of camera in these conditions but the Nikon was more vulnerable to it than others I've used.Some of the buttons are a bit difficult to activate with cold, wet fingers. The battery life is adequate.Not a bad choice for light duty. But, it wouldn't be my first choice for more extreme conditions.","March 11, 2013",0
cameras,What is up with the lag time?,R. K. Tolentino,R7GIJIYYMWMKO,3,"This camera was purchased for my husband who is a wildland firefighter. We also purchased a Nikon S8200 at the same time for me. My husband used the AW100 while he was on fires this summer and really liked it. Since he returned home, we have been using his camera because mine is now reading ""lens error"" every time I try to turn it on. Anyway, back to the AW100... it takes great clear shots, but what is up with the lag time of taking pictures? I press the button, wait.....and then it takes the shot. Definitely not good when trying to capture a shot of our 3 year old or 1 year old! Also, some of the pictures we take are either washed out (mostly white) or really dark. It's set on the auto mode, so I don't know what's going on with it. If it would just work right, it would be a great camera!","January 20, 2013",0

I was especially attracted to the waterproof, underwater possibilities of this camera after having lost a previous ""point & shoot"" model to water damage. As I read the manual, it became clear that using this in a water environment required special care I wouldn't be able to provide (e.g. ...allow camera to sit in clear water within 1/2 hour of water submersion...). also, not particularly impressed w/ the functioning, results of product. like i said, maybe many years use of dSLRs doesn't make me best judge for this camera.","January 1, 2013",0

I got it for my daughter because she said it was waterproof, shockproof, etc., and has a GPS. She spent one day putting it to the test and the next day it quit working. The led screen was completely black and I tried everything to fix it, resetting it, etc. SO DISAPPOINTING. I sent it to Nikon and I must say they were great. They replaced it at no charge with the same model and color. This one is still working but I have told her DON'T GET IT WET. It may say waterproof but I'm not so sure about that. It does take EXCELLENT pictures, better than any camera I've ever had. It is a little complicated, however, lots of bells and whistles that I haven't taken the time to learn yet.

cameras,Not the best camera of it's stature,AmyAmes,R3OTXGP3NT1JYR,3,"For the past 5 years I've owned an array of waterproof/shockproof camera. My problem used to be damage to my digital camera and now my problem is losing the undestructable camera. Anyhow, I've had my shares of these types of cameras. The Nikon COOLPIX is a fun color, easy to use and takes pretty good pictures. I've had the camera for about 2 months now and have taken it skiing, hot tubbing, through family functions with children and it's survived. The only reason why I didn't give it all 5 stars is because I had the Olympus camera and it's by far the best in class. Prior to a water tubing incident where I somehow came up out of a turned over tube in water with beer in one hand and no camera in the other, I had the Olympus for over a year. I've never had any functionality problems with it, and as far as user friendly was concerned, it was top notch. The Nikon however is stuck on a setting where the flash is only on auto or off. On auto, it doesn't always take the best pictures at night because the flash doesn't go off and there is NO WAY to make the thing go off until you take a million pictures and hopes it flashes. It's also stuck on a setting where all the pictures on the review, is on a slide show and I cannot for the life of me figure out how to get it off of the slideshow. The manual didnt help so now I'm stuck. The only thing the Nikon has the Olympus could do a better job at is clarity and auto focus. Even in the dark it has an amazing clarity to it, even though its just.. dark. I'll probably use this camera for another couple of months and hope I am able to keep it at bay but if I lose this one, I'll most likely go back to the Olympus.","January 24, 2012",0

cameras,Not for us,Gina Sharp,R25BVBKYL8I0U7,3,"I chose this camera because it was supposed to be one of the best ruggedized cameras. I, honestly, can't say how well it takes pictures because I only took two before I knew it had to go back. There are a few protrusions on the casing (the lens and a couple I didn't know what they were for) that make me feel like, if I dropped it, they could break really easily. Also, there a ton of options for shooting and no touch screen. So, you have to go through each one by pushing the buttons...kind of tedious. And the panorama feature... you have to take each picture separately, piecing them together by the shadow image of the previous pic, which is also tedious. I immediately returned this one and bought the Sony DSC-TX20.","March 5, 2013",0
cameras,Has a bit of a learning curve,"Karen Boylan ""Silly Aunty!""",R3BWQOU1SIQLM1,3,"This will be my the fifth CoolPix camera I have purchased in 15 years. I have purchased them for myself, for use at my office and one for my mother. So I needless to say I feel myself pretty knowledgeable about the CoolPix settings and navigating through its menus. However htis camera's software is set up much differently than all the other CoolPix.It has an automatic setting - so you do not have to choose your scene and it should judge the condistions and choose the most optimal...This automatic setting works horribly. Our first use o the camera was outside on a bright sunny day. The pictures were wonderful, sharp clear and vibrant color. However anything shot indoors on auto is cloudy and grainy and out of focus. I have noticed that I can be indoors in pretty average to bright light and it will choose the night landscape setting resulting in blurred photos. Or it chooses the underwater setting that results in hazy photos. I have been trying to shoot night landscape and it has selected a different indoor setting resulting in dark photos. for anything I take indoors I pretty much have to use the indoor party setting and the backlight setting does not seem to work as well as the other models I have.When the camera is set to the appropriate setting they are sharp clear and good qulaity, But for a point and shoot it takes a little more effort than I would prefer and the automatic setting is useless.","January 21, 2013",0

I've made two help requests, and gotten replies that come no where near addressing the questions I asked about software. I will probably not buy (nor accept gifts of) Nikon again if this is the norm.If anyone is interested there is a free sourceforge.net package, gphoto2 ver 2.5.0, that will let you transfer images from the Camera to a PC running Linux.

cameras,Disappointed in waterproofing and the battery charger,JimBob,R26DHXCVLTXCGN,3,"This is just a heads up... everyone has different purchasing criteria, but for me the AW100 is not going to make the grade ... two things:1) The only negative thing I have read about the AW100 that caught my attention was that a number of reviewers have had trouble with water intrusion. I received my AW100 today, and upon examining the sealing mechanism for the battery/memory card access hatch, I can see why ... it is a single-edge/lip compression seal that could be easily compromised by an overlooked piece of grit or strand of hair. For comparison, if you take a look at how the Olympus TG-820 door is sealed I assure you ... it will instill considerably more confidence.2) My other disappointment ... and I will admit I overlooked this attribute until I received my AW100. The battery (apparently) can not be charged in the camera. You must remove the battery and charge it in the (provided) charger. The charger is not very compact, and ships with a separate power cord (not one of the built-in/flip-out plugs). I need to travel light, and for me not being able to recharge the camera from a mini or micro USB charger (which I will already be carrying with me for my cell phone and other items) is a hassle and also adds weight and bulk.","May 22, 2012",0

The Fuji waterproof/shockproof camera was useless, so I decided to try this one. What can I say other than its pretty good. Reasonably durable, and takes pretty good pictures. It is slow, and doesn't really have as many options and modes as other cameras, or maybe they are there but the menus are too hard to navigate. In general, I'd say if you want something more durable than average, this may fill the gap for you.","September 9, 2012",0

laptops,GREAT LAPTOP BUT STILL WAITING FOR ONE TO WORK,"Dane Wells ""Advocate of Education""",R2QB0EESTH5TAM,3,"I purchased 4 laptops from Amazon...the XA1 model, the A1 model, 3 were 17 inch and one was 15 inch. After sending all 4 back here is my take on ASUS and the republic of gamers laptop. First off none were impacted by the new Sandy Beach processor (at least not that I was able to single out). The bottom line is either you get a good one or a bad one. Regardless some things are the same. Frist, yes there is bloatware and no two reivewers have removed it the same way and once you do there are messeage errors that haunt your system. The lighted keyboard is sometimes working and sometimes not working. Yes you can reload drivers or press fn and f4 or you can reboot or you can pray but in the end its always something and there are multiple ways to fix the problem however does the solution stick (I am not sure it does). Yes sleak design and great feel, and packed with a lot of punch and amazing display....but how many times do you have to reinstall the software after you have backed it up for 2 1/2 hrs? I am not going to discuss the weight or size of battery life cause its a gaming laptop and the last 5 reviews have all been on the money. Asus needs to pay attention to detail and take care of the things mentioned over and over again. Yes put some things on the back of the laptop so right handed and left handed folks dont have the power cord and other devices in their way. I believe ASUS has built the best bang for the buck and can do even better by paying atteniton to the words that others have taken time to write. I will more than likely give this another try and pray the 5th time is a charm. I have a desk top with ASUS COMPONENTS AND IT ROCKS!!! ASUS IF YOU ARE LISTENING ...GIVE US BACK UP DISKS ALL READY TO GO...GET RID OF BLOATWARE YOU CAN DO WELL WITHOUT IT (VOLUME SALES). Hard drives not be divided.....You are kicking ALIENWARE AND OTHERS TO THE CURB. Read carefully the reivewers from AMAZON CUSTOMERS AND YOU WILL GO FAR. As for me, I am going to buy another one and hope this time I get a laptop that works and not one that dies, freezes, sends me error messages when I try to connect to the internet, goes blank after rebooting, lets me play WOW without kicking me off the game on numerous occasions, and last but not least....delivers everything its meant to deliver and more........I will follow up with another review after I get my next laptop.

Going to sleep isn't a problem, Opening the lid and hitting the power button is. the laptop will not return from sleep mode when you hit the power button. I did some research and found that the magnetic sensor in the chasis is to blame. It is a strong magnet that keeps its charge even after you have opened the lid it thinks its still closed. I have to use a fridge magnet slid across the mouse pad to reduce the magnetic charge so when I hit the power button it will bring the laptop out of sleep mode.

laptops,"Great Looks, Speedy Laptop. Gets hot and loud under moderate CPU load.","Alex Green ""alx779""",R3MKO486GGK450,3,"I have been using my new 13"" Macbook Air, 256GB, Core i7 for just over a week and here are my impressions...First, the good stuff...- The industrial design is absolutely gorgeous and rock-solid. The laptop is thin, light and pleasure to look at.- Screen is 13"" but the resolution is comparable to that of most 15""+ laptops. Perfectly usable for graphic/software development. While Macbook Air uses (supposedly) an inferior TN panel compared to Macbook Pro, I did not find a drastic difference between the two (I also own a 17"" Macbook Pro). The Air has slightly smaller viewing angles and perhaps not as good colour reproduction, but the differences are subtle. Also, there's a lot less glare on Air's ""glossy"" display compared to glossy Macbook Pro.- Performance is great, in some cases it bests the Quad Core i7 17"" Macbook Pro, thanks to its SSD Drive. Startups/shutdowns are super fast and the applications open/close almost instantly. Having said that, do not expect to do any serious gaming on this little guy. The built-in Intel graphics chip has hard time handling even 5 year old games and is actually slower than nVidia chip on the previous generation Air.- Expect to get about 4-5 hours of mixed use out of ""7 hour"" battery. That's what I average while doing some Photoshop and web dev work, browsing, listening to music and viewing a few video clips.Now, the negatives...Well, it's one negative really, but it is something I find extremely annoying. The laptop gets VERY hot when CPU usage approaches 50% and the fan kicks in full-blast at 6,000+ RPM.I first noticed the excessive noise when I was transferring my data and applications from the time machine backup upon initial setup. The fan stayed on entire time, CPU temperature was approaching 90C while being only 30% utilized.I continued to experience high heat/fan noise issues throughout the week. Sometimes it was during routine web browsing where some of the websites contained Flash elements. Starting Windows XP in Parallels would immediately set the fan in motion, again, sometimes hitting 6,000+ rpm. Playing Civilization IV, a fairly old game, had fan going full blast entire time with CPU again reaching 90C. Apple's own ""Cosmos"" screensaver brings the CPU temperature up to 80-85C and the fan up to 4500-5000rpm. The most annoying thing -- none of these tasks were taxing the CPU at more than 50%!I did a fair bit of research on this issue. There are multiple discussions on Apple, MacRumours and other forums about excessive heat and fan noise. Also, many report increased heat on their older Apple laptops after upgrading to Lion, so perhaps (fingers crossed), there's a patch on the way that will improve thermal management somewhat.The thought about returning the Air for refund did cross my mind, but I decided to keep it in the end. I am not a gamer and doing my work (web/mobile development) is not very taxing on the CPU, however, I do not think it is unreasonable to expect relatively quiet operation on such premium laptop with only 50% CPU usage. I can only hope that Apple is listening and looking to remedy the problem.***Update: March 28, 2012***It has been several months since I purchased the Air, so I thought I'd write a quick update.There were no software updates from Apple that would fix the overheating issue. Some claim in the comments that the thermal problems are limited to Macbook Air Core i7 version, however, I got to play with friend's Core i5/120Gb Air and got the fan hitting 6,000+ rpm simply by opening two browser tabs with YouTube videos in them. The playback has become choppy pretty quickly as well. The fan was also audible on pages with a few Flash elements in it (like newspaper sites). It seemed slightly (very slightly) less prone to heat issue, but it's definitely there.I also played around with an 11"" Macbook Air Core i5 at the Apple Store and, interestingly enough, it handled Flash far better than (supposedly) more powerful 13""... I opened 5! 1080p YouTube videos and still wouldn't hear the fan... Quite amazing actually. The difference seems to be the i5/i7 processors in the 13"" Air that can hit higher clock speeds but nearly frying the internals in the process.If you find your Macbook Air fan going off like a jet engine every time you visit YouTube or any page with Flash content, here are a couple of browser plugins that I found helpful (they block movies until you specifically click on them):- FlashBlock for Firefox- ClickToFlash for SafariThere's a model refresh coming sometime this summer, apparently, and I hope Apple will figure out the way to solve this problem. Of course, much depends on Intel chips that they're going to use in new models.","August 15, 2011",0
laptops,"Good laptop, but overhyped",Nick,R11HIY6RKIZUBF,3,"I've been using a Macbook Air for a week now. I have the 2011 13"" ultimate: i7 1.8GHz, 4GB RAM, and 256SSD. My main uses are Office for Mac 2011, Skype, internet video, ArcGIS/Windows 7, Mathmatica, Matlab, C/C++, objective-C, and Java. At the moment I mainly use the Air for writing documents. I am trying to live with the Air as my primary machine and I plan to connect it to a thunderbolt monitor for additional screen real estate.Pros:The Air looks beautiful and Lion is an absolute pleasure to use. The SSD makes it all work together. The screen is gorgeous to look at under the right lighting conditions and the resolution is fantastic. The keyboard is generally good. The track pad is awesome and the diagonal cut of the case is much easier for writing on than my previous unibody macbook.Cons:* Build quality. The renowned Apple quality seems to be lacking in my unit. The space bar does not always respond and requires two press from time to time. The F5 key needs to be hit multiple times in order to work. The case does not seem to fit properly in the lower right corner of the unit and flexes. The screen gets darker edges near the silver bezel.* Skype and facetime. I find that the placement of the mic on the side of the unit is a disaster for these applications. I am constantly responding to complaints about poor voice quality that only improves if I turn the machine on its side and speak directly into the mic. Depending on your use this may not be a big problem, but it is for me.* The screen can be irritatingly reflective under fluorescent lighting, but I can usually adjust my position to compensate. However, I usually need to use a low screen illumination to get reasonable battery life, which compounds any glare problems. This is not a major issue unless you are sensitive to glare.* The battery life on my unit is not great. The first two days I was impressed with 7+ hours. A week later and I'm lucky to get 4 hours. Disappointingly the unit does not always seem to hold a full charge. I'm not even sure I could watch a full-length movie without mains power. Part of the problem is flash, but watching any video drains the battery at an alarming rate. The battery monitor also does not seem to provide a reasonable estimate of remaining time.* When watching video I have noticeable screen stutter. This could be a result of the streaming service I use, but I'm not sure. It is not so bad that I would return the unit for it, but it is there and if you value smooth video then be sure to check it out carefully before you buy.* The Air gets blisteringly hot near the charger connection when running heavy applications. The fan comes on and battery life evaporates. Some complain the fan is noisy, but my main problem is the impact on battery life.* The ram can only be maxed out at 4GB. This is really annoying when you need to dual boot and is compounded by the graphics chip using main memory.* There are also two SSDs (Samsung and Toshiba) that the machine ships with. I ended up with the slower Toshiba drive. I do get the beach ball from time to time, but I could not say that this is related to my unit shipping with the slower Toshiba drive. Generally things are snappy. However, instant on is not always instant. I don't know if this is related to the slower Toshiba drive or just the applications I have open.All in all this is a good machine, but not outstanding. I would say the Macbook Air has been seriously overhyped. It has some strong points. I enjoy using it and the portability and weight are outstanding. However, I am genuinely frustrated by the mic placement and poor build quality. There are solutions, but when you spend $1700 plus tax on a machine I think you have the right to expect it to work. The Toshiba drive is annoying, but may not be significant and the battery life is a worry. I'm not sure how the machine will standup to the day-to-day grind.This unit is going back to the store and Apple deserves full credit for its return/refund policies. The 14 day, no restocking fee, window offered to return or exchange a unit is outstanding.**** Update September 30:Apple's customer service is fantastic. Apple provided a new unit which seems to have fewer build quality problems: all the keys work, the unit shipped with the Samsung SSD, and the microphone is much better. However, I still have problems with the microphone position and sensitivity and while battery life is better on this unit it is still not great for watching video. Instant on is still not instant on, but I can support other reviewers who have not noticed any performance difference between the Samsung and Toshiba SSDs, although I'm glad I have the samsung drive. All-in-all my new Air deserves at least another 1/2 star, may be even a whole star because of Apple's customer service.","September 12, 2011",0
laptops,Nice but not worth the $$$,Amazon Customer,R2NM6QSNR7NNN5,3,"Thanks to my profession I have been able to use a Mac AIR over a year and have been recently upgraded to latest version of one.Overall its a great lap top but its also $1000. You could get a more powerful Wintel laptop for half the money. I realize that is sacrilege to MAC OS guru's. But the fact is as easy and solid as apple tries to make OS X and MAC hardware they both still have some issues.- Both versions of the mac air I use and a MAC pro I also use constantly drop WIFI. While non-mac laptops attached to the same WAP do not drop. The frustrating thing is the apple goes out of their way to hide all of the real advanced settings that may actually fix the issue. I understand they want to make these things like a toaster and thats fine, but some time you need to open the ""hood"" and fiddle with the ""engine"". OS X is based on a UNIX variant and I have been working on various UNIX flavors for 16 years, I am no stranger to UNIX OS's. But even at the CLI level they hide many of the advanced tools that one could use if one should run into an issue. Of course you can pack the thing up and take it to the genius bar, which may cost you money.BTW in windows or linux you are able to get to the advanced settings easily enough if needed.- As much as I don't love windows because of its instability, make no mistake OS X is not immune. While it is overall more stable than windows 7 it does have its moments of instability. Run it too hard or open too many windows it can freeze or hang. Matter of fact I notice when I run the airs and the pro hard I see bluetooth devices loose connectivity, especially the mouse, and the only way to get it back is to reboot. Wait I thought windows only did that, well OS X does too unfortunately, albeit not as much.- OSX still is safer than windows as far as viruses go, but that is because there are more virus written for windows. IT is not because OS X is immune. Purchasing virus software is a good idea.- Software is still kind of limited for the Mac, and the ones that are available are usually pricy. Sometimes I just want to play a game, but most of the good ones run on windows. If you are not a gamer or power user and just want something to surf the net why pay the big bucks when you can get a Acer for under $400.I can ramble all day with the comparisons but end of the day the Mac air is a cool device and sleek but I wouldn't dole out my money for it.","January 29, 2012",0
laptops,not as good as it looks,neutrino,RPP1GJG073WVJ,3,"update 2/4/2013. The battery performance is really poor. Today, i charged it to 100%, used it for about 30 minutes and then let it sleep for three hours. After using it for another ~ 30 minutes it died. I only surfed websites, no video or graphic intensive sites were visited. Brightness was set to ~ 70% and keypad backlit was on. The video card performance is again quite inadequate. other than those issues, no breakdowns or problems.**************************************************My wife gave me a 13 inch Mac air a month ago. After playing with it for a month, i have to say, it is a good machine with lots of shortcomings. To use a car analogy, i would compare it to the Honda S2000; lots of fun, reliable, beautiful piece of sculpture, but a bit low on oomph.I will quickly summarize the pro's and con's.Pro-1. Slick designSturdy construction2. Light weight3. Speedy processor for light duty work4. Intuitive integration of software.5. Keyboard with back lighting6. Still the best ultrabook available, but that is about to change in less than a year with several new entries into the segment.7. Apps available.8. Individual keys for volume and brightness control. This allow simple and quick changes.9. Probably the best and most important feature of the laptop is the bright and high resolution screen. It makes reading 10X easier and more comfortable.10. Stable OS11. Supposedly pretty much virus free. Unfortunately, i can't say the same with window systems.12. No moving parts to break down except the cooling fan which comes on only rarely.13. Trackpad- more useful than just the good old track pads, but function is a bit unreliable and takes some training.Cons-1. Battery life is no where close to the claimed > 7 hours, unless you turn off Wifi, set at very dim level and do not run video. For routine use, 3 hours is more like it.2. The fonts are small and not always easy to increase in size. somewhat limited customization options.3. Slow video processor. Most Youtube or internet video will play fine, but some will not play well or at all. I have compared it side by side with my HP Envy and the Mac appears disabled compared to the Envy. Very limited graphic memory and not upgradable.4. Keyboard feels flimsy. This is subjective, but i feel that the HP envy keypads provide more feedback..6. High initial cost of entry.7. Mac OS- this is subjective and controversial obviously, but i find Window 7 easier to use with more customization options.8. Windows 7 still by far has more compatible accessories and software. There are software that allow dual OS or cross compatibility, but most of them will slow down your computer and they are not necessarily cheap.9. No USB 3.010. The power off button is one of the keys on the keyboard next to Delete and Volume control which means inadvertent power off is not infrequent unless you pay attention to it.11. Unreliable trackpad- beautiful engineering when it works, but is often unreliable and inconsistent. I use my good old mouse every chance i can get.To summarize, it is probably still the best Ultrabook available, but probably not for long. You will like it if you absolutely have to have a Mac ultrabook or you cannot wait another 6 months for better competing models from the PC camp. If don't care for the Mac OS and you can wait for another few months, then i would go for Window 8 Ultrabooks which will likely be available sometime next year. Better yet, if you don't really need an ultrabook, get a real computer.","December 21, 2011",0
laptops,Macbook Air Disappointment,AMMCD,RD3QT1LWGZMMV,3,"I was really disappointed with this item, as it lasted for six hours and the battery died - for good. Unfortunately, I had taken it out of the country at that stage, so I had to leave it into an Apple resellers, who have had it now for almost a week. First day, they did nothing with it, as they were all on a training course. Second day, they ran diagnostics on it which lasted for most of the day. Third day, they decide its the battery (doh!) and place one on order from Apple. All this, and the laptop was only a few days old. They didn't even think to let me know all this. I had to call several times myself. So much for Apple care. I'll be thinking twice before buying Apple. I never had this trouble with a laptop before and I have bought numerous brands, both for myself and my family.","November 10, 2011",0
laptops,Don't Believe the 7hr battery life,Matthew T Atkinson,R23YE3IZBAG2HN,3,"You will not get 7hrs of battery life, even with nothing running and screen dimmed so much you can barely see it. It is more like 5hrs if you are not watching video and you have the brightness turned way down (and that is pushing it). I don't know why Apple say's this thing will get 7hrs. Other than that performance is great and the screen resolution to me is what sets this thing apart from other ultra books. The high screen resolution makes it seem like you are working on a 15.4"" screen. I would give it 4 stars if Apple hadn't misled me about the battery life. If it can get 7 hrs, as they say, then they ought to tell ya exactly what was running and exactly what was installed at the time they got it. Because it is not easily replicable.","November 13, 2011",0
laptops,Not What I was expecting,Brittany Bratton,R2P78G7AGMTMWL,3,"I when I purchased my laptop I was under the thinking that by old version it was the last one released or maybe the one before that. I ended up with a great little 2009 macbook air and a terribly mangled charging cord (wire is exposed at a spot or two). If I had known that at the time I would have not purchased it. Like I said I was expecting a newer version. I also feel like for the condition and age I should not have been as much as I paid. I had contemplated sending it back for a refund, but due to the fact that I am a student and it is mid semester that is next to impossible. Over all if I don't think about the fact that its not what I thought it was, paid to much for it, I had to purchase a new charger, and can't purchase accessories for it due to age it is a great laptop.","February 18, 2014",0

laptops,Switching to OS X from Windows 7 ?,R. Kavuri,R21IAPUYZ0FXQG,3,"Please note that this is a review for the February 2011 model but I am posting it here since the configuration is almost the same. (also because more people could read this before buying a MBP)I have been a Windows user since I started using a computer and I never used a Mac OS X till I actually bought a MBP in May 2011. So, this review would really help someone who is considering a Mac for the first time and wants to use it either at school or to remotely connect to work. This article summarizes what you would love and what you could be missing.I previously owned a desktop, a HP laptop and a Compaq laptop before I bought a MBP. Also, I still use Windows machine at work. One of the major reasons I bought the MBP was because it was available on a eBay deal from Macmall for $950. I assumed that if I did not like it, I could always sell it for at least $850 on eBay or Craigslist.Before reading the next part, please do understand that MBP and OS X come together. Things you need to know --**OS XSwitching between applications - This is one of my biggest quirks with OS X. Windows 7 does an awesome job in switching between applications. When you want to switch between the applications, you use ALT+TAB in Windows 7 and this would shift the focus to the next application. In OS X, you can switch between applications by using CMD+TAB but it does not automatically bring up the other application, it just changes the active application in menu bar (if the application was minimized). I never understood the reasoning behind this, why would I just want to see the menu bar of the other application, I cannot imagine doing anything just with a menu bar.After some search on the internet I found the work around to do this in OS X. The answer is to press CMD+TAB followed by the option key (just before releasing the CMD key) to switch between the applications perfectly. You can also scroll your four fingers on the track pad to bring up all the applications and then highlight the application you want to choose to change the active application window. It is simply irritating to switch between keyboard and the track pad when you are typing some document or email. You can also use one of the function key buttons instead of using the four fingers but at the end of the day Windows 7 does a great job here.Please do note that you can only switch directly between applications but not directly to the active window of an application when you used CMD+TAB, for example you cannot switch directly to a second excel workbook, you have to bring up the application first and only then switch to the second workbook. I am aware that there is software available (namely Witch for $14) to do this but I already paid for the machine and why should I go through all this trouble and change the system registry entries to simply switch between applications.-->UPDATE We can also use spaces and assign some shortcuts to spaces(like option+arrow) to make the switch between applications easier but you need to assign a different space to every application and this could be tedious after some time. Also the animations could make you dizzy after a while.Switching within an application - To switch between the various windows of the same application, the answer is to press CMD+~, it works but what if I have 3 open excel workbooks. Same answer as above, scroll the four fingers or press the function key to see all active windows.Taskbar could be a big deal - It is irritating not to have a task bar in OS X. You can never actually know that you had two open excel workbooks or two separate browser windows at a glance. To put this into context, try working in Windows 7 grouping all your applications together all the time, in Windows 7 the users have the option to ungroup individual windows by selecting ""Combine only when taskbar is full"" in the taskbar properties. The problem with this approach in OS X is that you will never know all the application windows unless you display all the active windows or highlight the application in the docking bar.Also, the docking bar still occupies a substantial amount of screen space even in its minimal size , in Windows 7 the taskbar is comparively small. Due to the screen size and resolution constraints we usually tend to hide this docking bar on the 13"" MBP so that we can see the applications in the maximum available screen space. So either compromise on seeing the active applications in docking bar or full screen mode for applications.Again, the app Witch is the answer for taskbar but it will display these active windows only when we press CMD+TAB.Full Screen - I am addicted to see everything in maximized window mode in Windows 7 machines, I could never be satisfied with the default resized small windows, so I installed a free application RightZoom to address this issue. So far, so good.Microsoft Office - The experience of using Microsoft Office on OS X is pretty subpar in comparison to Windows 7, may be it the fault of Microsoft but it is simply pretty hard for someone to transition from Office 2010 in Windows 7 to Office 2011 in OS X. For example, I am used to zooming in and out of Microsoft Word using Ctrl+Scroll Up(on trackpad) and Ctrl+Scroll Down but this option is not available as shortcut in the OS X version of Office. I wanted to type a formula for a cell in Excel and cannot find the formula bar. May be someone can help me if they know a way around enhancing this experience.Quick Links - The docking bar essentially acts likes the quick link shortcuts in Windows 7. CMD+W closes the application and CMD+Q quits the application, you have to be careful enough not to press Q instead of W.Delete button - There is no substitute to Shift+Delete in OS X(CMD+del). Deletion followed by emptying trash is the only way to do it, if you are someone who is addicted to deleting the file at once there is no shortcut.Cut + Paste - There is no such option as 'Cut+Paste' in OS X. If you want to move something to a different folder, you have to copy and paste the file into the target folder and then delete the original from the source folder. Or select the file and carefully drag the file from the source into the target folder.Preview - Preview can be used to view PDF files and image files. Preview can also be used to make some markings in a PDF file, that is pretty cool. But what if I want to see all the pictures in a folder at once using preview, the only option is to select all the images and then right click to open with preview to see the files (In certain situations we can select all images and press space bar and the photos come in a stream slideshow, I learned this recently. Also, every time you open a PDF or an image file the preview application becomes active, I would have preferred the application to quit automatically when I close the image). In summary, it is easier and cooler in Windows 7 to view images.Software Installation - There is no control panel in OS X. Just drag the file into the trash bin and it is gone. It has traces in your system but essentially it is gone for all practical purposes. I like this easy deletion aspect in OS X.VPN Connection - Certain (or many?) VPN connection softwares like Juniper cannot be installed on OS X because some of these VPN connections connect using some plugins that are designed specifically for Internet Explorer, which is not available on OS X. I wanted to connect to work using the Microsoft Office remote desktop client but could not do it due to this restriction .External Applications - All the applications cannot be installed in OS X. There are lots of companies out there that make products just for Windows machines. I had to install StatTools for my course work and the tool could not be installed on OS X, so I had to work from another Windows machine at work on the weekends for my course work. I could have also installed Bootcamp and that comes up next.Bootcamp - I installed Windows 7 using bootcamp on MBP. I observed that Windows 7 is slow and the hard disk makes squeaky noises when you are trying to open an application in bootcamp, also the track pad experience is not the same despite the various drivers and the keyboard layout is obviously different. You can overcome these problems by connecting the MBP to a HDTV or any monitor and then using a wireless Windows keyboard + mouse but then the whole setup is too much hassle and defeats the purpose of a laptop.Wakeup time - The MBP is pretty fast on this aspectOS X Lion - I am still on Snow Leopard and do not see any reason to upgrade to Lion. In fact I observe that a lot of people want to downgrade to Snow Leopard from Lion due to stability issues. The fixes are on their way but do check for performance before the upgrade.**HARDWARETrack pad - This is something you would love to use and a big selling point, you can never think of going back to other laptops after using this. I always used a mouse on the Windows laptops but never even felt the need for a mouse on the MBP. The two finger swipe to scroll and three finger swipe that replace the 'Home' and 'End' buttons, pinch and zoom for PDF document and images are pretty cool options. I was pretty amazed at the track pad when I started learning more about the OS X.Keyboard - Keys are located spaciously. My previous two laptops frequently had dirt stuck in between the keys which used to drive me crazy.Heat - HP and Compaq laptops generate so much heat that you can use them as a personal heater (I used to do it). The whirring sound made by my Compaq laptop's heat fan used to be pretty embarrassing for me in my class or in the meetings, I hated opening the laptop. In a contrast, the MBP is very calm, the fan does go up occasionally when you run some intensive applications such as office (along with some other intensive applications) or play graphic video games but you will hardly notice it.Build - Unibody aluminum build with just 10 screws at the back is something you would appreciate only when you have used other laptops made of plastic material that make creaky sounds every time you lift them. The upper lid of these other plastic material laptops tend to wobble a lot over time but the MBP's lid is pretty stiff even after 7 months of daily use (at least 3 hours a day).Screen - I personally like the fact there is no slight gap between the glossy screen and border of the lid. In other laptops dust gets stuck between the screen and the plastic and it could be really irritating when you cannot remove the dust. Screen quality, there are different manufacturers for the LCD screen, please search for 9CC3, 9CC5 and 9CC7 to know more about this. I have a 9CC3 (luckily) and it is supposed to be the best one available for a 13"" MBP.Ports - HDMI port is not available directly but you can buy a 10 feet long HDMI output cable for less than $20.DVD Drive - Other laptops tend to have DVD drive as an attachment but in a MBP it is inseparable (at least by the looks of it). The DVD drives on the two other laptops I owned before MBP used to make a quirky sound when I used to wake them up from sleep or do a restart, no such sounds on the MBP.Battery - The longest battery life out I could extract from MBP was about 6 hours with browsing. That is pretty good considering that other cheaper laptops can only last for 2.5 hours. Of course you can upgrade your battery on the other laptops but you need to compromise on the weight.Power Chord and Charger - One of my friends accidentally tripped over a $1000 Sony Vaio's power chord and the machine fell on the floor with brute force. I still remember how anxious he was till the machine powered up. This would not happen with a MBP, the chord attaches to the MBP with magnet, in case of an accident the power chord would detach itself and nothing would still happen to the MBP. The adapter is light weight and you can carry it in a backpack (no big bundles like the ones you see for HP and Dell).Function Keys - I use the function keys in Windows 7 machines to close application, essentially which means that I am going to just use F4 for pressing Ctrl+F4 or Alt+F4. I like the Apple's way of function keys, pretty easy to use and only contains what we exactly need. Ctrl+F4 and Alt+F4 are replaced by CMD+W in OS X.Webcam - 720p & perfect for Skype.Backlit Keyboard - If you have not used one before you will love this option.Resale Value - Based on the eBay listings I can say that you could expect to recover 75% of the actual value of a MBP if you maintain it well (if sold within a year of purchase).Apple Warranty - International warranty for 1 year + easy replacement within 3 months + Apple protection for 3 years for $200 (warranty is international again) is really worth it. I felt that my battery was losing its power quickly and Apple Store promptly replaced the battery for me.Cons (the only one)Speakers Sound - Sound is kind of low for me, I really wish that it was louder.So to summarize I am impressed with the hardware by every bit and I really do not have any complaints about the hardware design.******************************************************************************In conclusion, if you are going to use your laptop for Microsoft Office and want to connect to Windows machine through Remote Desktop or VPN, I would recommend not to jump the boat to OS X and instead consider other alternatives listed below. The experience of Microsoft Office, switching between applications and productivity is much better on Windows 7. I am going to still try to adapt to Office 2011 in OS X and if that does not work out I would consider the other Ultrabooks.I would still recommend a MBP if you want to buy a laptop for casual browsing and simple applications at home, the hardware design is pretty awesome.Alternatives to consider - Similar hardware design with Windows 7 would be a very good combination and that brings me to Windows Ultrabooks. Ultrabooks are about the same price (or in most of the cases cheaper than MBP), faster with a SSD and are very appealing with Windows 8 soon on the cards. I read on tech websites that HP Envy Spectre 14, Lenovo U300S, Asus Zenbook, HP Folio 13, Dell XPS and Samsung Series 9 are pretty well built like a MBP but run on Windows 7. Currently, HP Envy Spectre 14 has got the best reviews of all the ultrabooks as of now and Asus is about to release their second iteration of zenbooks soon, so thats some good news if you are a Windows fan.","February 23, 2012",0
laptops,Over rated in my opinion,SAH,R2FT68G6RYR4WK,3,"In my opinion this laptop is kind of over-rate. Let me first state that I had a lot of expectation from a Mac not because there is something wrong with me, but because Apple has through its advertisement made it look like the best laptop out there. If I have to sum this laptop in one word, I would say ""track pad"". Nothing else on this laptop is exceptional. The uni body is good but you will find yourself protecting the scratch prone body more than enjoying it.Also, I want to make it clear that I am not an Apple hater, although I don't see why it should be a problem. I own an iPhone 4S and an iPad 2 and I am totally enjoying them.I will list the pros and cons.Pros:Looks good.Track pad is the best out there.Cons:Fan makes noise.The bottom gets very hot.Hard disk makes the same read-write noises that it makes on other cheap ones.OS is not all that good after all. It is still trying to catch up with Windows in many ways. Windows 7 is a much better OS in my opinion.I think in the end it comes down to the fact that if you spend as much money on a Windows laptop as you do on a MacBook Pro you would never feel the need to shift to a mac and I am going to do just that.At the same time, I will re-consider buying a Mac again when OS X is well groomed and when Macbook gives value for money spent on it. Right now, it behaves like any other laptop in terms on fan noise, heating and does not justify the $1100 point mark.","April 5, 2012",0
laptops,Third time lucky,DarkMystique,ROTMBPQZ9OTJB,3,"I had trouble with the original product, got it exchanged - problems with static and audio issues again and then finally got a 3rd replacement which was ok. Glad I bought it off Amazon and not directly from Apple - better price, no tax, and replacement was a breeze.Not too happy with the Macbook itself - This is my second Mac and not as good as my 1st one. It can't process quickly enough, battery gets drained out quicker (plus the unibody is a pain), and hangs pretty often.Guess Appleis concentrating on advancing technologies for the iphones and iPads...not so much the macbooks.","January 18, 2013",0
laptops,Good for media consumption and creation...,T. Nield,R3M99ZWISX968T,3,"I've been working on an iPad app for five months on this Macbook Pro. I will come forth and admit I've traditionally been a PC person and I appreciate the flexible environments it offers for businesses, programmers, and developers as well as providing tools to create complex business-geared applications. Mac OS X, as pleasant as it is to use, has such a controlled experience to the point it dampens technical creativity. I can't help but compare the MacBook to a game console like the Xbox or PS3. It restricts your activities to just consuming media rather than creating anything with the exception of movies, music, and visual publications. Granted Microsoft Office did get re-released for Mac OS X, it still condones an environment of massive media consumption and consumer amusement rather than productivity. I understand that was the intent though. Apple wanted to create an experience that they defined and controlled to keep the user experience streamlined. But Apple is out to solve people's personal problems and create consumer amusement, not solve the technical problems of the world businesses faces every day. It's a cruel irony that Apple claims to unleash people's creativity but then turns around and dictates everything the user cannot do. I am not allowed to make an app without a $100 fee and an approval process conducted by them, and I certainly cannot explore the technical beauty of Apple technology that they have so securely locked down.The tools to create programs on Mac OS X and iOS were a major disappointment to me. I really wanted Apple XCode to be pleasant to use so I could pursue making mobile apps on my own time, but it was like programming in the 1990's. Everything about Objective-C is so archaic and dated, and Apple knows this as it scrambles producing massive updates that completely overhaul the coding patterns every three months. If you buy a book on Apple programming, you can expect to have a nice paperweight within three months. The debugging tools are a nightmare and unless you are a hardcore C programmer do not expect this to be some nice, shiny Visual Studio-esque IDE. Although each massive update to Xcode adds new features that improves the coding experience (like ARC garbage collection, praise Jesus!), the obsolescence of prior coding paradigms creates massive headaches for programmers. Apple is so far behind when it comes to serving developers' needs because every app and line of code was done in-house by Apple until recently. They had to open up iOS a little and let non-Apple employees make apps.In summary, Apple makes consumer products and consumer solutions, not enterprise or developer. Do not buy a Macbook expecting it will help you be productive especially in enterprise or business settings.

A year after purchase, dropped laptop 2 feet onto carpet and screen cracked, took it in for repair and found out cable that connects screen to base also in poor shape (apparently a common problem with this laptop per computer repair place), so after 1 yr use had to replace laptop. Expected more for the money I spent. Disappointed in the issues. Acer customer service won't even talk to you if past product warranty. Very disappointed with this purchase!!

laptops,Acer or Samsung Chromebook? Read This Before Deciding ...,Consumer Advocate,R2W4CDEWUPU8UQ,3,"Having spent some time comparing the Samsung and Acer, I found the Acer much better in the following areas:1. The Acer has removable battery that doesn't require you to disassemble your computer. There are 3, 6, and 9-cell capacity batteries to choose from. A fully charged one can be swapped in in seconds, just like ordinary notebook computers. The Samsung has a sealed battery inside (see ifixit.com) that cannot be replaced by anyone but Samsung. I cannot find a replacement battery for it on Ebay.2. The 2 Gb RAM in the Acer is removable, whereas the memory in the Samsung is SOLDERED in. In the event that it fails, you'd need to take it to Samsung for repair. You can imagine how much it will cost (parts + labor + shipping cost) compared to replacing the RAM yourself, not to mention lost time waiting. Because of this, ifixit only rated this Samsung's repairability at 6 out of 10.3. The Acer has a much better webcam at 1.3 Megapixels. Acer puts this excellent webcam, which it calls Crystal Eye, in almost all of its notebooks. It has excellent resolution and color fidelity. Samsung just says it has a 1 megapixel webcam and there is no further information that can be found.4. The Acer has HDMI output so your Chromebook can be connected to a large screen TV for viewing. The HDMI interface carries both audio and video signals in digital format. The Samsung just has an analog VGA connector, which is for video only! You need to run another cable for audio. Give me a break! I cannot understand why Samsung would put in this archaic interface on an advanced notebook like this in 2011!5. The Acer has a better a display at 1366 X 768 resolution (true 16:9 aspect ratio), compared to Samsung's 1280 X 800.In addition, you can read all the reviews on the Internet and watch YouTube videos comparing the two. Most agree that the Acer is superior and at a lower price ($299 for Wi-Fi, or $399 for Wi-Fi + 3G). Nonetheless, very few pointed out the fact about the Samsung's non-user-serviceable battery and memory, or the superiority of Acer's HDMI connector over the Samsung's VGA connector.Update:For the technically inclined, you can get something very similar to the Chromebook by running the Chrome OS on a USB stick with your PC or Mac. Just search for ""chrome os lime"" on Google. It requires downloading the Chrome OS image and burning it onto the USB drive using an image writer. It's not difficult. The boot time is about 15 seconds and the entire computer runs really fast, not as good as a Chromebook, but pretty close, and it's free! You should also know that Chrome OS Lime is updated DAILY and its compatibility is very computer brand and model specific. Even with BIOS that has ""boot from USB"" capability, computers older than two or three years probably can't run. If you have Compaq CQ62-423NR, I can tell you that Lime works (sound, touchpad, Adobe Flash, Wi-Fi, webcam, etc.).If you want to easily track your interests on the Internet on a daily basis, I'd suggest yourversion.com. It will track each keyword that you specify, for example, ""chrome os"", and it will present the latest info about it in a list of websites. It's more convenient than Google search. There are mobile versions for iOS and Android as well.","December 20, 2011",0
laptops,Did not meet expectations,Daniel Genzink,R13K66QOVBUDR0,3,"I love gmail, chrome, and everything google does. Knowing that I was purchasing a machine that focused completely around chrome, I'm just a tad letdown.Here are just some observations while using the product over the past week.Hardware: the size and weight is great. inputs and outputs are adequate. However, for a machine that ""gets better over time"" as google advertises, the hardware may be limiting. It's a solid casing, so there's no way to install a new battery or carry an extra one for backup. Also, it's a standard plug from the power cord to the computer (not magnetic), so that will ware out over time, especially if you're trying to get the most out of the battery by unplugging it when it's completely charged.Some people have mentioned that there is no caps lock key, but that's not a big deal. (who uses that anyway?) The only key I miss is the Delete key, for when I want to delete characters in-front of the cursor.streaming video: I watch mlb.tv and other live sports online and it works quite well.web browsing: I'll have 3 or 4 tabs open and 3 or 4 extensions running (google voice, google talk, scratch pad) and I'll get a notification that one of the extensions has crashed or I'll get that ""he's dead jim"" blue screen when a chrome web page crashes. This is happening about 2 or more times a day.File management: I plugged in a usb thumb drive with a bunch of different files and it only recognized pictures. So, I couldn't open up a word doc directly from the thumb drive; you have to go to google docs and then open it from there. I also can't find web app that will play avi video files from the thumb drive.Battery: as we all know, the battery life is great. When the battery is dead and you begin charging, it says it will take about 3 hours to charge. However, even when the computer is completely powered down, the final ""20 minutes"" takes a little over an hour, so it's about 3.5 hours for a charge. Because I watch a lot of video, I'm not sure how long it lasts for normal use, but right now it says the battery has 4% left and 2 hrs; this makes no sense.Processing power: If this is a machine that is supposed to get better over time, I believe the processing power will be the limiting factor. Having an HD sports program in the background while doing something else isn't the smoothest of operations. As apps become more advanced in the future and need more processing power, I'm not sure how the chromebook will hold up.That being said, if you want the portability, long battery life, and quick access to the web, this is a great machine.Let me know if you have any questions by leaving a comment.Thanks!Dan.","June 27, 2011",0

laptops,interesting...,"R. Robinson ""Dharma Keeper""",R2WO0O8MF79IT0,3,"Amazon and best buy will starting saling the chromebook on June 15th...However, I expect prices to drop considerably within the first 3 months...just to damn pricey! First, I am a test pilot user and find the product refreshing and highly useful. But I just dont know why Google didnt go ahead and offer a tablet version and 2 or 3 netbook versions (a wifi and a 3g, which should be a 4g) instead of the 5 netbook versions? People want tablets! Besides, it would do what android tablets havent been able to do. Also, android and its marketplace are at a critical junction with the fragmentation that is occurring, sure to cause consternation both in the consumer and the developer world, as its lifespan continues.Most important for Chrome OS survivability is the fact that web and software developers will have to tailor and support their programs for Chrome, which will take a while but undeniably will happen, once the popularity of the OS and cloud computing usage in general increases, but first a price drop for these devices; Google must get them into the hands of everyone with a couple of extra dollars in their pockets and the desire to find a new OS (which there are many of), even if it means doing it at a loss (see: the kindle). Eventually Google is going to run into the classic ""guns versus butter"" quandary with all its operating systems out there. Ill place my money on its ONLY TRUE OPEN OS, the Chrome OS (android is by invite only until Google decides to release version's source code). Chrome is more than just a browser, any browsing on goggle labs will convince you of that! So why not capitalize on its unified design/operating concept and install it as an OS? This is what many people dont ""get about Chrome as an OS, the say ""I have chrome on my computer already""...in a few years pretty much all of your operations will exist in/on the cloud.SOME GOOD: All of the chromebooks weigh in at about 3lbs, or twice the wight of the ipad2, which is still very light. Also, battery life is pretty identical to the advertised specs. Boot time is ridiculously fast, less than 10 secs from a dead sleep! Amazon's cloud player is integrated very, very nicely integrated. Most important Chrome OS function: you DONT have to pay for web applications as you do with iOS or Android OS (unless site owners wish to charge for content, that is).SOME BAD: No HDMI but a VGA instead (yeah, I know, its 2011). No bluetooth, NO GPS, webcam issues, cant use USB drives...most of the issues (I did not list several others) can be patched through updates. However some are hardware and will need to be addressed next production run or model design. I recommend any of the SAMSUNG chromebooks w/the dual core Atom n570 cpu.The cpu will cut down significantly on streaming video stuttering that the acer chromebook will see (only the acer wifi only version has the N570, but a smaller screen though; as of June 2011 pay the few extra dollars and get the Samsung 3g unit... On a final note: I almost wish I hadnt bought my ipad2, but I got tired of waiting for the chromebook to release and needed a portable computing device(I dont use windows netbook/laptops or Mac's. I will however grudgingly settle for chrome on a netbook). I suppose now I can now wait for chrome OS to be released on a tablet before letting go of the ipad; hopefully a Chrome OS tablet will come before xmas.","May 11, 2011",0

laptops,Can't track this,Joshua Hadley,R2110ZX1MJ4Z4B,3,"It's difficult to separate a review of a Chromebook from a review of ChromeOS, but I'll try to stick to the hardware aspects as much as possible.For the most part, it is a cheap plastic laptop. It is nice and thin, but feels pretty flimsy. The display is OK, not awesome, but doesn't suck either. I don't like the keyboard; I'm always mis-typing keys. The power supply cable worries me a bit: the pin is very small and the whole thing does not feel like it quite fits right. The worst is the trackpad, and I'm not sure how much of this is software or hardware/driver but it is absolutely terrible. No amount of adjusting the sensitivity seems to get it to feel right; the cursor is jumpy, scrolling is erratic, etc. I'd say, if you like a large screen and don't care about quality too much, then this might be the product for you. But if you prefer a better build quality and don't care so much about size, you might consider a different netbook as you could get one for right around the same price point.I'll leave the review of ChromeOS for someone else/someplace else but I would definitely advise anyone getting a Chromebook to make sure they understand the differences between the ChromeOS ""the system is a browser"" approach versus a traditional operating system...you may be in for some surprises.","July 26, 2011",0
laptops,spoiled by Apple; cheap box for $500,Ed FitzGerald,R121W9RT5JL5I2,3,"I am a Google Head. Brought Google Apps for Ed to my school in Fall of 2006. But after using Apple devices, I'm having a hard time liking Samsung's idea of a Chromebook.For one, I was expecting a sub-$400 price for these - after all there's no MS WIndows driving up the price. I've bought a number of Netbooks over the years and felt they were starting to be a nice device - so I had high hopes for this.But it feels heavier than I expected, there's no keyboard back-light, and the body, especially around the screen hinge is cheap snap-to plastic. But the thing that really rags me the most is the trackpad - I can't tap it to click, I have to press down and click it. Even my $275 Acer netbooks had tap to click.And I can't imagine this holding up for 3 years with a junior high student.And Chrome OS is Chrome - there's not much more to it (file explorer). So $500 to run only Chrome...Update: I was wrong on the tapping the tackpad - for some reason the setting was off by default (weird that when I received the Samsung WiFi only Chromebook it was on by default)Just got Acer Chroembook today. Feels more solid. Screen is smaller/shorter (766px vs 800px vertical) but Samsung is not worth $79 more when buying 20 for a class of kids.","June 21, 2011",0
laptops,Must have appropriate expectations,mjkelly,R2DXGRRR7DTM73,3,"If you buy this product you need to realize what it is you are purchasing. This is not a fully-featured computer. It is not a traditional netbook. It is something different. If you buy it without knowing these things, you are likely to disappointed. So what can it do?1. It can do anything that can be done in a web browser. The OS really is just chrome. If you want to see how you like this, download chrome on your existing computer, and try using it for everything for a little while. Any files that require other applications will only work if you can find a webapp for that purpose.2. It CAN store files locally. Common misconception here. It has 16GB of local storage. This isn't a lot, but does allow you to take files with you without having to put them ""in the cloud."" Of course, you still can't edit google documents while offline...3. It gets about 5-6 hours of battery life. The original models got 8 hours, but when they cut the price they removed some of the capability as well.4. It can start up in about 8 seconds. This well-marketed feature worked as advertised.5. It can connect to external displays ONLY if you purchase the proprietary mini VGA adapter, which will run you another 30 bucks or so.

However, it has an annoying problem of going into power saving mode and not coming back if you touch it at the wrong time. I'll attach the bug report (15550585) I submitted to Apple. They closed the report since they said it was a duplicate of another bug report (15556091):Summary:On any mid-2013 MBA (11"" or 13""), when system is idle long enough to dim the display/go to sleep, the screen fades to black. If the user tries to prevent sleep by tapping a key or trackpad, the system hangs with a black screen. The CAPS LOCK key toggles on/off when pressed, but no other user input seems to do anything. Closing the screen and reopening has no effect. Only a hard boot will bring system back. The happens whether on battery or plugged in. Any unsaved documents/code files are lost.Steps to Reproduce:1. Let system idle and wait for display to dim (based on power settings).2. Wait a couple more seconds for screen to go black.3. Wait a split second more for keyboard backlight to begin to fade.4. Before keyboard backlight is completely off, press a key or swipe the trackpad (as if trying to prevent the system from sleeping, thus requiring re-entry of password)Expected Results:I would expect the system to wake up and let me continue with what I was doing.Actual Results:When touching the input as the keyboard backlight is fading, the backlight illuminates brightly, but the screen stays black. The CAPS LOCK key will toggles its light on/off. No other action will wake up the system. Only a hard boot will bring system back on.Version:My personal machine is a mid-2013 MBA, 11"", 256GB SSD, 8GB RAM, i7 chip, currently running Mavericks, but issue first noticed out-of-box running Mountain Lion.Notes:I brought my MBA to an Apple Store on 11/2/2013 and demonstrated the behavior to a ""genius"" with my configuration running Mavericks and when booting to Apple's ""known good"" environment running Mountain Lion.

laptops,One Loose Key,sara alexander vinson,R1H3R94SN4URPF,3,"My only disappointment with this laptop was that it came with a loose keyboard key. The nearest Mac store is over an hour away which is why ordered the laptop online. However, I'm now going to have to make the trip to the store anyways to get the key fixed. The warranty should cover the repair, otherwise I would have sent the laptop back for a replacement. It seems like better quality control (a quick look over before sending a product out) would help avoid irritating situations like this.","April 5, 2013",0
laptops,Not as impressed as I thought I'd be,ocean78,R3NYLTXJ2RVMKI,3,"I have been working primarily on PC's with GNU/linux since 2006. My company bought me the Apple Macbook Pro MD101LL/A 13.3-Inch laptop because I have to build some mobile applications with XCode.Coming from Ubuntu, I quickly learned that the Apple developer world is not as well-supported by applications I commonly use such as wine for running Windows software. An application I've been running on Wine in Ubuntu does not run on OSX. There's Virtualbox but not VMWare player. My favorite desktop editor Geany is not available on OSX and a lot of the better text editors are expensive. Running Ubuntu in Virtualbox in OSX is pretty fast so that's what I've been doing to get my real work done. Also, can't get Terminator (probably the best terminal application in existence on OSX). Boo hoo.There is some software that it's nice to finally have a chance to try out like Unity3D and there are more games available on Steam, not that I have a lot of time to play them right now.The laptop case seems pretty sturdy but the keys seem like they're designed to pop off. They feel flimsy and this surprised me. Also, I hate not having a right mouse button click implemented on the touchpad.If you have to use OSX or you're worried about what people will think of you if you don't have an Apple than this is the laptop for you. Otherwise you can get a comparable laptop for 60 - 70% of the price and put Ubuntu on it and have a better offering of free software and a more robust developer environment.","April 21, 2013",0
laptops,Apple products use to be more reliable,J. Dionne,R3I9ZF5K63715Y,3,"After using this MacBook Pro for a little over thirty days, I have lost complete access to my very expensive (by comparison) notebook.The notebook worked well for roughly 30 days after I received the MacBook, installed all the updates Apple Store informed me to install and Apple's ""Parallels"" Windoze bridge VM to read/create Word/Excel documents. Then, after an Apple Store update, the system started panicking during a normal ""Shutdown."" I submitted all ""reports"" the MacBook Pro asked I booted back up for about a week.Then, after yet another panic during shutdown the MacBook Pro was rebooted, the user and passwords prompt would no longer recognize ASCII keyboard characters, i.e. a-Z, A-Z, 0-9, etc. It would, however, allow me to enter Ctr-A through Ctrl-Z, and Alt-A through Alt-Z, just not A-Z and numeric keyboard keys are not be recognized. I opened a Apple Support ticket, but they are clueless, with two representatives provided divergent advise.I don't know if I just got a lemming, or if this is a know BUG in Apple OSX. The only good comments I can say about Apple Support is that they immediately take inbound calls and keep to their call back schedules. The bad news, they seem unable to correct any but the most simplest, generic issues like a novice computer user's question as to ""where the any key"" is located. (I am a thirty year plus hardware, network and software engineer.)*UPDATE*05-19-2013: After spending my entire Saturday either talking with a CS rep or downloading an update from Apple I can report that Apple technical support was able to fix my issue. The exact cause of the failure remains elusive, but after being escalated up to higher, more experienced technicians I am once again happily using my Macbook Pro. Stuff happens and it is never fun when it happens to ourselves, but with patience and persistence one shall always prevail.","May 18, 2013",0
laptops,Over estimated laptop.,Songhai,R2KK2EHR71P56J,3,"The rave reviews on this laptop pushed my expectations way out of this world.I am comparing it with my Toshiba laptop.1.It is not faster than my 3 years old Toshiba Satellite E205 S1904 Laptop which cost me $100.00 less.2.The Keyboard of my Toshiba is as responsive as the keyboard of the Mac Pro, if not better.3.The Toshiba Keyboard is better lit than the Keyboard of the Mac Pro.The Mac Pro lit key board is just showmanship.Light is reflected around the edges of the letters and not through the letters as in the Toshiba.4.My Toshiba weighs 5Ibs and the Mac Pro is listed as weighing 4.5Ibs, yet the Toshiba feels lighter.5.My Toshiba laptop does not keep stains while the Mac Pro laptop is a stain attractant.6.My Toshiba is cooler than the Mac Pro when left running for hours.7.My Toshiba laptop is as quiet as the Mac Pro but when the Mac Pro revs up the fan speed, my Toshiba is quieter.My only pros for the Mac Pro are :1.Longer battery life of 6+ hours while the Toshiba is 2.5hours.2.I do not play video games but I hear that the Mac Pro is good for gaming.Though I have not checked it out, I give this point to Mac Pro.3.No need for antivirus software as opposed to my windows 7 based Toshiba laptop which has one.The Mac Pro is a decent laptop but not an extra ordinary laptop as these reviews would want you to believe.I am giving it a 3 stars because I do not think it surpasses my Toshiba laptop which I rate as 4 stars (-1 star for very short battery life of 2.5hrs).","July 29, 2013",0
laptops,surprisingly disappointed,chanti,R2Y6VMTIV4ENV8,3,"While there are things I love about this computer - the screen and the speed - I have been surprisingly disappointed. It is really heavy for a laptop, I keep having to ring tech support for bits that are crashing and no longer working, I don't find it very user friendly (though final cut pro really is!), and strangest of all, it's too hot to have on your lap!!! I'm sure part of my ongoing dissatisfaction around the lack of ease to use is that I am no longer used to Mac's having been on pc for ages, but most of the problems listed above are not related to this shift. I guess I expected to be wowed and I am missing my pc. Never wanted to have to say that about an apple product. And I certainly won't be jumping to an Air, as that has no memory and the lightness of the model seems thwarted by having to carry around and external hard drive - as my friend who has one needs to.","May 22, 2013",0
laptops,Gets hot. Occasionally very loud fan noise.,Mark Twain,R3GQGRQEJPQV9I,3,"Beautiful display, fast but sometimes it gets very hot at bottom. Also sometimes very loud fan noise comes but it is very quite otherwise. In a meeting, noise gets so loud that everyone started noticing it. Other than that it feels great.Coming from windows, I am not impressed with mac versions of Outlook and excel. Also I find windows explorer much better than its counter-part on mac but these things could be learning curve (I believe it's not)Somethings to note- You need to use adapter for Eathernet or VGA monitor. Standard cables will not work otherwise.- You can not lock using laptop lock which I could do in my laptop.- You should expect costly accessories such as $70+ for extra power adapter, $60+ for apple keyboard or mouse. Though you should be able to use other standard mouse or keyboard.Somethings to be proud off- Retina display is awesome (not sure about IR issue I read in reviews)- Mic and speakers seem to be of very good quality- Key-board light is great for working at night- Mac OS seems to be goodUpdate on 2/19I took it to apple store and reported the issue.

laptops,Not worth the money unless you need a mac for work,AK529,RHNSOQ3WI8UPT,3,"This was my first mac purchase. Ive always wanted one but never could afford one. I decided to try this one out because of its superior build quality, better battery life, amazing screen, great apple support and how light and thin it is. I tried two macbooks that were idenical and they both had the same issues. The main issue or defect I had was that there was a creaking/clicking noise coming from the right corner next to the touchpad. Initially I thought I would just make an appointment with a mac genius and get the issue resolved either by a replacement or repair. As I used the macbook pro retina more I found more and more things I just didnt like that were not defects. I use my laptop mostly at my desk connected to my 32 inch samsung led tv as a monitor and wirless keyboard and mouse. When I hooked up the macbook to my tv via hdmi I found that there were ony 2 modes. One mode was mirror and the other was extending the desktop using both screens. I was used to using my tv as a monitor with my previous windows pcs by disabling the laptop screen and just using the tv screen. There was no way to do this with the macbook. I googled and googled and went on forums. There were a few workarounds like placing magnet over the left speaker grill to disable the internet screen or closing the clam shell of the macbook. I wasnt happy with these solutions. These solutions required the macbook to connected to power source and I had to initiate it every time turned on the macbook. I was surprised that a $2400 device could not do what my windows laptop which cost a fraction of it could do. Another thing that continued to annoy me about the macbook was the power adapter. I found it disconnect very easily from the macbook even if I didnt put that much pressure or pull too much. At first this was a defect or that I was missing something. I tried another macbook and also asked on the forums and found this was just normal. Both of the macbooks I got had the LG screen which wasnt suppose as good as the Samsung screen. The macbook also didnt work with samsung laser printer. I tried many drivers. The macbook did however work with my logitech wireless mouse and keyboard. I found the macbook speakers to be very flat sounding when compared to my current lenovo y580. The macbook also got very warm even with light tasks and hot extremely hot when gaming with civ 5 or even just more intensive tasks. I also found the fan to be fairly noisey on the macbook. On the good side the screen was aboustley stunning and battery life was also very good. The macbook was very light and thin and great looking. I also really like that the macbook had dedicated shortcut keys like: volume, music controls, brightness, keyboard brigtness, etc. The keyboard was extremely easy to type on and the best laptop keyboard I have ever used. I really liked the keyboard backlight brightness controls and the fact that I could set it switch off after a certain amount of time and use the light sensor to set the brightness. I also really liked the touchpad which was very smooth and easy to use with tons gestures. It was almost like using a touchscreen. I was disappointed with the mac app store. Considering it has been out for over 2 years now. I found it to be very limited and apps were extremely expensive. Windows 8 already has more apps and more commonly used ones and most of them are free. Overall the macbook was great but there were many little things that I mentioned which I just didnt expect to have issues with. Since I only use my laptop for browsing, email, youtube, gaming with civ 5. I would recommend this macbook to people who really need it for work like for photo editing, movie editing, web design, app designers, etc. My lenovo y580 That I purchased for less than half the price of the macbook is faster and is fully up gradable. I found the lack graphics card options with macbook disappointing. My y580 has double the vram and much better graphics card. I can also replace the battery, hard drive and ram whenever I like on my own.","March 17, 2013",0

laptops,ASUS A53E - Expect to spend extra for a decent wireless network adapter,"tao spirit ""tao_spirit""",R9KF6JSR7S87W,3,"Update - 06/21/2013I finally found a solution to losing my wireless signal. It turns out there is a rash of Atheros AR9485 wireless network adapter cards that are BAD.SOLUTION: Purchase an Intel Centrino Advanced-N 6230 Wifi Half Mini Wireless Plug-In Card Data Transfer Rate 300 Bps. COST: $39.99 from Amazon with free shipping. I just received and installed mine 2 days ago, and staying connected has been a breeze! So if you've already purchased this laptop, are seeing the same problems with connectivity, and can't afford to mail it back to the manufacturer for loss of time and efforts, all you need to do is replace this tiny little 1""x1.5"" card. Go here for further details: http://justtechtips.com/posts/solve-atheros-ar9485-wireless-connection-issues-in-asus-a53e-laptop/-----------------------------------Everything you've read about the speakers is true. They are HORRIFIC! That said, this laptop has been a lifesaver in many respects. It holds its own as I have been a Web Design student for the past several months, which means I have multiple programs opened at once, and there is seldom a hitch. When there is a hitch, it's usually Adobe Dreamweaver that coughs up a fur ball and suddenly dies. So be sure to save your work, no matter what it is, and keep backing up your stuff whenever you can!I've had this laptop for almost 6 months now and have noticed it has a problem holding a wireless signal. (See update above) This is true for both DSL and U-Verse with an INID box newly installed on the side of my house today! The third, and perhaps final technician from my ISP has suggested we purchase a wireless signal booster. The second technician said an INID box would not help, and was correct....but I digress. I do believe something is awry with the wireless network adapter, but I am hesitant to contact ASUS after what I've read about having to send my laptop in. No can do right now. I'm in the middle of school! So, six months in, I might be forced to replace the network adapter myself, but will wait for further signs of mayhem before I do. That said, you're pretty much getting what you pay for with this product. Don't expect miracles. If this is all you can afford right now, go for it. I had to barter for mine because times are tight right now and I didn't even have the cash available for the purchase.There is a keyboard cover plate that is flimsy, and I doubt I'll be able to pound away on this keyboard for too many years (as I did with my HP Pavilion laptop- 6 yrs!), but my old HP laptop became too sluggish for web design and just couldn't handle the demands of multiple browser windows being open along with Adobe Photoshop and Dreamweaver activity, and Microsoft Word activity all at once. Hope this helps.","January 9, 2013",0
laptops,you should know a couple things...,Monica,RPZSS1NC67Y2Q,3,"I have 2 problems with this computer right out of the box. First, the images Amazon shows for the exterior of the black model are actually of a matte brown variation not sold by Amazon. The interior shots are correct with the brushed aluminum, but the exterior is actually a glossy black with a pattern of grey rectangle outlines. I personally hate patterns on a laptop and do not feel that this specific pattern goes well with the aluminum interior. I'm really annoyed at Amazon for making this error.Second, the mouse buttons with the trackpad are really loud. I'm not a tech person, but I'm pretty sure it's the actual mechanism making the clicking (not the hardware) which means I can't fix it. It's an annoying sound to me and I'm sure it would be to everyone else around me as well.I will say that the inside looks really sleek with the aluminum, black keys, and vibrant display. And Amazon delivered the computer 2 days after I ordered (using standard shipping) which is impressive. But I haven't gone in to really use the computer because I'm still debating if those 2 problems are deal breakers.","May 9, 2012",0
laptops,freezes up and has audio problems,Christopher Watts,R1NEBMCTTP09TT,3,"Pros: Great graphics and great CPU.Cons: While either playing a video game or simply browsing online, the mouse cursor will suddenly begin flickering. Several second later the screen will either go completely white or the screen will freeze. You cannot ctrl+alt+del out of this. Your only option is to restart the computer. This happens once per day at random times.Secondly, as another reviewer mentioned, it has audio problems. If you start anything that wants to play a sound, you never know if it's going to play back through the headphones or the laptop speakers. Sometimes it even plays through both! You have to be on guard constantly - ready to either instantly mute the video or mp3 you want to play to gauge the sound or be ready to quickly unplug and replug in the speakers as that is the only way to remedy this problem.These two items severely impair the functioning of the computer. Nice graphics? Nice CPU? I don't care how powerful it is if the computer is going to annoy me and jeopardize my work. I could lose unsaved work in open files quite easily. I will never be able to do my programming work on this computer because of this.","December 1, 2012",0

laptops,Faulty battery and/or battery life,"dk3stl ""Dan""",R2PQ16F1JSZ7Q2,3,"This chromebook worked as advertised except for the battery life - - during normal usage, I would get sometimes 2 hours, or 1.5, or 3.5 hours... the indicator would show 60% left only to have a low battery warning pop up 15 minutes later. So, I think the indicator was off, or the battery was bad, or perhaps battery life is more like 2-3 hours, not 6-8 hours.Samsung customer service was *not* helpful - - I emailed/submitted help requests three times but received no response or support beyond the automated acknowledgment.Other than that, the chromebook worked well, it is small and light, and I like the concept of not having to do any maintenance or updates or virus scans. A strength of the concept is that you can do 90% of everything you typically need to do with it. However, that other 10% is important, e.g. no itunes is a bummer.

laptops,Does not work well with Hulu and other video sites; otherwise terrific,Jon,R1CO0MS69YRKMA,3,"Let me begin by saying that I love my chromebook. I have a 3-month old Macbook Pro that I paid over $3K for, but I consistently pick up my chromebook instead because it is just faster at booting and shutting down, and it has AMAZING all day battery life. If you mostly use your computer for surfing the web, and if you trust Google with your information, then there is nothing better for you than a chromebook.But there is one caveat. Specifically, the chromebook does not work well with video sites like hulu and netflix. The problem is best illustrated by hulu. For example, when you watch a video on hulu there are intermittent video advertisements. The problem with the chromebook is that it cannot recover the video feed for the video after the commercial ends. The audio is there, but the video is not. This occurs every single time an advertisement is played. The only way to fix it is to refresh the browser. This is more than a little annoying, and renders the hulu website useless.Google needs to fix this problem now. Melissa Daniels, the honcho at Google for all things chromebook, I'm dedicating this review to you. Please fix this problem. Other than this one issue, the chromebook is an outstanding product that I highly recommend.**Update - 6/20/2012**I have noticed that the chromebook is frequently unable to load webpages I request. For example, I will type in the URL for cnn and the browser will just churn and will never open the requested webpage. After a few *minutes* of waiting I get an error message saying the browser cannot resolve the DNS for the requested webpage. The chromebook does this even when it is connected directly by ethernet to the router. Also, this is a frequent problem that happens every single day.Hopefully Google can fix this and the other problem associated with the chromebook being useless with popular video streaming sites like hulu. If these issues are not resolved by the time my 30 day return window approaches, I will be returning this item to amazon for a refund.**Update - 6/28/2012**My Amazon return window closes tomorrow, so, it is decision time. Video websites like hulu still do not work well. Lots of other people are complaining about this problem, but Google does not appear to have done anything to correct it.The network connection issue also remains a problem. I have sat my Macbook beside my chromebook and the chromebook has dropped the network connection repeatedly when the Macbook did not. I think this is a hardware problem inherent to the chromebook, but I am not sure.A new problem has also emerged. Specifically, one of the chromebook's speakers has started buzzing. I have not abused this computer whatsoever. In fact, because websites like hulu are useless on a chromebook, I haven't used the speakers that much. When I do use the speakers I do so responsibly. There is no reason that the speaker should be busted when I have only had the computer for 29 days.Because of the reasons described above, this computer is going back to Amazon as defective. I have ordered a replacement and will continue to post updates on how the replacement computer performs.So far the chromebook has been a disappointment.**Update - 3/02/2013**The chromebook is still unable to work well with Hulu and other video streaming sites. I have found an additional problem: the chromebook is unable to stream audio from Sirius. Why is it that Google has been unable to fix these problems after so much time is passed?","June 17, 2012",0
laptops,Warranty trouble,"Thomas W. Trigg ""Tom Trigg""",R2DQX14YEMPK5E,3,"Six months after receiving my Samsung Series 5 550 Chrome book, I noticed that the case had separated near the bottom left corner of the screen. I've treated the computer very well and am not aware of anything I did to cause the problem. I called Samsung, described the problem with the case, and after two hours received an RMA. I sent the computer for repairs or replacement.I received an email from the repair facility telling me that any damage to the case voided the entire Samsung warranty and offering to evaluate the computer condition for a refundable $50 fee and to repair it for an understandably unspecified fee. Samsung could have told me this before I sent the computer away, but it did not.I tried to locate a copy of the Samsung warranty but have not yet succeeded.This is a great computer, but you should be aware that the case is not substantial and that the computer is essentially sold without any warranty. In addition to the cost of the computer, you might very well have to pay for repairs based on Samsung's poor case design or manufacturing.I have rated the computer with three stars. The performance of the computer deserves five. Samsung's warranty and its response to problems caused by a poorly designed or manufactured case deserves one star at best.I had planned to buy other Samsung products, but I am rethinking that.","February 21, 2013",0
laptops,An OK laptop but not worth the money for me,Namo,R283NGFYCAUZIZ,3,"I've had this laptop for about 5 months now and have finally decided that it's time to return it. I used my previous laptop for about 5 years and after 5 months with this one, I absolutely cannot picture myself using it for another 4.5+ years. I purchased this Ultrabook as a business travel/internet machine. I didn't need a super-high performance laptop since I build my own desktops so that's where I'm coming from with this review.The pros:- Beautifully bright screen and amazing aesthetic design. This thing is pretty, that's for sure. Probably why I put up with it for so long.- Speakers are surprisingly good for a laptop. I was surprised when I heard them the first time.- Keyboard is very nice. Well-spaced and backlit.- Quick SSD that I haven't had a single problem with (besides Samsung's ""fun"" partitions).- Charger is light and tiny. Definitely a travel plus.- Battery life is amazing. I can go an entire night without charging the computer. 6+ hours easily.The cons:- Immediately out of the box, I had to reinstall Windows. The computer had a bunch of bloatware on it and there were a few driver incompatibilities that meant that the computer was not performing up to what it should based off of specs. Reinstalling windows... no problem, right? Well it comes with a recovery disk... but of course there's no optical drive. I didn't have a USB optical drive so I installed off of a thumb drive. It worked just fine, but it's kind of a silly oversight to send a recovery DVD with a system that has no DVD drive. It would not be easy to do this if you have little tech knowledge.- The ""hardware"" buttons on the keyboard (LCD backlight, sound up/down, wifi on/off, keyboard backlight...) are all run through Samsung's proprietary software EasySettings. You can guess where this is going. These buttons do not work if that software isn't running. It makes no sense that physical buttons on the keyboard have to go through software in order to function. On top of that, even if Samsung HAD to do it that way, it's frustrating that the software noticeably slows the system down.- The SSD is partitioned in an amazingly stupid way. It would make sense if you had a 500GB+ drive, but this is a 128GB SSD. There's the standard loss of space with the OS and such, but Samsung partitioned a recovery hard drive with 20GB+ and with all of the bloatware, I booted up for the first time with about 60GB usable. That's pretty unacceptable for a 128GB SSD. I cleared Samsung's partition and after the Windows reinstall, I had 100GB+ which is enough for me. Again, someone with little tech knowledge or someone who just ""wants it to work"" might be in over their head with this.- Noisy fan when it's plugged in. Not a killer con, but still kind of annoying.- Screen is starting to get keyboard imprints on it (from the lid being closed). The laptop is only ever closed on a desk (that is, no pressure on the lid to push into the keys). Nothing bad, but you can definitely see it when the backlight is off.- Screen has contrast problems. It's bright, but a lot of times it's tough to make out words when it's not black on white text. At wide viewing angles, you lose all contrast. The screen even flickers if you look at it at the wrong angle (from extreme below, on battery power. This reflects onto the keyboard and you can definitely notice it in your peripheral while typing).- When the laptop is on battery power, there's some definite drop in capability. Typing will lag every now and then on browser-intensive sites (like Facebook, specifically). I'll be typing away and then realize that half of my sentence hasn't shown up yet. Definitely not acceptable from a laptop of this price.- Here's the kicker for me and why I'm returning it: the trackpad. When it works, it's not bad at all. But starting about a month after I bought it, it started having hiccups. I would be swiping around while browsing the web and it wouldn't register some of the swipe. Odd, but it was only every now and then. Nothing to complain about too much. But then it got worse. Over the next few months, the trackpad would stop registering any touch at all for a few minutes at a time. Very frustrating. But at the very least, it would come back semi quickly. Then, over the last month, the trackpad will die out for more than half an hour at a time every hour. It's gotten so bad that I have resorted to using a USB mouse because I can't use my laptop otherwise, which completely kills the travel aspect because I have to lug around a mouse too.Bottom line: It's a great travel laptop. It's lightweight and sleek, too. For me, though, I'm a bit of a perfectionist when it comes to computers since I'm on one about 12 hours a day between work and personal, and this laptop just didn't cut it. For the price I paid, I'm not willing to accept all of the nuances and frustrations. Samsung customer support is VERY poor. Amazon customer support is VERY amazing. The former treated me like I was an idiot but were offering repairs since it was under warranty but no other compensation. Amazon treated me with respect and offered a full refund. Guess which one won out. I'm returning this laptop as soon as I can and hoping to try my luck with another brand. Like I said above, I can't see myself living with this laptop for another 5 years, especially with the trackpad problems.","March 8, 2013",0
laptops,"Same laptop, completely different review",Inseock Lee,R2RM41JKC20V2H,3,"Before I bought this laptop from amazon, I researched about this laptop in Korean website and blogs. The review was pretty good. People said this laptop provides the best display angles. While comparing Samsung Series 9 NP900X4C-A01US model and same spec Korean model (NT900X4C-A58), I found out NP900X4C-A01US has 340 nit brightness, while same spec Korean model has 400 nit brightness. I really didnt think there are no differences between NT900X4C-A58 and NP900X4C-A01US. But after I bought this laptop, I realized I was competely wrong.The display. Yes I was horrified by the washed screen and its horrible angle. The reality was completely different from reviews of same model written by Korean people. The model was exactly same. There are no differences between NT900X4C-A58 and NP900X4C-A01US except brightness. Why Samsung sells this horrible laptop that has horrible screen problem while they sell same laptop that has perfect display in korea with almost same price in America????Samsung why?","May 8, 2013",0
laptops,great product when used as an Ultrabook,Paul Lang,R1YXUAB00F18R6,3,"EDIT**** 3/24/13: 3 months of use as the primary computer in the house, and daily use at school.Uses: Micro$oft Office 2010, Basic Surfing, Occasional torrenting of work-related files (I'm too lazy to post zip files to mediaf!re), playing music (both saved flash videos and mp3's using Winamp).Avg use per day: 6-7 hoursTech Level of User: moderateHerein, I review the Samsung Series 9 after three months.Bottom line review (specifics below): This is an Ultrabook, designed for and intended as a superlight, portable machine for school, coffeeshops, and lightweighti stuff you'd do there (surfing, office stuff, listening to music). As an Ultrabook, the SS9 is an excellent product that competes with the best on the market, and generally suffers flaws similar to other ultrabooks, with caveats (keyboard and touchpad delight some and horrify others - your mileage may vary). As anything else (eg desktop gaming, graphics, etc.) or when used beyond what it was designed for (like running 3 monitors while writing a paper while running powerpoint while checking email while running winamp off a portable drive), the SS9 becomes mediocre and hard to recommend.***Do not buy this as anything other than an ultrabook, because most of the features quibble about relate to uses beyond its design.***I bought this because my huge Quad-core desktop replacement was too heavy to lug around on campus. Wanted something light with a decent screen and great battery life. Its limitations frustrate me, but it does what I wanted it to do otherwise.**********Pros***********As a machine for school it has very fast boot and transfer via USB3, it's light, I get a full day's worth of use out of a single charge, and it recharges quickly. Has a nice screen that allows outdoor use.Build is aesthetically pleasing, nice webcam, fairly useful system software, minimal bloatware.Designers eliminated ports/components that don't enhance the intended ultraportability (namely the DVD ROM and full-sized ports) and replaced them with mini-ports.Runs very cool and quiet - I've never heard the fan kick on before.***********Features that have mixed reviews**************Touchpad: Essentially, people who like or dislike the pad make the same observations: It's large, sensitive, and designed to be used in a specific way based on gestures and zones. So, if you've got big hands and long fingers like I do, and you take time to learn how to use it, and of course if you patch it from original drivers to current, it ranks among the best pads to be released (IMHO) in spite of a few bugs. Those with smaller hands, clumsy fingers, impatience, or those who expect the pad to do what they want it to do in the manner that they want it (instead of how it was programmed) will hate it. If you plan to buy this laptop, if at all possible you should testdrive the pad because it's a make/break feature for many.Keyboard - Keystrokes are shallow, not much recoil, keyboard is sort of cramped, and the ease by which you can accidentally hit the touchpad and move the cursor while typing is a huge deal-breaking annoyance to many. I had that problem often, depending on the angle that I'm typing from. It's irritating as an ant bite between your toes. That said, we all have different tastes in keyboards. Those with smaller hands or people who have nimble fingers probably won't mind the keyboard. Personally, I prefer deep keys on a full-sized keyboard with lots of recoil. My hands are big and I type like I play the piano - percussively.**************Minor Cons********************HD could have been bigger, and having to pay extra to get Win7 on the machine (given that Win8 is geared towards touchscreens) ticked me off.*********************Cons************************It appears that when closed, the keyboard contacts the screen. This lead to a nick in my screen, and requires me to clean the screen fairly often.The Intel HD card SUUCCCKKKSSS. I've experienced all sorts of graphical corruption with certain applications, acceleration is non-existent, the control panel interface can't be configured for three monitors (which I do run at home using my Series 9), and the driver has a tendency to crash. I run my computers hard, so it's possible that single-taskers / surfers won't run into the same problems. Worst of all, though - when you hook up a second or third monitor (via the mini-HDMI), the second screen has a tendency to momentarily disconnect and reconnect (takes about 5 seconds) and at this time there is no fix. ****One more thing - my mini-hdmi will do the same thing (on/off) if I bump the cord even slightly. Has anyone else experienced this? In any event, these problems relate primarily to uses of the machine beyond its intent (ultraportable), so take that into consideration. This isn't a desktop replacement.Some folks say that the HD is cheap and should be replaced - I can't comment on that.The ports are all fairly tight - it's kind of hard to fit the power adapter and mini-hdmi adapters into the ports. It worries me given the lightness and build of the machine. This is one aspect of the design that might prove detrimental in the long run.The backlit keyboard is marginally useful - only in a dark lecture room has it actually been useful.Could have used a fourth USB port. Assembly feels a little flimsy in some places.I boughtis b ecause my desktop replacement Dv6 Quad Core Edition (8g RAM, 1 Gg dedicated video card) was too heavy to lug around.h I was a little skeptical about the Series 9's video capabilities because it has the intel HD 4000, whereas at home I ran three monitors off the Dv6. After a couple of weeks, here are my thoughts --First and foremost, the Series 9 is capable of three monitors, but the Intel Graphics Manager is clunky and doesn't seem to support the configuration. Rather, I use a USB adapter for the monitor and it works fine, with the caveat that switching between the configurations (eg, from desk to school and back) is kind of annoying because it doesn't always snap back to the native screen. Also, having multiple monitors running seems to screw up other software aspects - for example, because a monitor has speakers, bluetooth seems to no longer pick up my bluetooth wireless speakers.The laptop runs cool at all times, and handles basic stuff like office, browsing, movies, streaming video, etc. with speed and fluidity. It isn't as fast as my old desktop replacement, but I can forgive this because it has one half the processing power. One thing that puzzles me - for some reason, Google Chrome seems to hang when opening multiple tabs on this laptop - I have no idea if it is the laptop or some addon, but I can't reproduce the error on other machines.The screen is fantastic, if a bit bright. Works fine outside as well as it does inside. The hinge for folding the screen back and forth is nice and tight. The webcam is a basic webcam, no frills.Could have used a fourth USB port. Assembly feels a little flimsy in some places.","January 24, 2013",0

laptops,[Updated 7/14/2012] A decent laptop,Imran,RTV1SOMXK1CG7,3,"Update3: My newer unit even had wireless problems after awhile. It wasn't really an n-router problem because I disabled n-mode and was still having trouble connecting to regular g or b. My new one also had horrible backlight bleeding. It turns out that I got fed up of this laptop after reading the cons so I just returned it for now. I may get the UX31A-DB51 again, but for now I am laptop-less. I just feel like Asus has not put enough time into ensuring that users get the optimal experience. It shouldn't take 3 Zenbooks for a user to not experience wireless problems or have a good trackpad or something.Update2: Got my new Zenbook. It also had Wireless problems, but they weren't as bad as my old one. I was able to fix these problems by tweaking my router settings. Everything is great now. Anyways, for the sake of testing out this keyboard, I might as well finish this review.Pros:- Amazing 1080p display- Great Bang & Olufsen sound- Looks very nice- Backlit keyboard- Fast Ivy Bridge processor- Very fast startup times- Great Amazon warranty - replaced in 1 day- Excellently packed + sleeve given- Very light and portableCons:- Wireless problems. If you have an n-router, you WILL need to tweak out your settings- Comes with a lot of bloatware- Battery life is just ""okay""- Touchpad needs to be tweaked in the settings before it is usable- Colors on display are a little saturated- The Fn key needs to be used to access volume and brightness control by pressing Fn+F-key combo. I think it would be a lot more useful if those volume and brightness keys were able to be pressed without Fn, and Fn would be used only to access the actions of the F-keys. I'm making it sound complicated, but I basically mean the opposite of what it is now.- Asus tech support is pretty much useless. They assume you're some amateur with computers. You're better off just returning your Zenbook to Amazon if you think you have a major problem because they give you free 1-day shipping anyways.Update: After trying many things to try and fix my network issues, I have decided just to get a replacement. Amazon is coming to pick mine up tomorrow and will give me a new one. I will update about my new Zenbook once it comes.Just got my product. I love the 1080p display, the Bang & Olufsen sound, super speedy ADATA SSD, and basically everything about it. However, I have experienced a MAJOR problem that just makes this product annoying for me. I've had issues connecting to my Wireless Internet ever since I got the laptop. It was the first thing I noticed and did not leave a good impression. When I click connect to my network, the Zenbook takes ages to connect and usually stops at ""Limited access"" or ""No network access"". After several attempts, it *sometimes* connects to the internet. I know for a fact that it isn't a problem with my internet because the 3 other laptops that I have connect to the network easily. I also tried tethering the Mobile Network from my phone onto the laptop via WiFi and it wouldn't work. I've been trying to fix this and I'm going to call Asus to try to fix this problem. Hopefully it isn't a hardware issue and I won't have to return it. Asides from this problem, the laptop is great and I'm excited to use it. I'll let you guys know what happens.","June 29, 2012",0
laptops,Bad outweighs all the Good,"Gordon Zhang ""nodrog""",RDQM6A9OCWQHR,3,"The ultrabook is a decent one and can be altered to different specs when you order it but the common error that occurs in all UX31A from 2012 models are from hardware.After my ultrabrook's stopped turning on so I contacted Amazon and was offered an exchange. The new one worked fine for a month until the keyboard stopped responding. The usual keys are D, F, K, E, /, Backspace, and more keys progressed over time. I contacted ASUS and the customer service was so generic and unhelpful aka restart laptop, install new drivers, factory reset etc etc. I was finally offered a chance to send my laptop back with a fee. I chose to opt out of the fee and google a fix. After days of reading, scouring, and trying to fix my laptop I found out the error that appears to be very common and there is a universal fix for the keyboard.[...]This is a picture guide and should not void your warranty because you are not changing anything to the hardware other than tape.

laptops,Quality control issues NEED to be addressed,David,R2LL1JGVISVC11,3,"I can imagine this ultrabook being perfect in every way with some quality control.#1: Dead/ stuck pixels. I went through 3 of these ultrabooks. 7, 2, 2 dead/stuck pixels respectively.#2: sandisk vs adata ssd. All 3 were sandisk. I don't know about you, but how can someone live with a $1000+ ultrabook knowing they could have had a much better ssd.

laptops,I want to love this thing...,B. Ellis,R25BVNFYROD434,3,"** Update 12/23/2012 **The third time was a charm and I got a good one, at least for now. I can't say if this will be the case over time. I do love the machine. As stated before, if you a get one, update ALL DRIVERS from the ASUS site. Put it through its paces during the 30 day return window from Amazon.----------------This is a gorgeous laptop. ASUS developed a fantastic product and dropped the ball on the quality process.Unfortunately I am now sending back my second one. The first had a bad graphics card.. even with all drivers updated from ASUS site it would randomly melt down and lock up with noise on the display. Not cool when presenting to the new client in the boardroom. So, back it went.The replacement arrived yesterday. It had a bad keyboard right out of the box as others have mentioned in reviews. Some keys got better after new drivers were installed, but delete and backspace stopped working and even the enter key is suspect. So, back it goes.I will say that both units came from Amazon Warehouse Deals in hopes that they would have corrected any problems from the buggy initial unit. I have historically had very good luck with Warehouse Deals, but they don't seem to be checking these units at all.Because I am a slow learner and I honestly would really like to have a fully functioning unit like this, I am going to give it one more try in hope that I get a good one. I would not be doing this were it not for Amazons 30 day return policy.My advice it to believe the reviews and if you want to pick one of these up, be sure to install all new drivers from the ASUS site and then put it through it's paces in the first 30 days so you don't get stuck with one of the bad ones.","December 16, 2012",0

Ironic Asus touts the screen quality and then don't do a thorough quality check.Otherwise, I messed around on the computer for about an hour and it's really responsive and very, very compact and light.

laptops,"Great tablet, terrible keyboard design.","Tech Nurse ""Tech Nurse""",R2SYU9LW72AKN1,3,"UPDATE:I've made the hard decision to return this item. I use my laptop 70% of the time, tablet functions 30%. I can't justify the cost on a product half baked. Between some win 8 bugs and the issues already documented below, I've opted to update to a ultrabook laptop. HP Elitebook Folio 9470m which you can read my review here: http://www.amazon.com/HP-EliteBook-Folio-180GB-Notebook/dp/B009PHUR66/ref=cm_aya_orig_subjIn 6 months, there will be better devices, hopefully one that addresses the shortcomings of this device. By then Win 8 patches should be in place and more sites will address IE 10 compatabilities. Even Amazon's site struggles with IE 10.Hopefully the Elitebook Folio will have a touchscreen and stylus option with a tablet option by then.I find that I need to work via laptop 6-10 hrs a day and then I want to relax and use the tablet functions, but with battery limitations with this device, you don't have this option. So when I actually want to use the tablet, the battery is already drained from the day use, unless I was plugging it in everytime I returned to my desk which sometimes is not an option.So for now, I'll continue to use a laptop and switch to a tablet as needed. As a tablet, this product is awesome. The question you have to ask is, $1,200 awesome? For me, not right now.UPDATE:You can read my updates below, but I put this on the very top. I have to echo the review by Isaac related to the keyboard. I've mentioned the issues below, but the price for just the tablet doesn't justify not having a functioning keyboard. The top heaviness and the lack of being able tilt the tablet further back and that it's just a basic keyboard without much more to add to the tablet functioning, I've dropped my original 4 star rating to 3 as this combo just fails as a combo. As a tablet, wins hands down, but I didn't spend this much money for just a tablet. Samsung sells the keyboard alone for $130 which is ridiculous since it has little to offer that another external keyboard couldn't offer. I'm hoping Asus comes out with a pen input device as they already nailed the keyboard design with the SD card, extra battery. The only missing item would be extra storage option.For those looking at tablets with pen options, here's a link that compares the tablets: [...]Previous Review:Fortunate to have a Microsoft store near me and they had just received a shipment, hadn't even had time to put it on display.They do not charge a restocking fee and they are in their holiday timeline, so I have until Jan 14 to decide whether to keep or return. Just to make sure, I had them write this on my receipt.Ok, not that any of the above really helps in the review, but in the event you have one of these Microsoft stores nearby, it may be an option, especially since Amazon seems to still be sold out.I have an asus transformer 1st gen, kindle fire, ipad 1 & 2, I use a Toshiba R835 Ultrabook for most of my day to day computer work.I'm looking for something that can replace essentially the need to carry a tablet and a laptop and can handle windows software for business.I will update this review as needed. I'm not going to repeat the typical reviews on specs, etc. There's plenty out there, this will be on a more simplified level, from an end user perspective.INITIAL FIRST IMPRESSIONS:Tablet is big. As a computer it's almost too small, but it's a compromise. Weight as a tablet felt heavy, but not as heavy as my first gen asus transformer, but I'm use to carrying the ipad 2, weight as a laptop feels fine. Nice and compact, although a bit on the thick side, but a nice smooth profile.Cons: No backlit keyboard, touch pad is narrow, no full size SD card, no VGA port (I hate carrying dongles and adapters). Wish the keyboard had an extra battery and storage, ie. another hard drive, this would help weight down the keyboard. The keyboard base is light, making it top heavy. Wish they used USB 3 ports in the keyboard base instead of USB 2. And it would of been nice if the ports were together so you could use an external DVD drive (which requires 2 usb ports typically).There's a large learning curve, mainly due to the new OS. What doesn't help is, no manual. It comes with a vague quick start guide. I'm still trying to figure out how to turn the blue tooth on and NFR. I'm sure there's a pdf, just have to find it.I did load a 64 GB micro sd card and the system recognized it without problems. The power adapter is nice and compact, about half the bulk as my Toshiba R835 which was light to begin with.Even though it comes with a 128 GB hard drive, you actually have 78 GB of 101 GB available, so space will be tight.Before you dock the tablet to the keyboard, you have to remove 2 plastic tabs which I ended up having to use a knife to pry them up and out they were very tight fitting.Also they don't plaster stupid stickers all over the device (Except for 2 on the back side of the tablet. No bloatware which is something Microsoft stores pride themselves on.Anyway, I know this is not much to go on, but I'll update this the more I start using it in real world work, once I load my programs and get use to the navigation. Hope this helps.ADDITIONAL UPDATES:Took about an hour for the battery to charge to 100%. I've now been using it for almost 3 hours and the meter still says about 3 hours left. The screen resolution is fantastic.I haven't really stressed this computer out yet. Mainly just learning how to navigate windows 8. I did come across setting up my blue tooth and I have it paired with my Samsung S3, no really I'm not a Samsung employee, but it's one of the few that offered a pen input solution along with the other added benefits.I did come across an option to have the fan run automatically, at reduced speed, or not at all. It's default is off, so I changed it to auto.So far, the unit's remained cool, but again haven't stressed it with lots of videos or intensive applications.Viewing angles are definitely better than my Toshiba R835. The stylus is short, about 2/3 size of a normal pen and it's very narrow. It's housed in the tablet and it's a very snug fit. I'm sure it'll loosen over tine, but if I had nails, they'd be breaking trying to get it out.Also one thing to note is the screen when docked with the keyboard doesn't tilt all the way back. I'm finding myself wanting to tilt the screen back just a bit further, but that's just me. Probably done this way to prevent the unit from falling over, referencing the top heavy design.More Updates:The Box I have says OB 4 GB Ram which to me means On Board RAM. The hard Drive says 128 SSD 4mm, which I'm guessing means it's part of the mother board also, since most SSD footprint are the typical 7-9 mm in height. I see no means of removing the back without damaging the plastic. I wish I could upgrade the storage and RAM. Samsung really missed an opportunity not having extra storage in the keyboard, no backlit keyboard, no full SD card slot and no extra battery. If they had done all of that, there would be very little reason not to like this completely. It would also address the top heaviness. If this had a battery on the bottom with twice the capacity of the tablet portion and it could charge the tablet, I would definitely take the added weight for that additional run time.As far as the camera appears to be 2 MP on the front and 5MP on the back based on running the camera app and they have a size selection and the back only went up to 5MP.The Samsung apps are found in the apps store. Tap on the store tile, scroll to the Samsung picks. All the aps are listed right there. Somehow I totally missed these the first time because I checked there first since I figured it made sense. Samsung must of added them between the first time I looked and after my factory restore.I'm not too impressed with the Samsung apps, they appear to be just the overgrown version of what you see with the Samsung S3 android apps. I ended up downloading the free MS one note.BTW, I tried one notes, handwrote a bunch of stuff, lassoed it and was able to move the items with very little lag. Yes, there was a slight one, but nothing that wasn't usable.I like that the device has a palm detection so when it senses the pen, you can rest your palm on the screen. That may be more the software, but it's worked with one note and S note.I'm really not liking this keyboard, feels cramped and trying to hold the unit by the keyboard is not comfortable as all the weight is on the top so it places a strain on your wrist when carrying or holding. You'll probably find yourself holding the top which to me seems awkward as I don't do this with a laptop.I'm having work load Windows 8 Enterprise as my work requires the Pro edition of Windows 8. That's more related to my work, not the device, but once they do this, they'll load the MS office and I can start loading additional software. So far, I've been using it more for typical tablet use, which I definitely am enjoying. I'm seriously thinking of just getting a Bluetooth keyboard.Also this device is abnormally long in length, making it long and narrow (bigger than a pad of notebook paper, yet narrower than a typical pad). Which means at meetings, it looks a bit odd. I have to look for a business folio that I can place this in, unfortunately I don't think many folios will be accommodate something this tall. I'll let you know if I find one. I would of preferred one that was the same size as a pad of paper. Could of used the height to even the look and that would of given the touch pad some added room too in the height department.Also, Samsung has included a Samsung utility called quick starter that includes the start menu, so if you get really stuck, this will help.Of course if you've made it this far in this review, I'm impressed as I know this is getting long, but hopefully this is helping.As soon as I get Win 8 Pro loaded and MS Office loaded, I'll really be able to provide run time in real world usage. So far just browsing and basic tasks, the fan doesn't kick on and I'm getting roughly 6-6.5 hours. I did watch about 45 minutes of you tube videos, which the fan did kick in and the top felt slightly warm, but nothing like my laptop. It was barely noticeable to the touch and I had to hold my ear to the vent to even detect the fan was running.*** I just loaded a few pics ***Update: The 3G/4G slot next to the micro SD card slot is an empty shell. I'm guessing there's no antenna as there is definitely not a card slot, if you try to place your sim card, it will just fall into an empty space and good luck trying to retrieve it. Explains why the slot isn't marked. Little disappointed as I took optional as if I went to a cell carrier and asked for a sim card and an account, I'd just be able to put the sim card in and I'm good to go. A bit misleading. For me, it's not that big of a deal as my cell phone on 4 LTE has the capacity to be a hot spot for no extra charge.Also, the hinge for the keyboard appears to be loosening up a bit too much in which the tablet will move by itself once it passes a certain point. I'm thinking that I'd prefer a backlit Bluetooth keyboard built into a portfolio tablet case. At least I have until Jan to see what else comes out. Perhaps Samsung will create another optional keyboard base with all the missing features that were mentioned above. Ok, one can be wishful.Other issue noted is attempting to upgrade to Windows Pro and having difficulty having the tablet boot via a usb. Changed the bios boot order, but so far it's not booting from the USB device with the wind 8 Pro install files. I'll update this when it's successful.","November 10, 2012",0
laptops,"Good ""power"" Windows Tablet, with some issues...",J. McDonald,R3KBWS4J08MVPK,3,"Update: I've had to lower my rating on this tablet by a bit, due to quality and customer support issues. After six months or so, I noticed that the touch interface was no longer responding (to pen or finger) along the right or bottom edges in portrait mode... The tablet developed a 'dead zone' about 1/4 of an inch wide along those edges. And unfortunately, when you 'full screen' a desktop mode program (e.g. browser), that's where the scroll bars lie... so you can't use them to scroll.Samsung support agreed to fix it under warranty, and they corrected it *mostly*... not completely, but enough to make it usable. But they gave me instructions on how to use their included utility to back up my user data to an SD card before sending the tablet in for repair. I did so, and when I got the unit back, I used this same tool to try and restore my user data.Their data restore tool *bricked* my tablet. I called support again and they authorized another warranty return for a disk re-imaging. When I spoke with their repair guy about how to restore my user data from the Samsung backup, he said not to try... the tool was buggy... apparently, this isn't the first time he'd had to do this. And he couldn't recommend any other tool that would work.So, while the tablet itself is back in working order and is functioning pretty much in line with my original review, I'm afraid I have to knock off one star for the touch screen not even making it for six months, and another star for their Samsung-specific software... a backup utility that bricks your machine, and no way to re-install Windows short of a warranty return.Once this unit is out of warranty, it's just a matter of time and luck before it's useless.======= Original Review Below ======I've had my ATIV Smart PC 700 for a little over a month now, so I thought it was time to share some feedback.I guess the most important ""take-away"" I can offer potential buyers is that I find this to be a very good ""power"" Windows tablet, but don't buy it as an Android (or iPad) replacement; that way lies pain and regret. :-) I still own and use my Android tablet; I just use it for different things.This Windows tablet is an *excellent* replacement for my older ""convertible"" Laptop/Tablet. This tablet has the power and resources of a mid-range desktop system, but it's in a compact and (relatively) lightweight package. The battery life is decent... about 6-7 hours of actual use. (I recently made it through a 12-hour day at a conference, using the tablet to read reference material and take notes.) The USB3 and Micro-SD ports give me plenty of decent-speed extra storage. And I can run existing Windows programs on it and surf the web with a real ""desktop"" browser, etc.All that having been said, it's worth noting that the *Windows 8* ecosystem is nowhere near as mature as its Android or iPad brethren. There are far fewer true Windows 8 apps, and many of the ones that are available still have some growing up to do. That's why being able to run existing Windows programs is so vital. In practice, I find that I generally do my tablet gaming on my Android tablet, and most of my PC gaming on a desktop system; this Windows tablet is mostly for work-type stuff... development, documentation, and reference materials. But the Smart PC Pro fills that role with power to spare.As for the machine itself, it had a somewhat rocky start (buggy firmware and drivers), but after a number of updates from Samsung, all of the big issues seem to be worked out. The tablet now seems to be a pretty solid ""compromise"" between tablet and power notebook. The keyboard is decent, if not great. After a driver update, the trackpad is functional, though it does give me far more fits than other notebooks I've used. Once I turned off the psychotically annoying 'Automatic Brightness Adjustment', the screen is crisp, bright, and a pleasure to use. I prefer the clamshell keyboard to the MS Surface's kickstand; I can use this design in my lap. Like some other reviewers, I had to learn to be sure and *firmly* attach the tablet to the keyboard; mine doesn't make a noticeable 'click' to let you know it's locked.As a tablet, it's actually more powerful than you really need. (I might've bought the Atom-based Smart PC 500 if I could've gotten it with a 128 GB SSD.) The larger screen size is nice, and I haven't found the extra weight to be a problem. The speakers are decent enough for personal viewing. The cooling fan seems quiet enough under most use cases that I don't even notice it.My biggest complaint through this whole experience was with Samsung Customer Support; their performance was abysmal. Fortunately, Samsung Engineering released updates that corrected my issues, freeing me from my reliance on their customer support personnel.So, all in all I have to give this unit 5 stars. While I can certainly name things that could have been done better, the simple fact is that this tablet does feel solid, perform very well, and provide an excellent replacement for my older convertible tablet... which is what I wanted from it.","February 21, 2013",0
laptops,A bit rough for a Samsung product,Flipfan,R2O9FVRU86SZ5N,3,"I own a bunch of Samsung kit.Two of the 10.1"" Notestwo S3'sa Note1a 8.9 Galaxy TabLove their stuff.The 700t isn't up to Samsung's normal build standards. The bezel would pop and flex, the keyboard would work fine for 10 minutes, then go through bouts of disconnect/reconnects. The rotation lock button would stop working mid session (likely software conflict with the graphics driver). Everyone uses these things for different reasons. For me, it's as a pen tablet, and then as a semi- laptop. So i only really care about three functions:rotate - flakydocked keyboard for the train - flakykeyboard via bluetooth at the office - great (I also used a Zagg Flex keboard with it all day at the office. That was awesome.)So for my use case, I had to return it. But for others, I would imagine its great. I don't care about the USB ports or video out (both worked fine for me, mini HDMI works well).The samsung attachable keyboard is not really a dock. It's meant as a ride-along companion. It's the weakest link. Quite frustrating. I know some folks have no issues, and i did all the software updates, and techniques like turning it off before attaching it and pushing down and right, and pushing the button in to pre-latch it. But no avail. I know I could get another one, but the reality is, it is easy to return in the early 14 day window, and their is clearly an issue with the design, based on other reviews.Totaly bummer.Thumbs up for Win8 (I now believe RT means Real-Time :) that Metro interface is great. Pro adds one tile for heavy duty access...when you think of it as a tablet plus extra heavy duty productivity, the model makes sense)Thumbs up for Samsung getting a product out quicklyThumbs down for some of the flaky behaviour. I don't mind stuff that I know will go away with software releases, but this has some hardware issues...Looking for another pen tablet. Hope CES comes up with something...","January 8, 2013",0

laptops,Not impressed,chels_21,R15L4AMYVD9VIP,3,"First off, I paid $367 for this laptop including shipping in October 2012... so I'm not sure why it's listed at $40+ more expensive almost 1 1/2 years later (I'm updating/rewriting this review... February 2014). I got this laptop to replace my 4 year old Acer. I have not been impressed with Gateway, and Windows 8 is a pain in the @$$ (I realize this isn't Gateway's fault).My 3 overall complaints:1) The time on this thing is never right! Every time I let it sit and come back to it, usually over night, the time changes itself to 2 hours behind, and I have to change it back manually. Not really a major issue, but it is annoying and I'm not going to lie... it's had me thinking it's 2 hours earlier in the day than it actually is more than once.2) The battery life isn't great. On a full battery just surfing the web/Facebooking, the battery lasts about 2 hours tops.3) Start up has never been an easy task. I don't shut it down as often as I should, like overnight... I usually just close the lid and let it hibernate. It's always taken several minutes to wake up, and I have to type in my password 2-3 times due to the fact that it lags when typing it in. If the battery dies while I'm using it, for example, it takes another several minutes to get the screen to turn back on. Usually I end up having to hold down the on/off button to reboot, because pushing the space bar or the on/off button one time doesn't wake it up.A year and a half ago this computer was an upgrade to my 4 year old Acer, that was so slow by that point I could barely get it to start up. But now, a year and a half later, I can clearly see that the Acer was a better computer in general. It took twice as much time to get to the point that this one is getting to already (slow and misbehaving, freezing a lot). If you're buying this for the Gateway brand, or if you've never tried a Gateway and are thinking about switching, I suggest researching other models instead of/on top of Gateway. I highly recommend Acer.","November 7, 2012",0
laptops,Not what I thought,"Shanie ""Mother of 4. Married 18 years. Zumba ...",R3C490NL9CUHUJ,3,"I purposely avoided buying an Acer, having been told that the versions under $500 are mass produced and have more breakage and problems. I had no idea Gateway and Acer are one and the same. I wish that had been listed somewhere in the description. I found this computer to be slow, I had trouble restoring my files from Carbonite on to it, and Windows 8 is hard to figure out. The computer frame was plastic, like most computers under $500. So, I sent it back and purchased an HP with Beats Audio and Windows 7 and a steel frame. I spent about $150 more, but felt the durability, performance and ease of use would be well worth it in the end.","March 3, 2013",0

laptops,Poor placement of mouse and jumpy keyboard,Aviva Gittle Publishing,R2UI17RUPAFO3K,3,"It would have 2 stars, but it was a great price. If I were reviewing it along with the pre-installed Windows 8 it would be 2 stars.But, I'm going to separate out the machine from the operating system.Likes: monitor size and screen quality (although there is glare, but they all seem to have that), number keyboard, feel of keyboard, fairly lightweight (for a larger size laptop).Dislikes: the mouse seems to be placed too far to the left. Also, if you don't click it in the far lower left right corner, it is very difficult to push. Carpal tunnel syndrome here I come!Let's talk about Windows 8 for a moment, shall we? I could learn to live with Windows 8. It's just different and takes getting used to (I had that issue when MS Office revamped their interface years ago...and now it's no big deal). But, Corel X5 would not work on it. Which I only needed to load so I could upgrade to X6 which does work on Wndows 8. (See my CorelDraw X6 review for the full rant on that issue.)I made the mistake of trying to change the operating system myself. I won't bore you with the gory details. Bottom line: I had to pay a pro to fix the mess I made. I now have Windows 7 Ultimate 64-bit OS loaded and I'm happier camper.Amazon does not let you return computers unless there is something wrong with them. This is a good deal; just make sure the programs you want to use work on Windows 8. If you're not sure, buy a Windows 7 computer. It's easier to upgrade than to downgrade.One more piece of somewhat unrelated advice: Back up all of your files on an external hard drive or in the cloud (dropbox.com is good) before you change your operating system. I hear all you techie guys laughing. Go ahead; that's why we pay you the big bucks. :-)","August 2, 2013",0
laptops,"Squishy mouse clicks and finicky touch pad, glitchy video card and where the heck are my F keys?!",Karen Lorraine Merton,R14WS8FUVUDVJH,3,"Not a fan, really. For one, could Windows 8 be any more ridiculously frilly? But beyond that (since an operating system can be changed out), I'll mention problems with the actual laptop. I haven't had it that long and it's not that it's awful, but I am NO fan. The left and right mouse clickers are squishy and annoyingly difficult to get quick reactions on for double clicking. The actual touch censor pad- ESPECIALLY when first opening the laptop- seems quite slow to respond. Between the slow response of both the mouse and cursor, I cannot tell you how many times I have clicked on stupid ads and whatnot on the tops and edges of a screen. Quite annoying, really. And the F keys no longer function as the primary key! Perhaps that is fairly common now, it's been a few years since I had to buy a laptop, but I use the F keys all the time and now have to fold the function key to operate them. Also (VERY annoying), I have to hold the function to operate the ""home"" and ""end"" keys and a number of other things, so just be sure to analyze the picture of the key pad before you purchase it to be sure you like the layout. The only thing I was looking for was the number keypad, which is present and nice to have. One more thing, I use Photoshop A LOT and have noticed some glitches there. It's difficult to explain the exact things it's doing, but it does strange things for some cropping work or when initially opening multiple images (and I have used PS for YEARS on a number of different computers and never had this problem). I THINK it's the video card not handling the program well, but it COULD be the new Windows. Beyond that, it's a basic laptop and seems to function alright. But I REALLY wish I hadn't spilled coffee on my old one:/","June 26, 2013",0

laptops,A compilation of decent parts and an below average wifi card/driver placed in a premium feeling shell.,Yunjun Li,R344S2IH4AB3VX,3,"Much like a chipotle burrito, this computer looks premium but has average if not sub-par components. Not only is this computer thinner than most, it's also harder to use. The bios is problematic to get around, the drivers for the wifi card make me want to cry. I live in a dorm and when i walk 10 feet away from the router, i lose connection. as an example, my roommate's macbook and taichi both work when they're down the hall. The Intel 6235 card is worse than useless, its a hassle and a time waster. The sleek feel would have made up for the battery life as well if not for the fact that literally nothing in this pretty little eye-candy chassis is actually upgrade-able. While i understand why ram isn't i don't see why Asus had to pull an Apple out of their ass and throw on a new standard for their m-sata or pci-e (still am not sure which one as the ssd is too crappy to determine the max connection speed) connected ssd (which by the way is a custom Sandisk u100 for me). The only redeeming factor on this computer is the beautiful screen (mine had little noticeable bleeding, yay) and the very solid keyboard as well as the overall feel of the computer itself.

laptops,I would love it but...,"speedydmg ""dannyg""",RZ1O4JMJAD97K,3,"This is a great little convertible but if I had to do it again, I would choose a single screen device.Because it has two screens, the drivers are not reliable or fast switching from laptop to tablet mode on the fly. Occasionally I'll reboot if for example, the multi-touch feature is not working in laptop mode or there is no touch interface active in the tablet mode. It is supposed to switch automatically when opening or closing the device. Sometimes it does not switch at all and you have to use the special screen mode key on the keyboard to select inner, outer or both screens, or toggle the lock switch if tablet mode is not working.Sometimes I wish it could do tent mode but the single screen mode with the device open is locked to sit like a backwards laptop, and tent mode would be upside down. I have had it work in tent mode before but that was because the drivers failed to switch occasionally. Usually it just turns on the laptop screen and turns off the tablet screen the minute you crack it open.In tablet mode, it does automatically re orient if not locked based on gravitational position, but sometimes it does not.The battery life is more like that of a typical laptop. You are lucky to get 3-4 hours out of it. The charging time can take more than a couple of hours, contrary to what some have suggested (30 minutes).I did have some intermittent problems with the touch screen digitizer and almost sent it back until I realized there would be a restocking fee (not an Amazon seller). Once in a while when powered on it acts as if a ghost is touching the upper right corner but it can be corrected by suspending and starting, and happens rarely now. I'll claim warranty if it gets worse.The Micro VGA connector/adapter is too similar to the micro HDMI. If you have bad eyes, be careful not to try to plug the micro HDMI cable into the VGA (left side) connector or you will damage it, I assume part of the system board.The 128GB solid state drive is almost half used up by the OS and ASUS utilities.There is no SD or micro SD adapter. If you want more storage you'll have to use a clunkier USB drive, although it does have two high speed USB 3.0 ports.It sometimes seems a little slow with a few things open, and probably because of all the ASUS bloatware, but I should have considered an i7 model with 8GB of RAM.On the plus side, it is light sleek and amazingly thin for a clam shell.The dual screen can be useful for presenting PowerPoint or other material in mirror or extended mode, but I'd practice and iron out possible issues before taking it to a customer site.I did upgrade to 8.1 and it had no issues, but I will attempt to update all ASUS drivers to see if some of the other issues can be improved.All in all, I'm happy with the purchase, and people who see it really think it's pretty cool, but I would consider a single screen device with a longer battery life I had to buy again. Maybe the next generation will be better.","March 26, 2014",0

laptops,A long wait for what was promised,Thaumasurge,R3KOB2AH5X14OE,3,"My experience: I have owned this ASUS Taichi since July of 2013 and in almost a year of ownership, I have hardly used the computer at all. Immediately upon receiving it, the touchscreen lid was pushing too hard into the ordinary notebook screen and it had to be sent back not once, but twice to try and fix it. The next big issue came when Windows 8.1 was released. Long story short, driver conflicts between Windows 8.1 and the Taichi caused the touchscreen lid to be unusable. A BIOS update was released FOUR MONTHS LATER to fix the problem. However, attempting to update the BIOS from the touchscreen caused it to freeze during the process and render the machine unusable, and so it was sent back to ASUS for a THIRD time. After the release of Windows 8.1 Update 1 (an update that made it easier for desktop/mouse users to use Windows 8.1), neither screen would boot without Safe Mode. In the end, another BIOS update was released and the problems seem to have finally gone away.My Thoughts: There is no laptop on the market like it. The true and original ultrabook with the ability to have 2 screen at once and flip between them with ease. I had owned an ASUS Vivobook X200 and felt I wanted something more tablet orientated. Many laptops that came out around the same time period and some laptops that have come out today offer far less for equal if not more money. A similarly priced $1000 laptop wouldn't have things like a solid state drive or a touchscreen, let alone 2 screens that you could use simultaneously. While still starting with Windows 8 and being $300 cheaper than it's release price, it's worth every penny compared to what others give you for much more money.Conclusion: It is a wonderful laptop and feels very professional. But with such uniqueness comes a price. Make sure you update it to the latest BIOS before upgrading it to Windows 8.1 or you'll encounter some problems that just ruin the experience.","May 7, 2014",0

laptops,Not Quite There for Me,Troy L Teague,R1F10QZXQVJUUR,3,"For me, the Taichi is a glimpse into the future, but, alas, that future has not quite arrived. I very much wanted this to replace both my laptop (a very nice Toshiba Portege) and my iPad. I do most things on my laptop, but I love to read and relax with a tablet like the iPad.I really wanted this tablet to work for me, and I was willing to sacrifice some comforts I had been accustomed to in order to make this work; however, in the end, the battery life is just way too short. It's not quite 2 hours, and I have tweaked with not running WiFi (of course, what's the point?), putting on the lowest power usage profile, and turning the brightness down as much as I can bear. It still burns through a full charge in 2 hours or less.In fact, I have been on a flight and witnessed the battery indicator (unbeknownst to me at the time) erroneously become stuck at 60-something percent. Without warning, the tablet shut off. I didn't lose any data, but the point is that 3 hours is a bare minimum for any respectable portable to offer, especially if the relevant device is a touch screen tablet.The pluses are how beautiful the display is. Colors are brilliant and crisp. The stylus is about as close to using real pen and paper that I have used on a tablet. Just playing the simple card games that come loaded with Windows 8 is enjoyable because it feels so real to me. I haven't cared to play Solitaire in years, but, suddenly, it was a newly rediscovered old friend.There are some very positive reviews, and I cannot disagree with what they say, but, again, the battery life is well short of where it needs to be; consequently, I feel a 3 is the highest score I can give. Otherwise, it would be a 5.I am back on my Portege, which tends to spoil me with up to 5 hours of battery life.So, if you can work tethered to power most of the time, this could be the right tablet for you.","July 31, 2013",0
laptops,"Very intriguing concept, works as advertised, athough it's buggy!","E. Rose """"early adopter""""",R3HKZF3LK1ALEA,3,"Extremely versatile computer/tablet, a little heavy, but it's the keyboard which it's a poor choice. The cursor jumps around, and you end up typing in areas where you did not intend to. Similar problem was encountered in some Sony laptops. Can't tell why, but it's there and has nothing to do with the individual typing proficiency.","June 25, 2013",0
laptops,I've nicknamed it the Mullet Machine,esjay,R30NBQG0WHMKCG,3,"I will make an attempt not to be redundant with this review. There are scads of professional reviews online that provide some good information. However, it's worth repeating that one must first decide what the point of having two screens that you can't see at the same time is. For me, I wanted to try something just as goofy as Windows 8.The out-of-box experience was pretty bad. Mine crashed several times and was then followed by 8-10 reboots. The first for Windows Update, and the rest for ASUS Live Update. That being said, I am glad it was updating itself. The accelerometer didn't work at all, then behaved erratically, then finally started working. Mysteriously, the screen will sometimes flip upside down without being moved at all.The hard drive came in two partitions, one 95.3 GB for the OS and the remaining 117 GB for DATA. Makes no sense to me, but it was easy enough to delete the DATA volume and then extend the OS drive with the available space - something I recommend doing right away.The second display runs in standard Windows dual-monitor mode. This makes ""Extended Display"" quite useless in most scenarios. Unless you want to do something that requires no cursor or keyboard actions (such as watch a movie, or, umm, let the person sitting behind you watch a movie) then you'll be constantly battling for control. Think of a single workstation with two monitors, two keyboards, two mice, and two people trying to do something and you'll get the idea. That being said, it could easily handle watching a compressed 1080p movie on one screen and Angry Birds Star Wars on the other without dropping a frame.A final negative thought is how difficult reinstalling Windows will be. I think it would have been simple enough to include a $10 ""Reinstall/Recovery"" USB stick with a $1600 unit. When the day comes to format this bad boy it's going to be a battle royale. Just looking at the ASUS driver web site (which was down most of the day) makes me cringe.There are some things I like about it. Another reviewer mentioned the fact that one screen gets all gummed with finger-prints and the other stays nice and clean, I agree wholeheartedly. My overall impression of Windows 8 on a touchscreen (and this isn't my first) is that it's really great for goofing off with things like paint or games, but you're not going to get any serious work done with it.In the end, it's like a mullet: Business in the front, party in the back! (but not at the same time)UPDATE 01-22-2013: The last round of Windows updates turned my screen rotation off again. It was easy enough to fix, from ""tablet"" mode you need to go to the screen resolution control panel and turn it back on. I think the way the ASUS software interacts with Windows 8 is the most annoying part of this laptop. The help of ""Taichi VIP support"" is laughable, which means this could be a real lemon for a basic user. If you're willing to have to goof around with it from time to time then it's fine.","January 17, 2013",0

laptops,Could be better,"_____ ""_____""",R2O7JI6ZY6KH1T,3,"I met a guy in Chengdu doing some work for a big ""Century City"" thing there; he somehow got ahold of one of these - anyway, you wonder how I got it and that's how. To sum up, it's a good idea and all but I'd rather have a twist/yoga-type. You can't even write on the inner screen - you have to flip the thing down for touch features, then flip it back up for typing, over and over - it sucks; no swiping through Windows 8 and then typing something or whatever - not unless you want to flip or run behind your computer over and over. It also doesn't feel equivalent to ipad balance/feel when in tablet mode, it feels like you're holding two stacked ipads or something - and you can feel more heat and churning (vibrations/sounds) of the computer more. This one says it's 11.6 inches but mine is around 13"", which just makes the whole thing feel too awkwardly large (and heavy) to hold - maybe 11.6"" is a better feel. I don't see how one could not fear the outer screen getting dinged up without some screen protector, and the pen has to use batteries - which sucks. It is indeed a good, thin, non-touch laptop with an awesome view on its non-touch screen, with a permanently-exposed-to-the-elements very nice crisp Windows tablet on the other side of the top. Hopefully some people will find some good use for this type of setup; I'm sure it has some awesome uses that I just haven't needed but others do.","November 26, 2012",0

laptops,solid value - but sleep-mode-battery issue,Machine Head,RQ93QEX44UYL8,3,"Previous tablet experience: 2 years with a 1st-Gen Ipad and then a recent purchase of a Lenovo Thinkpad 2, which I returned to the seller because of a broken speaker as well as other dissatisfactions. Laptop experience: a 2-year old Lenovo 14-inch Thinkpad and a Dell Latitude, both of which I am very satisfied with. Skype experience: several laptops and an Iphone 4s.Overall assessment -- As a general-use tablet, it's still a good option at the price I paid ($500). Everything but the 'sleep mode' works as it should and the tradeoff of the 'additional' weight (compared to a 10-inch tablet) for the bigger (11.5 inch) screen size and therefore bigger attached-keyboard, are well worth it. It has the basic components for an in-between tablet and a laptop for business trips and daily tossing into the briefcase. However, there are some areas in which the quality is less than desirable -- performance of the microphone on Skype calls (compared to my Iphone 4s), the mediocre responsiveness of the touchpad, and the non-functional 'sleep mode' (which drains the battery in 12 hours), make it a questionable purchase -- were it not for the digital pen -- but will you really use that?Likes:- The 11.5 inch screen is definitely more 'comfortable' to read and edit work-documents and to write notes on, than a 10-inch screen. Unlike other reviewers, I do not mind a larger, heavier tablet. However, if I were seeking a pure-tablet experience, and did need a keyboard for constructing reports or complex emails, the lighter 10-inch tablets have an advantage for travel.- The dockable keyboard -- The keyboard feels okay and my typing experience on it has been very good. It provides an excellent combination with the tablet and really enhances the overall functionality in several ways -- It provides a ready, secure 'stand' for the tablet, and yet I can still pop the tablet out for those situations in which I want ONLY a tablet, and do not want a keyboard.- Speakers -- MUCH better than the speakers on the TP2 (again, probably because the bigger device, at 11.5 inch, can carry bigger speakers). I can actually listen to music on this device, without earbuds!- built-in video-cam and camera functions work fine. Photos display fine.- digital pen: Competing 'convertibles' either do not have a digital pen, or they have other quality issues. If having a digital pen is a 'must' , then the Samsung Ativ 500T is still a good choice overall.Dislikes:1) Biggest issue is 'sleep mode' - it will drain the battery within a day (Lots of complaints about this on various websites). Contacted a Samsung CSR and he was unable to offer a fix. May be a bios problem.2) Touchpad on the attachable-keyboard is a little insensitive when dragging my finger along it to move the cursor on the screen - However, the touchpad is very responsive to a single tap of the fingertip and the buttons function about as well as I expected for a budget convertible. Touchpad 'buttons' (under the surface) require a 'firm click' - more pressure required than I would like. But given that one always has the option of simply touching the screen, this isn't that much of an issue.3) Microphone seems to be poor -- after successive Skype calls, switching between an Apple Iphone 4s and the Ativ 500T made it apparent that the microphone in the Ativ 500T is a step down in quality.Typeface on the screen is grey,and never a true 'black' -- screen contrast isn't great, but it is not a problem. It is sufficient. Photographs show up fine and video is okay too.There is some flex in the screen and a somewhat 'cheap' feel to the construction overall, but not so bad as to be an issue. (The Lenovo TP2 was much more stiff and seemed likely to be scratchproof and hence felt more durable).","June 27, 2013",0
laptops,Samsung Ativ with Windows 8 OS (ARM Processor),Queenie,R28IMCH287F7V9,3,"This device gives conventional users practicality. While the Atom processor has it's limits for functionality, I find that the Samsung Ativ has many basic uses. For one, it comes with a built-in stylus which is useful for storage. It stores right into the tablet portion of the device. The keyboard that attaches is useful but has functionality problems. As discussed in other posts, I have found I too have the same issue and can relate. The keyboard makes a noise when it detaches and attaches to the keyboard, thus, it is problematic in two ways. One, that it does not stay electronically attached, meaning that it doesn't work unless you have it on a plat, hard surface and pushed in securely. Two, that the annoyance from the keyboard loosely attaching could be a problem while in a meeting or in a quiet library or other environments where it would be unsuitable for a loud obnoxious tone. (you can turn this off, however, you will find that it is another annoyance when you are typing and unaware that the keyboard is not functioning.)Aside from the keyboard issue, there are other key factors one should be aware of when deciding to purchase. The first one being the processor. It is an Intel Atom Z2760 processor that I have in my model which is a 500T. It runs 32 bit Windows 8. The problems with this is that I am finding that it is somewhat slow for a tablet. I find it more user-friendly while accessing the internet or playing music. I would definitely not recommend running more than one application on it at a time.Nevertheless, it's sleek design and coloring choices are catchy and it has both a front and rear facing camera which is also convenient. The keys on the keyboard are also low-profile and when they are working, they are rather delightful to type with. As for the functionality overall, I would recommend light to medium workload that this tablet can handle. The pricepoint is a little spendy though for the functionality though. I recently bought my husband a Microsoft Surface that was about 300 dollars more and this is no match for it. The Surface can run games such as Tortchlight, Skyrim, and Diablo 3. This tablet cannot. There is also a difference in the edition of Windows though as the Suface was the Pro edition. The Windows version is supposed to be a full on version of Windows 8 but it seems to be lacking functionality of a true Windows 8 OS and by what I mean is that a few web pages and applications for some reason state they cannot be opened that can be opened on the Microsoft Surface.However, this tablet does nicely for someone in school as it is able to pull up Office and a full browser. I also think it is great that it is also a touch screen but for the price and functionality I was looking for, I opted to buy the Surface Pro as it ran programs that I needed to be able to run. My 3 out of 5 stars would be a 4 if the product had a bit more RAM to run things a bit faster. Overall, for the average user I would definitely recommend this device. If your looking for more functionality and processing power then go for a Surface Pro. Not the RT version of the Surface which is a whole different story. The Ativ is better overall in my opinion better than RT version of Windows on the cheaper Surface model.","March 17, 2013",0
laptops,Disruptive technology?,George Nathanson,RDWE81U2JCAIH,3,"I have owned some for of this unit for one month now and I have to say I really love the concept. A powerful tablet with the power of a mid range laptop. The addition of the SPen was was the driving factor for me to purchase this. I was only hoping to be able to work with Visio, and Sketchbook and have found myself using the ATIV for much more. Once I was able to clean off some bloatware (such as Norton) speeds improved greatly. I have the Office 2013 RTM installed and am beginning to use the ATIV more than any other device I own.Now the bad: Samsung pushed a bios update a couple of weeks ago, and it managed to corrupt something so my first unit had to be sent to repair (Samsung has been very good to deal with) apparently they need to replace the MB so I'll have to wait another week. When the Keyboard dock bundle started showing up on Amazon, I decided I'd buy a replacement and surprise my wife for Christmas (and be able to have a replacement in the mean time). The new unit showed up from Amazon with the keyboard dock which is a nice addition for writing emails in bed and when no table surface is available you can type with it in you lap. Unfortunately there is a defect in the bezel of the new tablet. Near the SD slot the bezel is bulging outward.Pros:Very capable processorRuns most Win8 Compatible appsgood size for apps that require screen real estateSPen (love it)Keyboard dock (for typing from your lap)Built in peripheralsBright screenBattery life very goodSamsung updating drivers regularlyCons:Weight (Esp with KBD dock)Build Quality QCScreen DPI (should be higher)Lack of working NFC (As far as I know only LTE version has proper antenna)Soft keyboard wonky (no swipe / voice input)Slippery exteriorBloatwareWin 8 (Should still be in Beta)Lack of accessories (Temporary)Not sure what color the case really isAll in all I have high hopes for this device, I just hope I can get one that is more reliable.","November 27, 2012",0

However, any movement such as tilting the screen or typing on an uneven surface disconnected communication with the dock.

laptops,Very poor customer support on a faulty product,"Dennis E. Miller ""There's no 'alternative' to...",R1AW32GHVCIDFA,3,"***Update***Samsung contacted me and offered to replace this tablet with the newer branded ATIV Tab 5, which is the exact same unit with a new name and model number. The only difference between this model and the replacement is a few software changes. The exchange took longer than it should have but the new unit did arrive as promised a week and a half after shipping my faulty unit back. By that time, I had already chosen to sell the replacement and use that money to purchase a smaller Windows 8.1 tablet from Dell that would better fit my needs. Be aware that this tablet will run most of your Windows 8 apps that run in the modern UI with little-to-no lag and will operate most desktop apps with no trouble, but its processor will not handle the same workload one may expect of a good laptop or desktop; neither was it meant to. Because Samsung finally stepped up and took responsibility for the horrible scenario their service and customer support teams put me in, I upgraded my rating to 3 stars, but this problem should never have happened to begin with. This is a decent tablet for light to moderate use and would make a great starter tablet for someone interested in Windows tablets but wishing to retain the ability to run some desktop apps. Keep that in mind when choosing to buy one._____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________My initial review for this tablet was very positive; however, I spoke far too soon. When I received the ATIV 500T it had a recurring issue with dropping hidden networks on restart, necessitating the reentry of connection criteria to access the Internet and the Bluetooth card continually failed any outgoing FTP transaction, even though it had no trouble accepting an incoming one. I spoke to customer support sever times over this issue in the first few weeks I had to tablet, refreshed Windows 8 and even did a full factory restore at their recommendation, all to no avail. I was promised the issue would be reported to technical support and never heard another word back from them, even when I initiated contact again a few months later. After roughly 5 1/2 months of using the tablet, the display started to develop image retention in the upper left corner of the screen. Whenever I would switch between screens, an image of whatever had been in the upper-left corner from the previous screen would be visible still on the new screen for a few minutes. Within a week of noticing this, the issue worsened to a 1/4 inch band around all four edges of the display. At that point I contacted the same person with customer support I had dealt with before, and after asking me to refresh Windows again (I don't know what it is with those people, but reinstalling the OS is NOT the answer to EVERYTHING!) he arranged for the tablet to be shipped to a 3rd party repair center to have the display replaced. I got the tablet back almost exactly a week later with two cracks in the plastic frame around the outside edge of the display and the screen showing the exact same image retention issue it had when it left my hand the week before. To be fair, the image retention was back to the milder presence it had when the problem first started, but worsened right back to the same 1/4 inch band on all four edges of the display within a week. I contacted Samsung customer support at which point they filed a claim with UPS, even though I clearly explained to this representative that the tablet was properly packaged in its original box with its original packing material, all of which was packed in a second box and both boxes were in exceptional condition upon receipt. Almost a week later, the representative called and left a voice mail, telling me that UPS refuted the claim and thanked me for giving her the opportunity to help me! I immediately called customer support back and was told that they would be happy to send the tablet BACK to Intelisol, Inc. (the 3rd party repair center) to have the display replaced AGAIN but would take zero responsibility for the damage to my unit! I got the email address for the office of the president of Samsung Electronics America's customer service department and immediately sent a very heated email outlining how Samsung needs to be responsible for the 3rd party organization THEY hire to do warranty work on products purchased by their customers, which was sent four days ago and still has been completely ignored. I resent the message two days later with an automated return receipt request and a notice of read request, both of which I got from addresses within Samsung (tchoe@sea.samsung.com & hnam@sea.samsung.com) but no one has yet to even respond to my request for help. I have been a loyal customer of Samsung's for many years, owning two TV's, Blue-Ray players, and always the latest Samsung Android flagship smartphone (I currently have the Galaxy Note 3, which I have only had to two weeks), and as such, I am appalled at the lack of concern for the deplorable lack of customer service displayed by Samsung in this issue. I am filing a complaint with the Better Business Bureau (unfortunately for them, I kept copies of every single email communication I have had regarding this unit from day one) pertaining to the company's complete lack of owning up to their responsibility with this situation. I highly recommend anyone thinking about a Windows 8 tablet purchase from Dell, Lenovo, or any one of the many computer manufacturers who stand behind their products with quality support when things do go wrong.","May 3, 2013",0
laptops,"Tablet is okay, dock is horrible",Chad,RL0FL54STTICB,3,"I was really excited to get my ATIV; only to find that the dock absolutely did not work.

Even then they keyboard never worked, if I held it in just the right position I could write one or two words before it disconnected. A friend of mine ordered the same one, so I swapped keyboards to see if that would make a difference, but it didn't. His tablet by the way had all sorts of issues with freezing, shutting down randomly, and in general not functioning.As a long time Samsung fan, this was a big disappointment.

After doing all the updates and every work around we could find, we could not resolve the freezing issue.Another temporary annoyance is there is no keyboard or accessories available at this time since it is brand new.With a $700 price tag freezing all the time is unacceptable. Samsung customer service was not great either.I guess if all you want is strictly a tablet then this could be great, but if you want something that is a little more versatile, comfortable and functional spend a little bit more on an ultrabook/tablet like the Lenovo Yoga 13 (which is what I ended up returning the Ativ for).","December 12, 2012",0

The major issue i have with this win 8 tablet is its just plain underpowered. I fouind myself going to the task manager every couple of hours and closing all running apps becasue it started to get very slow. The dual core atom is definitely an improvement from the last gen but still not enough to run win 8 and multi task. For very basic use i think it could be a nice piece. The design is very cool. I like the tablet itself. Lots of ports, light in weight and very cool layout for the size. Another issue i had was the AC powert input on the tablet. If it was fully inserted it would sitll stick out about an 1/8 inch. When i wiggled it around it lost charging status. Now being my co worker has the same one with no issue i assumed it was jsut an issue with mine. The keyboard dock is pretty useful but its very light and cheap feeling for $129+. The tablet out weighs it and it seems not so balanced when opened up. Other than that battery life was excellent and overall a nice go at a win 8 11.6 tablet. I did return mine though for a Acer S7 11.6 which is $400 more but comes packed with an i5 and is just a convertible/ultrabook.

laptops,Not What Your Hoping for.....,Amazon Customer,R17K1KKT6XP6P1,3,"If your looking for a tablet that is a "" Jack of all trades, but master of none"" then this the one. While it can run x86 windows applications the 2 Gigs of ram really is only 1 gig as the OS its self uses 1 gig just to run, meaning any application you run will bog down quickly. I think if they went with 4 gigs the performance would be drastically improved.Also the processor and or eMMC memory is slow as well, I had to do a full restore and this process took 2 HOURS and 20 MINUTES to run. I had to do this very same thing on an older dual core Intel processor and a 5400 rpm 500 GB hard drive and it only took about 30 minutes to complete. I ran a system refresh last night verses the complete wipe and that only took 28 minutes to complete so if you have to repair try the refresh 1st other wise be prepared to wait around for a few hours.Samsung's Software updater for me was broken out of the box so I had to download a patch directly from the website to get it download driver updates that it needed. I still can't get the windows update from Samsung to install. I've left running for 2 hours and as yet it still hasn't installed.I am thinking of contacting Samsung just to make sure that there isn't something wrong with my unit to confirm all of the issues I am having.I do like the screen and keyboard, but then again I've been using android tablets and convertibles for 2 years so having the extra room feels very spacious.If anything changes I'll update this review.","November 30, 2012",0

For instance the sleep/hibernation seldom works. The system occasionally freezes and a reboot is required. There are regular freezes with Chrome.In terms of aesthetics, the power connector is on the bottom left, proving to be a very annoying spot for when cradling while charging. The dock is quite expensive.

laptops,Unresolved WIFI Issue Still Prevalent,Don B.,RM5TEPSA42BM0,3,"This tablet runs well up until a new update gets installed.It will act buggy for awhile until it finally pulls it together.I have been also dealing with WIFI taking 2 minutes to reconnect.I am incredibly disappointed with Samsung Technical Support as they seem to be completely at a loss regarding any fix whatsoever.Then they try to convince you that no one else is having WIFI issues but I did a simple Google and found tons of people are having the same problem.I have been talking to their tech support since last November.Last I spoke with them, they wanted me to send my tablet in for repair since I am the only weirdo having this problem.Well maybe someone at Samsung needs to use Google, Bing, or Yahoo! every once and awhile.I am not sending my tablet in.I read elsewhere from another owner that this is a known issue that got elevated to Samsung Engineers.So why is tech support acting like they've never heard of it then?I would not recommend purchasing this tablet until WIFI connectivity is addressed.","February 14, 2013",0
laptops,I CAN'T PRINT!!!,Fancy-pntz,R2BK4CLDAMVT34,3,"I was so excited about the Chromebook. I bought it to replace my old laptop, which doesn't comes on anymore. I'm a college student and don't really need anything major just for typing my papers and getting on the web. I wasn't planning on using this for gaming or anything thing like that. So far I've had this for a couple of months and sadly tonight is the the first time I needed to print something from it. All the other times I printed from school, anyways what I found out is that I can't use a classic printer to print from here. Meaning I CANNOT plug a printer on to here and print. I have to either buy a Cloud Ready Printer or use a PC as a host. TO us my PC as a host, the PC that doesn't turns on anymore, I would have to download the cloud print software and then have the PC on every time I need to Print. WTH is that!!! I promise if I would've known I had to go through this much to do a basic computer function then I've gotten the ACER. But by all means if you have a laptop that can be your host or a Cloud Ready Printer then this is a overall good computer...well so far. I regret waiting so long to figure this out because now I can't return it.","November 10, 2013",0

The operating system is just not ready for prime time and I would be afraid to purchase this product again.A comment from FAX on this review was very helpful. It suggested reinstalling the Chrome OS and provided a link on how to do it. I was able to successfully reinstall and my issue with freezing was resolved. Thank you FAX.

laptops,"Worth it for the Warehouse price I paid, but probably not much more",soontobepcv,R36AJ11XACF31E,3,"Me: a person who originally wanted a tablet for browsing on the couch. I couldn't get past the lack of a physical keyboard.Along comes the Chromebook, which for roughly half the original price (and less than a Nexus 7"") seems like a great value proposition. That is, unless you spend considerable time browsing on it. I don't mind the 11.6"" screen, but the brightness (200 nit) and resolution are pretty bad. It reminds me of Samsung's own Galaxy Tab 3: a similarly disappointing screen, although that is a similar resolution over a much smaller space. My comparison, I LOVE the bright, saturated display on my Galaxy S3.That said, I would not hesitate to recommend this (at this price) to family members who are not as picky about their technology, or especially if they need a budget solution get on the Internets and want a physical keyboard.","February 13, 2014",0
laptops,Great - If You're A Computer Illiterate,Amazon Customer,R1W8AXS5NK7PK1,3,"OK - here's my take on this product. Pros: Small, light, comes on quickly, is basically Linux with a Chrome overlay (so it's pretty much virus free), great battery life. Now cons: Keyboard lacks some pretty vital keys (delete for one), too many keyboard shortcuts (you can't remember them all), touchpad is 'quirky' (and I'm being kind here - it sucks!), screen is dim (even at max brightness), needs more memory and a bigger hard drive (the cloud isn't my favorite for storing personal info). Overall, if you've never used a computer, this is a nice intro devise. For experienced users, it's not worth the time or trouble to get (basically) a tablet with a keyboard for around $250. I got this to see what the spin was all about. Now, I guess I can gift it to my grandkids come Christmas 'cause I sure don't have a use for it.....","November 13, 2013",0

However, I am extremely disappointed that, at this point, it will not wake up after going to sleep without a long power button press followed by a short power button press. Apparently, I'm not the only one who has issues with this. At this point, the options are 1) wait for an update (Samsung can't tell me whether it is a hardware or software issue) or 2) send it back to them. I don't have time for that. It is amazing to me that they can't tell simply tell what the problem is because so many others have it.It will also not stream Netflix. This is not that big of a deal to me.

laptops,Great but SECURITY issue and poor video playback,Online Shopper,R15WE73QIHXGNL,3,"Love this laptop so far except for a few issues below. Granted, it only runs Google Chrome, but these days almost everything I use goes through Google Chrome.Pros: - Price - Good keyboard - Fast on / off from sleep - No bloatware, viruses, updates, etc. (think Windows) - Just worksCons: - Needs parental controls (see below)!! - Too slow to handle Vimeo HD videos - Case is plastic (ok for price) - Screen could be a bit bigger (fill out the bezel) - Features come and go ... like it's in betaPARENTAL CONTROLSAs mentioned above, they need better parental controls so I can let my kids use the device for basic word processing, dictionary and calculator (and perhaps look up stuff on Wikipedia). I'd love to be able to disable access to Settings and certain apps for my kids, plus restrict Internet access to Drive and Wikipedia for example.SECURITY ISSUEAlso, there is a big security issue on Chrome (not just Chromebooks). If you go under Password management in settings, you can click on any of the saved passwords and simply see them without having to re-enter your password. That means any of your kids or people who might be using your machine will be able to see your saved password. That's CRAZY!! At minimum they should ask for you password again.FEATURES DISAPPEARINGThe Chrome OS doesn't seem to be very stable. Features such as going back to the previous page using a three finger swipe to the left disappeared in the latest update (which was a very handy feature). Worries me that such core functionality just comes and goes.TIPSCaps Lock - Press the Alt+Search key to enable CAPS LOCK... more tips here: [...]","November 2, 2012",0
laptops,"The best chromebook option on a budget, but that's not saying much",Robert Wallace,RV0Q0Y83XSODY,3,"I like the idea of the chromebook, and Samsung does it well. No spinning hard drive makes for a fast boot-up time, but really this is more of a ""typewriter tablet."" It's infuriating when you find incompatible file formats (and you will), but I did find myself surprised with just how much this could do. The updates are great, but Chrome OS cannot yet replace a traditional laptop.Good for browsing the internet and some other basic work. I use it for writing and am mostly satisfied. Since I've purchased it, the updates have made it twice as good as it was, but you really want to have an internet connection 100% of the time.In the past the synchronization has been a problem for some larger (89,000 word) documents.

laptops,Sent back for repair - Warning Take Pictures,Douglas Nielsen,R4CXM87LN26Q4,3,Stopped working after 5 months and sent back for repair. When customer service rep stated something in regards to if the unit was damaged the warranty would be voided I was a little taken back by the way she said it so I decided to take pictures of it before I mailed it off. The repair company Intersol or something like that stated the screen was cracked. It wasn't cracked when I sent it and they blamed it on shipping after I complained. I bubble wrapped it to where it should have been fine being dropped off a roof. Well UPS evidently became responsible. I am just upset that the repair company stated the screen was cracked when it wasn't & I am pretty sure UPS didn't break it either. Damaged boxes in a repair shop are usually not accepted in receiving. Supposedly a refurbished unit is being sent out.

Here's what I really liked about it:- Very light and portable. Heavier than an iPad but much lighter than any laptop that I've ever owned- Great keyboard feel- Great battery life with little noise (no fan)- Decent screen quality- Great for light tasks like emails and documentsWhat I didn't like about it:- While there are plenty of Chrome apps to choose from, none are to the quality of commercially available ones- Slow processor: good luck trying to stream or have multiple applications and windows (tabbed) open at the same time. It's the little processor that couldn't and that's my biggest gripeOverall, I wouldn't recommend it. The processor is much too slow for what I need for it.

I don't know if youtube's site is really the problem or not but after restart and logging it, it seems to be fine. The restarts happpen about 3-4 times per week with daily use. There's not much to the chromebook or the OS so i'm not sure what i am doing wrong here.The build quality is fine but expect thin, cheap plastic.

Mainly, it doesn't necessarily fit what I need to do as a laptop user. I'm big on recording and gaming, and this laptop absolutely isn't for that. The battery life is good, but if you leave the laptop to get too hot, then it has a knack for randomly freezing up and cutting off. It heats up very quickly because there is no built in fan, due to the size of the Chromebook. It is very light and easy to travel with, which was a plus because I am in the military and do a lot of traveling. However, I'd suggest looking into another laptop with and all around features and not something that limits you to Chrome OS.","September 9, 2013",0
laptops,Samsung cut corners in touchpad design,AW,RA3PLC4FYUOBH,3,"This is an OK product for its price. Its battery is good (but does not last as much as they promise). Due to google cloud storage you do not miss hard disk (though it gets very expensive after a point).My biggest complain is about the invisible button on the touch pad. You can click on the lower half of the touch pad to ""left click"". But in this product the button gets stuck. So it is as good as you are clicking and holding it down for a very very long time. Some times it does not come back unless you click a second time. I have three of these devices and ALL of them have the problem. So they probably have whole batch of faulty devices out there.Another problem with the touch pad is its ability to detect multi-touch. I have noticed that a lot of times it fails to detect multi-touch and you end up ""left clicking"" when you intend to write click. Samsung is trying to copy Apple Macs by providing only left click, but they need to realize that if they need to do a good job of it. A lot of people will prefer to have two separate buttons instead of one so it is ok to stick to old fashioned design.Another very serious flaw is that this device is UNACCEPTABLY (I cannot emphasize it more) slow when browsing pictures from my camera (connected via USB). It may be the software or the hardware, I do not know. But my 6 year old Toshiba laptop does a much better job of it.But it is a perfect device for people whose primary computing needs are email/facebook/netflix. Google docs is a really nice no-cost option for MS office if you are not an advanced/pro user. It serves me well for my basic spreadsheet and word-processor needs. What I truly miss is the Skype App. Wish Microsoft releases it soon.","July 18, 2013",0

mobile phone,encounter software problems,verymerry,RI2U38LY4Q31,3,"I used a Droid for about 1 week before getting a new one. It is indeed a great phone to use. very user friendly with their ""android tips"". the camera is pretty good and the sound quality is great. using the wifi and browsing the web is a piece of cake. Sad, the qwerty is a pain in the butt. the inset keys are not easy to press at all. i found myself missing a letter or adding doubles because i was pressing so firmly. I found using the electronic keyboard easier esp. if you like swype. unlike most sliders, where u can slide open with one hand, i had to use both hands to open. This phone was screwed on tight.I also don't like how the dialer would pop up when you are on a call, you would then need to hide it to reveal the contacts information. i wish the default was to show the dialer. now a days, most people do not dial numbers.I returned this phone because of software issues. I could only talk on the phone in speaker mode. For some reason the MIC doesn't recognize your voice without speaker mode. there was no work around even with a headset/earpiece. My friends still could not hear me on the other end. They can only hear me if i use the speaker phone. I performed two factory reset but the issue persisted. I even tried cleaning the mic with a needle. (which i read online fixed the problem for some people). i was close to rooting my phone but read online that this did not solve the issue. So i decided to just return it. If this phone worked perfectly, it makes a great phone. one more CON: this phone is pretty heavy. weighing almost 6 oz. it may not matter to those who travel lite, but when you have a purse full of other stuff, another 2-3 oz more, does hurt. esp when you're carrying your purse for upwards of 4 hours.","May 24, 2013",0

mobile phone,Nice phone - WARNING INTERNET CONNECTION REQUIRED!,Happ,R19GIIB345DWYA,3,"Nokia built a great phone with the C3-00.

With extreme difficulty, I was able to get it to connect via WIFI starting off at home. But as soon as I was out of range, or disconnected from WIFI, it jumps right to GPRS. And the transition back to WIFI is difficult to accomplish without re-booting the phone. This was not what I expected. On my current Win5 OS phone, I control the connection to GPRS and WIFI, and I can enable or disable as I please. So I ultimately sent the phone back. I specifically look for WIFI phones, but i must be able to control the connection. I refuse to purchase most new smartphones because they have a data package requirement. I am able to use my Win5 OS phone and connect when I can - and that suits me just fine.

Bluetooth works well with my MacBook Pro for file transfers, both sending music to the phone memory card and sending photos/videos from the phone to the MacBook. The bluetooth also works in our 2011 Toyota Sienna, at least as far as making and receiving calls, but the stereo music features do not work at all.

mobile phone,Interface sucks. Needs more buttons. Decent camera.,U Lala,R3KZQPXLWRFYHX,3,"Reception: Very good. Has two mics, one for talking and one in the back for noise cancellation, so call quality is very good on both ends. The speaker next to your ear is loud and clear.Body: The screen is glass so you don't need a screen protector. The anodized/painted aluminum finish is sturdy, but way too slippery. I would strongly recommend getting a silicone case or something.Camera: Shame on Nokia for cramming 12MP into a 1/1.8"" sensor. I'd be happy with 8. This practice should be heavily frowned upon. The autofocus is very fast but not exactly razor sharp. ISO performance is decent, which is expected for a 1/1.8"" sensor. The flash is pretty weak, so this camera has to crank up the ISO to compensate, which unfortunately degrades photo quality. I personally prefer a wider angle, around 28mm but that is just personal preference. That said, it is still probably the best camera available on a phone. Pictures come out pretty bland and soft on default settings. I hate that you can't save the default processing settings to ""Vivid"" and a little higher contrast. Every time you turn on the camera it resets these settings to factory defaults.Interface: It often takes too many clicks to go places and type things. The touchscreen sensors aren't as well tuned as any of the iphones. I always feel like I could use more buttons. For instance, if you're using the music player, and the phone auto-locked but you want to change the track, you have to unlock it before you can do anything. Same if you want to turn the player off. On my old Sony Ericsson candybar phone, you can press the play/pause button because there is a dedicated play/pause button. If you want to change the track, you hold down the volume button and it changes track, or tap the volume button to change volume. On the N8 if you hold down the volume rocker it rapidly changes the volume. There is also a serious lack of dedicated ""cancel"" or ""back"" button, commonly found on almost all Samsung or Sony Ericsson phones. What's the point of having a touch screen you're still only going have two ""soft keys"" up front and hide most of the options in a submenu?Organizer: I hate that you can't set an alarm to recursively ring on Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday. Yes you can set it to ring on ""workdays"" only and then set the ""workdays"" but I like to have several custom alarms and this doesn't do it for me. The workaround is to set 3 different alarms on the calendar on Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday, and then make them recurring every week. The problem with the calendar alarm is that if it rings and you don't hit snooze in time, it will not ring again. It will auto shut off. Lame. And why, in the Notes app, do I have to click 3 different things to even begin typing? It should be one click. ONE! Or two at the most.GPS Navigation: It takes about 10-20 seconds for the GPS to track down your location. It's great that you can download maps and use it offline, but the interface and user experience is much inferior to Google Maps, and the same can be said for the search feature. So, I just use Google Maps. But yeah if you're stuck in the middle of nowhere with no cell/internet reception, at least you can figure out where you are.Web surfing: The default web browser is sluggish and annoying, but Opera Mobile is a very suitable (albeit buggy and crashy) replacement. Too bad Opera can't do Flash yet but at least it can do Youtube.Texting: The keyboard is OK, not the best ever but I can live with it.Battery Life: With moderate useage it will not last more than 2 days.This phone will not satisfy your thirst for instant gratification. It will do almost everything, just not necessarily as well as you would like. $550 is a lot to pay, but who wants to carry around an extra camera everywhere? I suppose if you are of the purse-carrying variety, this should not pose a problem. Other than that, a mediocre picture is better than no picture, and a decent picture is even better. I think I will keep it, but if I had to do it all over again, I would do more research into other models.UPDATE: 11/18 Just found out about an application called Swype, which makes the keyboard about a billion times better (only works in Landscape mode, Portrait mode is the same).Apparently the alarm can only snooze for ~45 minutes, which is just plain sucky. I like a good hour and a half of snoozing, darn it! I suppose I could work around it by setting a second alarm 54 minutes after the first one... yes...UPDATE: 11/27 Just found out you can set your own scene mode in camera settings and save it as the default scene mode, so yes you can save the settings.","November 13, 2010",0
mobile phone,"Fantastic Camera, But The UI Is Holding It Back",Douglas Auchter,R8YYK7E54ZJHA,3,"I have been a Nokia user for years, owning a number of their Symbian phones (N75-3, N95-3, E71-2, E72-2, N97-3). I was eager to get this because it appeared as if it was Symbian 5th (S^1) done correctly which is what I was looking for, not to mention the camera really sucked me in. It's been a month and a half since I began using this as my primary device, and I've spent considerable time using it and comparing it to my N97 and Samsung Captivate (Galaxy S).Overall, the N8 doesn't appear to me to be a completely finished product software wise. While comparing it to my N97, I noticed that a number of features that I found very to be useful and loved were gone, like the customizable equalizer in the music player (I'm hoping Nokia gives it back to us in the next firmware update), and the GPS Data application that we always had. Still, there were other things that made me wonder what the software developers were doing during the testing phase of Symbian^3, like how there's no way to send an MMS message that gets stuck in your Outbox, or how there's no menu option to add a song to a playlist from the Now Playing screen like there was in S^1. There are plenty of other examples I can give as well, not to mention all the inconsistencies across the UI. But it's not all bad. In fact there's a lot to like about it.Here's what I liked about it:The camera is fantastic but it will take some time to really master it. Nevertheless its really easy to take a very good quick shot of something, and did I mention how real the coloring is? The days of fake reds and yellows are gone. Video recording is very good. It may not be quite as smooth as the iPhone 4, but there's no overexposure problems, coloring is real, and the audio is by far the best on the market. You can edit your photos and videos right on the phone, unlike with my Captivate, and thank you Nokia for still putting a very good camera button on the side of the phone unlike some other phone makers who don't have one at all (I can't stand that about a lot of Android phones). Reception is typical Nokia aka top notch, and phone calls are crystal clear. I love Nokia's Profile's that allow you to personalize your ringers and tones, and create and customize your own so you can have different ones for different times of the day. Build quality is very good; the best next to the E71. HDMI will actually display the whole UI on your TV unlike certain Android phones which only display your videos. It has a microSD card slot that's easily accessible and USB OTG which allows you to connect any FAT32 formatted flash drive to the phone which is really cool. Finally we have multiple homescreens on Symbian, and you can still create folders in the application menu to organize all your apps just like we've always been able to do. I love the home key that doubles as a notification light and I'm glad its a physical key. Ovi Sync which backs up your contacts, calendar and notes to a server is great. Ovi Maps (v3.06 which does not come with the phone because it's still in beta but has multitouch) is really good. The GPS on this is the best I have ever seen. The single speaker is actually pretty loud (though my N95-3 still sounds louder). Finally we have threaded SMS although it's not done properly. Video playback is very good and it has a long list of formats that will work. The music player UI looks good but is missing key features that were there in my N97 that I always used. However, I really like how disconnecting your headphones while music is playing pauses the song. Also, the volume seems to have more intervals than in previous Nokia's. I like how this isn't always connected via a data connection like a lot of Android devices (My Captivate eats through data because so many apps are constantly downloading information, like Facebook, Twitter, Weather apps, etc). Haptic feedback is really good, and at times you will really think you're actually pressing a real button. Love how it has a front facing camera unlike practically everything you get today from the carriers (thank you unlocked phone market). Love the screen saver that shows the time and any notifications. The battery will get you through the day as long as you aren't syncing email at all times during the day or running any homescreen widgets all the time like Accuweather. I was pleasantly surprised about that, although, if you're going out on Friday night and you did a lot of web browsing during the day, charge it before you go out. Ovi Suite, as much as it still needs work, is really nice to have since you can use it to back up your phone data and download maps to your phone for Ovi Maps. I love how the phone can connect to your computer as a storage device and NOT have to be used through a specific software like iTunes. I like how you can set any song you have as a ringtone, and you can do this through the music player too (again thanks to it being unlocked). The email client has a great implementation of pinch to zoom unlike the Gmail client on my Captivate which has none or the email application on it, which does a poor job of it. Leave it to Nokia to give you multitasking without rules or limits, and I like the familiar Symbian feel it still has to it.What I didn't like:There is no customizable equalizer to fine tune the sound in the music player (only presets that don't do much of anything). The non-removable battery, no matter what you try and tell me, will always be something I don't like. Don't bother using red-eye reduction before taking a photo because it just makes the subjects' eyes look weird. Just edit the photo afterwards. I personally find the 3.5"" display to be a little too narrow (a 3.7"" would have been better. There are no stereo speakers like on previous Nseries. There's a number of missing menu options that should otherwise be there, the settings menu needs to be restructured badly, and there are too many UI inconsistencies. The Facebook and Twitter apps are terrible compared to ones you get on Android. There is no portrait QWERTY, the landscape QWERTY is not designed like it should be (like the ones on Android, iOS), and the current keyboard takes up the entire display. Certain aspects of the UI are too small to be finger friendly. I find the homescreen switch button to be pointless and think it should be a customizable shortcut instead. The email client is slow and does not display HTML correctly all the time. 256MB of RAM is acceptable but 512MB of RAM would have been much better for every type of user. But I do push this phone hard. Kinetic scrolling speed is not consistent across the UI. In some applications a quick flick will give you a fast scroll, and in other applications it will give you a medium pace scroll. The phone is slower than it should be at times, like when browsing through your loaded SMS Inbox, and when Ovi Sync is running. There are the unnecessary annoying connection notifications which I can't stand, and I don't like how tapping on a link in a text message results in a pop-up instead of simply opening the link. The web browser needs at lot of work UI and page loading wise. I'm still getting all those (you are now leaving a secure website...) prompts when I just want to get to my web page. There is a slight hesitation on the first pinch to zoom in the photo gallery. Only 3 homescreens while Android has 7. The camera UI needs work, and by work, I mean completely redone. No LED flash means no flashlight/video light. There's no touch to focus in the camera for stills or video recording, and you will be cleaning the camera lens a lot. The number of apps available for the U.S. market is a joke compared to Android and iOS's app catalog. Smart dialing only looks for names instead of both names and numbers.As much as I really wanted to love this phone, I can't because of the software and all the things that were left out. Until the software gets updated and the UI gets redone, and all the things that are missing get put back in, I can only give this 3 stars overall, even though it definitely has the potential to get 5. Don't get me wrong, I like this phone, and I'm going to keep it, but I'm not completely happy with it yet. Maybe in January I will be. As far as recommending this, it's the best choice if you want a camera phone, but until the app store starts getting the top 100 apps in the Android Market and iTunes App Store, I really can't recommend this to anyone in the U.S. market who just wants a nice smartphone.For those who have Nokia phones, and are looking at getting this, it's better than anything else Nokia has offered at this point. But that's really not saying much. Symbian^3 is good, but not where it needs to be. Thankfully, there is an update planned for Q1 next year that will bring a lot of changes, but only a few which are known at this point, like the portrait QWERTY. I would wait until that update comes, and then make your decision. Also, there is a second update planned for Q3 next year where the UI will be redone.For those who have Android devices or an iPhone, I highly doubt that you'll like Symbian as it is now. In fact, I know you won't since I also own the Captivate. UI wise it's a step backwards and the app store doesn't have anywhere near the number of U.S. centric apps the other two platforms have. Unless you really want a great camera/media device/phone, I really think that you'll be more disappointed with this than anything, even with all the little things the N8 can do that others can't. Maybe after the upcoming software update, it might be more appealing, but again, if you want apps, there aren't that many good ones. Try it for yourself though. Maybe you'll like it.","December 21, 2010",0
mobile phone,Great Hardware/ Questionable OS,C. Hernandez,R2BY60RYXEM52S,3,"Had this phone for over 3 weeks but just had to return it. Let me tell you this phone has a great quality build and great spec's. The overall hardware is incomparable and really stands out in comparison to that of the competition. The 12 megapixel camera takes outstanding pictures and can easily replace a ""point and shoot"" camera.. Honestly the phone is an honest good buy but the Symbian OS ruines the whole user experience.I have been an avid Nokia user since the release of the Nokia N95. From there on I have owned the N82, N86 and jumped to the N900 last year. After being spoiled using the Maemo OS found in the N900 I honestly hoped that the Symbian's OS update would catch up and even exceed Maemo which has now evolved into MeeGo thanks to it's partnership with Intel. Sadly Symbian stays way behind and I found myself wanting to throw the phone across the room at times due to the various frustrations it caused.Constant freezing, long wait time, and constant clicking from one thing to another just to get a task done. I love you Nokia but Android and Apple's iOs have left you behind. I'm only hoping that Nokia's next flagship phone has MeeGo OS as it's software platform and maybe I'll jump back and be the happy customer I once was when owning a Nokia device.Overall if your looking to own a phone with excellent call quality, outstanding hardware/build and looking to replace your ""point and shoot"" camera with a phone then go ahead and make your purchase. But if your out looking for a great overall Smartphone then I recommend you look away from anything running Symbian.","December 9, 2010",0
mobile phone,"Nokia N8 in paper marvelous, out of production lines a mess.",manny277227,R2E3HQ6NLD2L59,3,"I will begin by saying that I have been a Nokia fan for several years mainly for the type of designs, materials and built quality of the brand phones. My latest device was the E71 (Unlocked version made in Finland) which I consider to be the best phone that the company has produced. Symbian operating system structure has never been an issue for me since I rather like a stable OS that has been proven efficient for several years now.I am a Mechanical Engineer which has held several positions requiring a very good attention to details, deep troubleshooting thinking process and analysis and evaluation of different types of equipment failures. Currently I held a position in the Nuclear Industry.So far I have gone through three (3) Nokia N8 in less than a month with all the units shown significant signs that this device is not being put together well. I will say that the Nokia N8, in my personal opinion, is a well design device that separates itself from the rest of mass produced devices currently in the market. The phone specs are very impressive and the materials guarantee a long durability. However all this looks wonderful on paper but what is coming out from the production line is far, far from what was conceived in the design table. This phone particular design, in my personal opinion, requires a very well controlled manufacturing process to maintain the quality of the finished device. This strict quality control appears to be missing at least on the units I have bought.All the phones I am referenced in here were bought at AMAZON.COM as brand new units and I received them with the Nokia seal intact on the shipped boxes. All the units I have received are MADE IN CHINA which I will not rush to conclude it is the main contributor to the phone issues but it probably is.The first unit was my first disappointment right out of the box. This device came with the unlock sliding key significantly loose and the rattling was very annoying (something that I might have live with it for a $100.00 phone but not for what is expected to be a high end product priced at over $500.00) . I also noted visible miss-alignments on both end caps in relation to the main cover body. So I returned this unit without further use of it.The second unit kept showing what appears to be a trend on this product. I found two (2) visible marks on both sides of the phone cases next to the ring that appears to secure the phone screen (it appears that excessive effort had to be made to finalize the assembly of the screen on this particular unit). Also, the camera lens and the xenon flash are not centered (it appears that the finish Aluminum plate that is glued on top of the camera, flash and speakers area was not placed with care). Here again noted a visible miss-alignments on both end caps in relation to the main cover body. I still have this unit on hand but probably will return it.The Third unit (which I felt so lucky I got it for $429.00 on Cyber Monday eve) was again another big disappointment. This one appears to be the worst one so far. The front camera appears to be missing its end cover which I can see on the other unit I still have at home. Here again noted a visible miss-alignments on both end caps in relation to the main cover body with the top one significantly off-set showing a visible gap where the earpiece is located. The main camera has failed to close the lens twice while exiting from the camera main screen.As you can see most of the issues I have mentioned here are related to the manufacturing process of this device. As you might know already Nokia itself has admitted that the most talked issue that this phone is experiencing (the power down of the device without any previous action) is been tracked down to the manufacturing lines. So if so far this what we can see on the outside of the phone, What about the internal assembly of this device? How reliable these units can be? Again, this is considered a high end device designed to compete with the high ranked smart phones currently leading the market.As far as the reported performance of the new OS, all three phones have shown sudden slowdowns, sluggishness and a lot of inconsistencies. Maybe clocking up an all processor instead of using a new one was not the best choice made.To conclude I will say that the Nokia N8 is a marvelous device, in paper, worth the $549.00 retail price. The Nokia N8 coming out of the production lines is worth much, much, much less or maybe no worth at all for now. You might still buy this phone but just be aware what you are getting into.","December 1, 2010",0
mobile phone,Had to love it or return it. I 'm going to return it.,Amazon Customer,R2DJPCSEQH0CGK,3,"I am your average un-techie type user. When I buy something I like it to work without a lot of fuss. I am pretty familar with Nokia and Symbian. I've owned various older Nokia bar style phones, and most recently, an e61i(first smartish phone for me) then a MusicXpress 5530.I'll start with the things I liked:The look and feel of the phone: I think it looks great. It is on the heavy side and I like a heavier device. It feels very solid and the weight in my pocket reassures me of its presence with me. If I don't feel its weight, I know I need to stop and find my phone!The camera: Wonderful camera, best camera I've had on a phone. In fact, one of the reasons I bought the phone in the first place.Very good call quality and email. I prefer a qwerty keyboard for texting and the touch screen keyboard worked very well.Ok music player, lots of memory, removeable memory and all the hardware mentioned in other reviews tempted me into buying this phone.Now on to why I'm returning the phone.This phone had trouble connecting to it's own app store(Ovi) I would get ""unable to connect to service"" messages repeatedly from the Ovi store even though my service provider's internet was working fine.I wanted to read a book(Kindle or Mobi Pocket) without converting anything. I wanted to listen to audio books(Audible). I wanted to stream Netflix and Pandora media on my phone. For $450.00+ dollars I had hoped I could be entertained on my N8, I was disappointed. When the phone did connect to the Ovi store, these applicatons are currently nowhere to be found. This hardware is crippled by lack of popular applications! I keep reading that they are adding more and more applications to the Ovi store each day, but not the apps I want to use.I feel like I paid a premium price for barely a step up from my last Nokia(MusicXpress 5530).","December 15, 2010",0

mobile phone,N8 versus N82,"ronny111 ""ron""",RKD3EXERWEF3Q,3,"I own N82 - phone I purchased at Amazon as well and have been very happy with. I purchased N8 before Thanksgiving at $429 to be able to access T-Mobile 3G and get better GPS and camera, as well as larger screen and touch interface.I like N8, but I wish I waited with the switch until the firmware upgrade is available.The phone has some issues that are mostly software, not hardware related based on my exchanges with Nokia and reading various forum postings.The most annoying one is this phone's refusal to stop searching for WiFi when requested manually. I've never seen it in any phone I have owned.The second is apparent incompatibility of some of the voice guidance files with the maps. My UK voice guidance works fine, but not US with street names, which is silent. Standard Nokia Tech advice - do hard reset. I wonder why Nokia even bothers employing Tech Support people. After dealing with them for 20 years I find them pretty much useless.The biggest problem that is not software related (I think - Nokia helpers have no clue - do a hard reset they say ?!) is very poor flash performance. My N82 has N8 beaten hands down. At 10ft distance my N82 photo is nice and sharp; the N8 photo is grainy. This despite of supposedly bigger N8 sensor and 12 MP versus 5MP.The HD video though works great, except for low light conditions again, and flash will not work with video.Overall I am sufficiently happy with the purchase to keep it. I'll use my N82 as a backup with other SIM cards when travelling. Again, I wish I waited till they resolve various bugs. I always liked Nokia and it is so dissappointing to see that they cannot get their act together. In Nokia Support forums Nokia reps are missing. This would have been great opportunity for the company to address some of the above mentioned issues. The fact that they are silent speaks volumes to their customer service committment.","December 16, 2010",0

mobile phone,Nokia N8,Joe Mama,R3BA9Y2MKTXONO,3,"I had been on the fence to purchase the last of Nokia's flagship Symbian powered phones for a long time...but finally made the plunge. Coming from a long line of Nokia products, I was fully prepared for some of the typical Nokia glitches/characteristics. The N8 has a phenomenal camera, which I used extensively. However, after sampling an Android OS smartphone, I felt a bit cheated (read: jealous) that such as powerful, high quality device like the N8 didn't have certain applications or support from its software developers. Nokia's OVI store has come a long way from my previous E50 and E71, but at the end of the day, I felt like something was missing. Most touch screen phones are usually easy to operate, but this one required far more (and almost unnecessary) key strokes and steps to accomplish every task, that it became exhausting to do anything. Previous Symbian powered devices run circles around it with their old school hardware keys. I did not experience any of the shut downs or problems may others did. Conversely, this had so many great Nokia features and hardware I hated to return it because I'm such a Nokia fan...but with the recent withdrawal of Nokia from the US market I felt abandoned as a long term customer.Likes: excellent camera, alarm clock that works even if you power the phone off, built in OVI maps (not reliant upon the buggy network carrier), battery life, screen resolution and build quality.Dislikes: cost, lack of popular applications available for download, buggy processor at times, and extremely difficult data input method.If the E7 would have the N8's camera, or the N8 the E7's keyboard I suspect it would've been easier to live with.","September 15, 2011",0
mobile phone,just short of expectation,Dan Lee,R19CH3X0L3QWO0,3,"Now this is a difficult review in that the phone has serious strengths and weaknesses. In order for a phone to be a first class communication device, it must be joined by both performance, reliability, but most importantly usability. I believe that this phone would be an outstanding smart phone anywhere around the world, minus the U.S. I believe that Apple, Google, and even Windows Phone 7 has way surpassed Nokia Symbian^3 in UI. That being said I'd like to offer up my viewpoints of the N8 having come from Iphone 4.PROs1. Hardware built quality, reliability, reception performance, call quality, speaker phone, noise cancellation, battery life are all something that comes to mind immediately2. Overall build quality is exceptional, unlike Samsung, LGs of the world, this phone is built to last. Even HTC does not measure up in terms of quality build.3. AMOLED screen is nice and bright, color contrast is pretty good, minus the resolution4. Reception and call quality is great, coming from the Iphone4, the N8 is a God send. I no longer have dropped calls, callers can hear me, and I can actually use the speaker phone function and have no issues with callers not being able to hear me. The Iphone had a major problem in this area in that it can't reliabily connect to a bluetooth headset, or use the speaker phone without your voice breaking up or the callers. Bluetooth connected on the N8 without incident.5. Noise cancellation is an area that I think Nokia has perfected, I get better noise cancellation with Nokia period than any other I've tried, ie iphone4, HTC, LG or Samsung.6. battery life for a smart phone is surprising good. Unlike my iphone 4 or HTC having to charge constantly7. if you are a world traveller, you will appreciate the Nokia maps. It allows you to travel the world and have navigation map capabilities withou wifi. I mean anywhere Nokia has a map for that country. It is also nice that domestically when you travel to an area without wifi or cell signal, I can still find my way around with Nokia maps, unlike google maps or Microsoft bing maps will stop functioning or provide directions.CONs1. Small screen @ 3.5 inch. spec wise the same as Iphone4, but in reality smaller.2. Low, inadequate resolution @640x360, in today's market, it's a joke.3. The UI on Symbian^3 is just not right for the US market. We live in a society where we are only concerned about having, and not about conserving. Nokia really lost out in this market. I can understand why Nokia is strong elsewhere, but have absolutely been drowned out here in the US. I'm not so sure that Windows Phone 7 or 8 can change that because they will now also be restricted by the same software heavy, resource intensive burden everyone else has to deal with, and that is more cpu power=lower battery life.4. web browser is not the greatest, it is spotty and doesn't allow for decent browsing, even with Opera, it's still why behind the web experience of an Iphone45. A serious lack of main stream application support by US companies, I can't even get Pandora, or speedtest for symbian. Of course Google maps is only half functioning on Symbian^3. So don't expect a great many useful apps for Symbian^3. Nokia has completely lost sight at the wheel on this.6. Processor speed at 680Mhz ARM 11 is simply not speedy. It gets the job done, but come on... a faster processor would help a lot.7. Nokia has tray away from their core and has made a phone that just takes too many step just to make a call. they took out the hard call button that worked real well. A number shows up on screen, click call, that's it. Now instead, you have to push one button to retrieve one number than click on the number then you can call. That also holds true with many other parts of the Nokia Symbian^3 os. boy, they definitely need help there.I'm sorry but the reason we have such crap products these days is that all companies are trying to do is compete on price point. They keep scaling back on everything to meet a price point instead of just doing it right by building the right phone. While I understand economics, but companies have become way too profit driven on the other end. We need to promote and demand more consumer centric innovation, and not profit focus.Now having said all of the above, I think the N8 is still a great communicator, from a phone standpoint. I'm torn between having a phone that is well built + a nice 7"" tablet or 10"" if permits; or have one massive crammed smartphone at 4.5in. I loved everything about the iphone4 except the simple inability of Apple to provide reliable bluetooth headset connectivity; or something as simple as being able to use the speaker phone that actually works in real life, usable is all I ask. How tough is that. I hope Steve Jobs will not try and rush a product for profit, and ruin a loyal following over the years based on merits of his products. All the other phones out there are all trying to throw as many buzz technology to lure customers, but non will last very long, or perform like a Nokia phone. So I'm one frustrated user where I'd like many aspects of a Nokia in its reliability and performance of a phone, but not so good with web and apps.Hope all this would help someone else making a decision","May 31, 2011",0
mobile phone,things to consider,Pavel Kuksa,R2441K2OUQK7P7,3,"Below is a list of things to know about N8(note that this is mostly about things that 'directly' affect user experience, in no particular order)1. Playing music off of an external flash drive/hard drive is problematic (can only select one song at a time). Do let me know if you know how to play folders from external devices.2. The phone freezes at times (did it with music player, web browser, etc), symbian^3 feels not very stable. I used N82 for 2+years (and 7610 for 4yrs before that), both were very stable (I do not remember if it froze even once).3. The phone sometimes would not turn back on for an extended period of time while connected to power (one time it took over 24 hours) after it turns itself off with low battery.4. When you talk, 'hold' or 'end call' buttons get clicked with my ear quite often, so you get disconnected. Not sure how to solve this except for not forgetting to use this 'lock' slider on a side of the phone.5. The 'settings / connectivity / wifi' sometimes just freezes and does not let to choose wifi network.6. The 'mail' application is hard to use and set up, there are obvious / well known bugs in the software, e.g. it will randomly not display option for custom / other mail setup (IMAP, etc) or any other predefined profiles (like gmail). I consider I got lucky 'custom' option eventually showed up after multiple resets and I was able to setup an account.7. 'Ovi store' periodically would not connect (with general 'connection error') which can be annoying.8. Automatic screen rotation is very shaky, takes too long to recognize rotation, e.g. from portrait to landscape, or just switches back to portrait mode while you are typing in landscape (it may be quite annoying at times as it just takes away your time).9. Keyboard in portrait mode is alphanumeric, so you can't type fast while in portrait mode. qwerty keyboard is only available in the landscape mode (this potentially can be fixed with some 3rd party keyboard applications).10. Default web browser is very user unfriendly. It takes some patience and a good amount of clicks before you finish typing an address into 'address bar'.After you press 'web' icon, (0) you see two bars, one 'address', the other 'search', you then (1) 'double tap' on the address bar (it takes some practice, the address bar requires 'precision' tapping), (2) the 'alphanumeric'! keyboard comes up so that you can punch in the web address, notice that there is no url history to help you here so you have to retype the entire address, (3) you have to click on that big green checkmark to confirm you input, (4) this brings to the same screen as in step (0)!, so (5) you click on 'go' button on the far right of the address bar, (6) the website starts loading.I have never seen anything quite like this before.Notice that if you prefer landscape QWERTY keyboard, you may need one more step in between (2) and (3) which is to 'rotate' your phone to bring up the QWERTY keyboard.Installing 'opera' browser can address these issues. Opera has its own *portrait* mode QWERTY keyboard, it's much better.11. 12mp camera is just fine, it takes practice to take pictures as it seems to be more sensitive to 'shaking' while taking pictures than 5mp on N82 (I have already gotten a good amount of blurry pictures on this 12mp camera).12. FM transmitter is relatively weak, needs to be right next to the radio, even then can be noisy (I used it in my car).Hope some of this may help! just wanted to share.","January 6, 2011",0
mobile phone,"UI sucks, not Unicode Font support, not really a ""WORLD PHONE""",Mike Woods,R153PJQCEXPG4G,3,"I totally agree with other reviews about all good things of N8, such as fast boot, great camera, good signal,...I will not repeat here.I have two main problems with N8:1. UI not friendlyYes it's fancy, but all those simply functions should be kept as simple as possible. for example, I want to save a number from incoming call list, when I touch that number, it dials the number automatically. I know I can figure it out after searching/reading something (BTW, no paper manual with the package, you either use ""user guide"" on the phone, or googl search; using ""user guide"" is painfull too), but why should I spend time on making these basic features work? Hi man, is it a SMART phone to test how smart you are??2. the biggest problem for me: no multiple language supportI bought it at AMAZON, US version. If you speak English only, please forgive me, it's not a problem for you. you can ignore here now. But if you plan to use N8 to read SMS or browse webpage or input something in other languages, such as Hebrew, Chinese, Korean, Thai, Japanese, Spanish, French... Read this""Nokia has decided that each phone sold to each region (Europe, China, North America, Middle East Africa, India, Thailand) would have separate language packs. If you live in North America, you probably get Latin Fonts without support for CJK (Chinese, Japanese, Korean), Arabic, Hindi, Hebrew.... etc. and the Keyboard is limited to English, French, Spanish, maybe Italian...""After searching google several hours, I found a not perfect way to hack N8 and change language package. But again, why should I do this with a risk to break the warranty?? I am an end user, not a developer. When my iphone/Android phones are able to browse web pages, read text messages in these languages..., where is Nokia?? Maybe Nokia doesn't need to compete with iphone/Android phone.""Connecting the World""?? Come on, I can't!!! In the end, I return the phone.","December 5, 2010",0

mobile phone,Not what I expected of Nokia,Jimmy Stewart,R3QWZOSTD47VZ2,3,"I have owned and used this phone for 5 months. I was debating between 2 and 3 stars on this review.The pros: Good looks, sturdy design, responsive keyboard, Symbian OS may be outdated but saves on battery (if I don't use it heavily the battery lasts 3-4 days, which is impossible with iPhones), the GPS system has free map updates and works in remote areas, uses regular SIM card, not micro, there is a micro SD slot and the total memory of 16GB is upgradable to a whole 48 GB - rarely you have a phone with such a great storage capacity; the camera is very good with 12 megapixels and Carl Zeiss optics. It remains the phone with the best camera on the market. The Bluetooth works well.The cons: #1 shortcoming - the screen goes black and locks when you have to pick up a call, or when you initiate one. After all this is a PHONE, Nokia. It is hard to be unlocking the phone every time a call comes in. The same for an alarm. When it wakes you up, you can't just punch the ""snooze"" button, you have to unlock the phone's black screen by pushing down the side slide unlock button. BTW this problem affects a tremendous amount of N8's accross the world but Nokia seems to offer no solution or even recognition of the problem. 2. The phone does lock sometimes; 3. the ""Play via radio"" FM transmitter appears not to work. Although I've tried it on various FM receivers it simply does not connect, although the phone screen says it is transmitting. People point out lack of half a million aps for Symbian OS but I use only 3-4 of those, and I have found those I need. So this is not really a shortcoming.Conclusion: N8 is a smart phone with many qualities however the unresponsive screen, and the other glitches makes it a sort of a dud. I am too conservative and do not like the harsh way the tech industry is pushing people to become insane consumers of ever ""improving"" new technology. I usually look for a phone that will last at lest 3 or more years, so I was hoping the Nokia N8 would cut it. It did not. I am a long time Nokia user and have been impressed with their simplicity, durability, competitive prices and versatility. Not this time around, sorry. I may be moving to another brand.","December 15, 2012",0
mobile phone,Was fantastic at first,Chrystal,R1UXO6V43TFL08,3,"I purchased this phone almost two years ago and while I absolutely enjoyed it at first I can't wait to get rid of it now. It is buggy as hell and has been from a few months in. Now just opening my contact list can cause my phone to freeze and/ or doing just about anything else. Almost from the beginning I would get memory full messages even though I only have the apps that came with the phone ( I have a few hundred pictures stored but they are all on my 16gb memory card). My text messages stopped going out at one point and I would just get an error message. It resolved itself after about three weeks and I have never been able to figure out what was the cause.My camera stopped working for months. I would press the camera shutter or open the app and it would instantly crash. I tried every solution that I could find online to no avail. Finally I downloaded a panoramic camera app and this solved whatever the problem was. Calls drop all the time or the screen malfunctions and I can't end a call.There just seems to always be an issue with the phone and i'm tired watching my friends use their phones with such ease so im buying a new phone (hopefully a nexus 4). Below are some of my favorite pros of the N8:1) Build quality: This phone is an absolute dream to look at. It is thick, especially when compared with other phones but it is solid and has a nice weight to it. To be honest this phone has taken some serious falls lately like a tumble down stone steps hitting each one on the way down and a flying leap from my hands at ear level onto a tar pavement with only a few dents and scratches to show for it. Nothing beats the original Gorilla Glass!2) Camera: While I have since had issues with picture quality (possibly due to said falls somehow) this camera took the best pictures that I have seen on any phone to date. My friend's Iphone 4s had nothing on it! I bought a panasonic digital camera at the same time and ended up gifting it to my cousins, this baby got the job done much better :)3) Screensaver: I love being able to pick up or look over at my phone and see what time it is without touching anything. It sounds so simple but you would be suprised how convenient it is and I don't recall any other phone with this capability.4) Built in FM radio: I live in The Bahamas and I can tell you that during a power outage or storm that radio 'apps' won't cut it if there's no cell service. It is invaluable (although why i don't have a battery powered radio in my house under these circumstances would probably be a very good question).5) Battery life: I can consistently get at least a day's worth out of this phone. Even if this includes taking pictures (alot), making calls, messaging on what's app all day, listening to music or the radio and a little reading my pdf files.All in all it was good while it lasted but this phone is unable to keep up the times. A phone that will let you done with basic texting and calling capailties becomes just an expensive paperweight no matter how you look at it. If I could take the features that I love and put them into my next phone I would be the happiest person alive.","December 14, 2012",0
mobile phone,cool design...but functionality is not that good,Dhupkhola,R1DD5X92E2KQIK,3,"Used this phone for about 20 days & to be honest, I was looking for an excuse to keep it...But i returned it at last...Pros: Great design, Cool camera for daylight, Sound quality is good.Cons: Applications run slow, shut down in the middle of the function, WiFi is horrible, it cuts itself off from the internet, could not use an uninterrupted internet using WiFi. Night photograph quality is not good. Could not run two applications at the same time without getting stuck.There are some other features i did not like but that is my personal opinion. Anybody may like those.I am not sure that whether the one that i used had these problems or all of the Nokia N8 phones have the same problems.

mobile phone,Device is a hear breaker,"Sawan Mahindrakar ""saavz""",REISHDCWOAUGI,3,"This wont be a lengthy review since i had the phone for a day before i returned it, to be honest i returned in a hurry because i knew if i kept it for long enough i would have ended up keeping it. The construction is just beautiful, the look and feel of the hardware is superb, cant say much about battery life since i didn't use it extensively, but i have used the E71 in the past and i reckon it should be pretty good (compared to my Evo 4G!!). Coming to the heart break part, the OS and the touch response of the phone is just not up to par for modern standards, IOS and Android are miles ahead, truth be told I use my phone more for the apps than for any other thing, even calling :) for which i use Skype.These days the UI has to be fluid and well thought out with a mix of widgets icons etc, IMHO it has to aggregate the huge amount of information phone users consume these days and present it in the most concise and speedy way possible, and Symbiam^3 achieves none of those. Lack of apps, the UI is dated, the browser is really awful the notion of using ovi integration for emails and other services is a total non starter and the list goes on. Hope WinNokia can get it right.","March 19, 2011",0

mobile phone,"Great hardware, UI Lacking | ""If you have a Nokia fetish, buy this. ..user friendly smartphone that's intuitive, keep looking..""",Christopher J. Foxley,RC2Y10TR71YU0,3,"The Nokia N8 boasts robust technology. Full connectivity with WIFI, GPS, Bluetooth, FM Radio, and even an FM transmitter. It also has a fantastic and fun 12 megapixel camera that is easy to use as a standalone capture device, and also has an HDMI output and connectors for hi definition transmission.The screen looks great, case is metallic, durable, and overall weight of the device in hand feels great and the slim sleek lines add to its appeal. It also features a lower resolution front video cam for video calling (that I'm hearing isn't available on North American networks). And alongside the iOS and Android mainstream competitors, features an ambient light sensor and accelerometer, with features and apps that utilize this tech to the fullest.Call quality is excellent and along with sound playback, is crystal clear and better than any smartphone I've been on to date.Where does it lack?Hardware: The processor is a tad sluggish. If you're hoping to do some gaming on this device, I'd skip to another model.Software and Store: Everything is menu driven. So if you're used to using the home button (iOS) to go back and choose options, or the back/ return key for the same (Android), then this think will feel like using Linux on a Mac; quant, but redundant.The store? Lacks the diversity of iTunes and the Google Play store by far, and so is limited in the array of applications available to it. Also, the sync is nowhere near as intuitive as the Android system, or the iOS for that matter.Overall:Good | Great call quality and a great component system. Works on any non CDMA network. Devoted Nokia followers will probably find the navigation improved to previous models and be ok with the store selection.Bad | The operating system and processor just doesn't compete with others in its class. As a smartphone, unless you're only using Ovi Suite (available exclusively to PC), you're going to be left out in the cold when it comes to syncing all of your information seamlessly.Bottom Line | If you have a Nokia fetish, buy this. If you're shopping around for a user friendly smartphone that's intuitive, keep looking for an Android.","July 12, 2013",0
mobile phone,Great hardware let down by dated software,Philip Skeete,RF1O17FH2I7U,3,"I have always been a huge Nokia fan but bailed in favor of android devices a while back. I couldn't resist giving the N8 a shot to see what advances Symbian 3 had made. All I can say is it hasn't come very far. When you are used to the blinding speed of advancement in the android space its hard to imagine how Nokia are going to stay relevant.This is amazing piece of hardware, but how frustrating it is to be back on symbian. I dont even know where to start suffice to say that I am back on android after only a few days with N8. I was very disappointed as I had high hopes.N8 Pro:Excellent battery lifeBest camera of any phoneFinally has threaded texting (as long as it took isnt a good sign for Nokia)N8 cons:Not many prosKeyboard sucksBrowser sucksExchange client sucksStill cant type direct in a text boxLimited widgetsLimited appsSluggish UINo wifi tetherSmallish screen for size of deviceAmoled screen isnt even close to vibrantIf maemo and symbian 3 are the best Nokia can offer I would think they would be best off to leave symbian 3 on their feature phones and adopt android for smartphones. Android is a tidal wave they just arent going to be able to stand in front of. Unless you are a huge symbian fan or have apps that only run on symbian then give this one a miss.","January 19, 2011",0
mobile phone,"Beautiful phone, terrible product quality control from Nokia",Peter,RF2L7HVGFDYEG,3,"Amazon delivered this phone in a timely manner. I was excited when I opened the box, immediately turned on the phone and start playing with it. Surprisingly the phone was already half charged. A few minutes into it however I realized the screen acted weird. There were ""line"" across the screen, and are very obvious. At first I thought it was intentional, but then realized that the screen is defective. I googled ""nokia defective screen"" and sure enough there were tons of hits. Turns out that the defective screen is a widespread problem among Nokia's N8 and C7 phone, especially ones made after the initial release (October 2010?). I also noticed the battery got VERY hot after charging the phone for about 20 minutes. I didn't want to give up, and called one of the Nokia Care center (a designated cell phone shop) listed on Nokia's website, hoping that they'd be able to replace mine with a new phone immediately, since it's still under full warranty. The representative said they're new to the Nokia Care and don't even have any parts available. They could fix my phone free of charge (under warranty) but it'd take them weeks since they have to apply for parts from Nokia, wait for shipment, then fix the phone. Or, they said I could pay $200 and they'd order screens from their own vendor here in the U.S. They also said the battery is defective since it heats up so quickly, and that I'd also have to pay extra if I don't want to wait for them to ""apply"" to Nokia. Like I'm going to pay $200 on top of the $400 I just paid for my brand new phone? Needless to say, I returned the phone to Amazon immediately, and thankfully they refunded my account in full.It's too bad, this is really a good phone. I've done extensive research on smart phones, and I thought N8 would best suit my needs and life style. I don't do social network, or want to pay for expensive data plans. I just want a good quality phone with strong reception and loud speaker, that has a very good camera (I don't have a digital camera), with many connection options (USB on the go, bluetooth for file transferring, etc), and can also act as a PDA (calendar, contacts, notes, all sync with Google). Basically I want the swiss army knife version of a smart phone without the bloat data plan. And N8 would've been it. Unfortunately Nokia has completely dropped the ball on quality control. This incident also made me realize that Nokia has NO PRESENCE whatsoever in the U.S. Apparently they don't care about this market, and that if something happen to the product I purchased from them, I'd have nowhere to turn to except their mediocre ""care center"", which can't even function properly because of all the bureaucracy. I heard Nokia is taking a different turn with Windows Phone 7, where they'll focus more on the North American market. I hope they do. I've always liked Nokia phone because of the excellent reception and hardware built; I even like Symbian for what it's worth. But I'm not going to put my hard-earned money to buy a piece of technology then get little to no support when it breaks (within warranty). Buyers beware.","August 16, 2011",0

Also the same GLITCHES I had on my N80 are on the N8. I used my N80 for about 7 months before it stopped working complitely so I really hope the N8 will last longer. NOT MANY USEFULL APLICATIONS at all. Because my wife doesnt understand much in phones she didnt want to return it because she thinks its a nice looking phone (and it really is a good looking for) but I really wanted to return it.

mobile phone,Nokia abondoning the Symbian. Do not expect significant OS updates in future,techsavy,RN5GPPGK8W1JA,3,"I would like to warn the potential buyers that Nokia decided to kill the Symbian and go with Windows phone 7 OS. So we may not see any significant updates to this phone in future as initially promised by Nokia. So think before buying any Symbian device.I mainly bought this phone because of :1. Excellent camera2. Excellent build quality3. Free stand alone GPS receiver and excellent ovi maps (No data plan or internet required to use maps)4. Excellent functionality of the Symbian (I am not a fan of flashy UI)5. Not carrier branded (i.e. not loaded with carrier bloat ware as well as not crippled by carriers. I just need wifi and do not need 3G. I am using this phone with AT&T; without data plan.)It is very sad that Nokia decided to go with WP7. This means that we will not have any mobile OS that is not restricted by carriers.Price on this phone was reduced by 30 bucks after the Nokia's announcement. I think the price will drop further.

mobile phone,Nokia N8,Amazon Customer,R34CXANTD7ZFTT,3,"I got the phone directly from Amazon while I still had my Blackberry 9700. I wanted to handle a touch phone.Pros:- big screen- good video capabilities plays a lot of formats- good sound.- HDMI port can come in handy sometimes.Cons:- 12 MPx Camera? I got crappy pics out of it. My VGA webcam takes better pics. Either that or there was something wrong with the Amazon stock. I've read good reviews about the camera on this one but I got really bad pics. the pics were hazy like the light balance was not right.- Here is the thing with touch screens. They have to work perfectly or else it is just bad mood for the user. The buttons on a keypad for some reason gets more patience out of users. I felt the OS of the phone is a little quirky. Not really up to competition. Not smooth at all.The phone has a lot of features, promise. But it doesnt deliver them in the end.My cheaper blackberry was more reliable than it so I went back to it.All other things apart... watch out for the camera people. you buy a 12 MP camera phone and if you can't get the pictures, its just not worth it, you would rather have a better user experience.","August 2, 2011",0
mobile phone,So close but yet so far,Christopher Morris,RSZ1KH029NCVK,3,"I ordered this direct from Nokia and have been using it on AT&T; for about a week.I wanted to like this phone so badly. It looks like it was designed by brilliant engineers, only to be taken away and ruined at the last minute by a horde of clueless pencil-pushers. It's like you can see Nokia's legendary infighting in action.This would be an amazing $350 phone. The form factor and build quality must be seen to be believed, and it does the basics very well (HDMI/composite out is a really cool feature but useless for me). But for the same price as the latest Android/iPhone? No way.The camera, while excellent has a huge Achilles heel: no lens cover, and no included lens cloth. What good is a Zeiss Tessar lens when it's covered with fingerprints and pocket fuzz (and just you wait until it gets scratched!)? Also, you can't silence the shutter tone (great for weddings!). The touchscreen can be buggy after unlocking via the slider - half the time you can't swipe from one home screen to the next, or it goes out of order. Oh, and the keyboard really is as bad as the reviews say.The default GMail app can't archive. No touch events/HTML5 for the Web browser, which is a moot point because even moderately intensive sites like Sladshdot slow the phone to an unbearable crawl. No multitouch at all besides pinch/zoom in the browser and photo viewer. I described my feelings on the phone to my girlfriend, a teacher, who compared it to a C student who gets A+'s on his exams but never does his homework. That's fairly apt, I think.I went by Best Buy and bought a Galaxy S. The difference is night and day. I'm calling Nokia for an RMA tomorrow.edit: I see now that Ovi Maps, the browser, and others are due for updates - but IMHO having to move to beta-quality software immediately upon release to get a $550 smartphone experience is not acceptable.","October 17, 2010",0

Unfortunately, the phone's battery life left much to be desired and I found the user interface completely unintuitive. I didn't enjoy using the device.","June 13, 2012",0
mobile phone,"Just stick to your Querty Keys, People",Tarzan,R3MAI4CEBJHSRQ,3,"The Nokia C6-01 was my first full touch screen phone and it didn't last long (3 months to be exact). The touch screen first got distorted then it went completely blank in 2 days.I had actually purchased that C6 to replace my old Nokia E71; but when the C6 failed I ended up going back to ole faithful (and the ole guy is still running without a glitch).If it's Nokia you are looking for, then I personally recommend that you try to find something like the E 71. But be sure to check the Amazon reviews carefully before you make your purchase.I hear that the existing successors to the E71 (E72 & E73) are not better than the E 71.I don't think there is anything that has come close to the E71 yet. And I have been using Nokia for years now.In fact it would be perfect if we could get the E71 phone's firmware upgraded to the C6 level; because the C6 has newer features such as improved voice recognition that allows you to specify whether you want to dial the contact's mobile, home, or business number etc. While the E71 only allows you to dial the first number that appears in the contact's list.The E71 battery life far exceeds the C6; probably because it doesn't have to waste energy on a touch-screen!I am now going to have to return my new C6 to get it repaired or replaced under warrantee. And then I will have to try to sell it to someone at a loss.And will continue to use my little ole faithful E71 until Nokia reads this comment and decides to give me an updated version; or at least a long overdue firmware upgrade.","March 21, 2012",0
mobile phone,1 YEAR REVIEW,Bob,R1TTKN0YCWV1J7,3,"My girlfriend got this phone and it is one of the best phones I have ever used. I play with it all of the time and I have to say that it is really user friendly. This is also a great phone because it is unlocked, which means I get to save money on our phone bill because we do not have to pay internet data charges. The internet browsing experience is way better compared to previous Symbian browsers (this is using a wifi connection). Also, the operating system's usability, in my opinion, has been upgraded. Finally, the camera is really amazing on this phone. It will take quick pictures with clarity.The only con about this phone is that sometimes the user can get ahead of the phone and it will quit an application or be a little slow BUT this does not happen often and I still want to buy this phone knowing this small flaw.Overall I give this phone 8/10.UPDATE!I ORIGINALLY RATED THIS ITEM 5 STARS BUT AFTER ALMOST HAVING THIS PHONE FOR A YEAR THIS PHONE BECAME VERY SLOW! THE DID NOT REALLY SPEED THE PHONE UP TOO MUCH!The phone is still decent but only deserves 3 stars.DON'T PURCHASE THIS PHONE - GO WITH A PHONE THAT HAS MORE SUPPORT!

mobile phone,Cannot delete apps,Karsten Decker,RJGUS30ROG8GD,3,"The phone came without the 2gm MicroSD card. The Nokia USB cable did not work to connect to Nokia Suite completely ( It recognized the phone, but was unable to update, however, it worked with another cable I had already). The phone made the impression as if it was returned by a customer before, cleaned and repackaged. It was not in original retail package but kind of a gift box. The wrist band was missing as well. The seller was willing to take it back and refund price and shipping, however, I had it forwarded to Bermuda and paid customs and shipping for that.I just wish the seller would have said its kind of refurbished or otherwise opened before.I bought this phone to use the GPS without having to use Data plan (especially when abroad). For that it is great like other Nokia GPS phones. Other than that I want to use it as a phone and for some sms messages, maybe take a picture at times. So just for things you don't need data for. I don't want email etc. Its nice it has wifi, so at home I can download maps without connecting toteh internet. Howeve,r the voice guidance can only be downloaded via nokia suite on a computer. I don't have a data plan, I don't want one. However, the phone is full of apps you cannot get rid of. I don't want Microsoft office for a phone (requires paid registration), Typing is hard enough on the touch screen. WHo would create a doc on a phone? I don't want the weather forecast or public transport etc. At least I was able to create a folder (I called it trash) where I could move unwanted icons, because otherwise they crowd your screen. Unfortunately you don't find instructions how to get rid of any of those (only some can be deleted, the rest eats phone memory). As you may notice I am not a smart phone fan, so that makes me bias. I have no use for fancy apps, just the opposite, they make life harder for me.Pros: GPS, wifi, bluetooth, unlocked, good phone calling quality, well build, 8megapixel, flash built in, can be used as a flash light in the dark. Skype can be installed to make free or cheap calls via wifi. Charges via usb (my old Nokia did not) and also has a charger input for the typical Nokia chargers (small connector) from before. It came with usb charger and car charger for usb. Since I still have my old chargers I have two sets now. USB chargers work on other phones like blackberry or samsung as well.Cons: too many useless apps, cannot sync with my mozilla calendar (insists on Outlook), it seems Microsoft used its new influence on Nokia to lock people into their software. App store not very organized. The keys on the qwerty soft key pat on the screen are relatively small (even in landscape) and the fingertips often hit more than one key or the wrong one. The touch pat works with heat sensitivity, not like in the 5230, which I had before, with actual pressure. So the phone comes without a pic or stylus to be more accurate. Maybe I just have to get used to it a little more. Many apps cannot be deleted even if you don't plan to use them ever.Too bad I lost my old Nokia 5230 Navi edition. Good thing, the C6 fits in my old cradle for the car holder.I am still happy because I use GPS only in when visiting the United States or Europe and the free maps are great for that.","September 26, 2013",0

mobile phone,A bit slow,elham pirmoradian,R1FJ6OXMBA3T1R,3,"Even though I am a big fan of Nokia, I must say it turned me down this time.

mobile phone,I love Nokia but why are they make it so unfriendly to international travelers?,Brian Pressman,R242KGH2ZVNU72,3,"I've been a loyal Nokia user for years. I got this phone as a replacement because my last candy bar nokia died from exposure to moisture. The phone is great. Nice display, compact, and solid feeling. My one, large complaint? Nokia makes no effort to help those of us who speak a foreign language and require multiple languages in our phones. In an age where multi language support is as easy as selecting something from a drop down menu (Windows, Apple iphone, etc), Nokia won't even make additional language packs available. I just can't understand this. If a guy on a street corner can do it, why can't the company offer this service? Maybe this is one of the reasons Nokia continues to lose market share?","August 24, 2011",0

mobile phone,Proprietary Data/Charging Cable is Annoying,Ontime 2,R2N29BYJUET99E,3,"It is really annoying and you should be aware that the CORRECT data/charging cable to use is different than generic micro USB. Most people are unaware it is supposed to use a genuine HTC DC-T500 extMicro USB cable for proper fitment and to prevent damage to the data/charging port. From personal experience on this subject, (having bought a brand new Incredible in a sealed Verizon branded box that contained a generic micro USB cable) I can tell you that a standard generic micro USB will fit (sort of) and will probably charge, but even according to HTC, will over time will make the socket loose causing the cable to keep falling out or may damage the port. Depending on where and how you buy, the DC-T500 cable may or may not be included. I find it ""incredible"" (in a bad way) that HTC decided to do this on this phone and some others such as the Amaze 4G (which I bought used and has the same issue) and Jetstream tablet devices. It is very strange as this cable only fits a few of their products and does not fit standard micro USB ports. The good news is that the DC-T500 cable fits tightly and perfectly, is (as of this writing) available for purchase, in white or black, here at Amazon (search: DC-T500). You should do research for information about this issue, ask questions about the cable before ordering an Incredible, and decide for yourself if it's worth bothering with. If you can get past this issue, it's an affordable decent 3G phone overall. It's just not amazing, sensational, astonishing (?) nor is it, well, incredible.","October 11, 2013",0

mobile phone,Nice phone...when it works,Matt F.,R32QMI00CZL79,3,"I have had the Droid Incredible for a little over a year at the time of this review. I believe that I have a good ""feel"" for this phone now that I've used it for a while, and my summary is that I don't think it deserves the title ""Incredible"". To clarify my review, I am reviewing both the phone and the operating system (Android 2.3.4 on my device). I think reviewing the operating system is applicable because HTC has its own custom flavor of Android installed (HTC Sense) and that plays a part in how the phone functions (or not). I'm also using it on a prepaid carrier. Here's my breakdown:The good:1. It's a smartphone that runs Android which has a lot of free apps versus the competition.2. Voice quality is good, I've never had a problem with this. It's a phone after all!3. It records HD video.4. This is a smaller Android phone than others so it is more portable. It fits in my pocket nicely.5. Standby battery life is good if you turn everything off like data, wi-fi, etc.6. I like using my phone as a navigation device, and this phone has standalone GPS which is great. No need to have a cell signal/data connection if you use offline maps.7. 3.5mm headphone jack.8. Flashlight (I use it more than you think).The bad:1. Freezes WAY too often. This is my main issue with the phone, and I would give it another star if this freeze issue didn't exist. Freezing once in a while and having a reboot solve the problem is one thing. I'm talking about the phone freezing and then having to reboot several times before the phone decides to work again. I'm at the point where I'm afraid of turning the phone off because I will have to reboot several times until it decides to stop freezing. Trust me when I say I have done hours of research on how to fix this, and tried all sorts of tricks, with no success.2. Battery life drains quickly if you have connections like 3G enabled or watch video. My opinion about battery life is that you should be able to leave your data connection on all day and not run out of battery. This is actually rather common with a lot of older Android phones so I can't fault the HTC Incredible too much, I just live with it. My main gripe is that my ""smart"" phone is a dumb phone when I have to keep data and other services turned off most of the time so I can get through the day without recharging. I can't use features like voice search or voice text or push email without having to turn the data connection back on (because I'm conserving battery again). The push email works if you ""manage"" your battery, meaning you have an app turn on your connection every so often.3. Has too little phone memory and application data storage compared to how much storage there is on an SD card. What I mean is that I am using a 32gb SD card, with 25gb of free space left. I still have over 6gb of internal storage because I install all my apps on the SD card. However, I only have 99mb of phone memory left and 33mb of application data storage left. What this means is that I get a ""low space"" notification and can't install new apps or even update some of the larger apps on my phone (which by the way are all on the SD card) without uninstalling something. Again I have done tricks like deleting all my texts, killing apps, clearing the cache etc which frees up space but it still doesn't solve my ""low space"" problem.CONCLUSION: Overall, this is not a bad phone, but the ""deal killer"" for me is that the phone freezes a lot. I can adjust to things like low space or short battery life, but a phone that freezes even in the middle of a phone call is not good. I want to like this phone, and kind of do, but HTC could have done better with a phone named ""Incredible"".","July 31, 2013",0

The new one did not have any issues. This had the potential to be an awesome phone, it has a snapdragon processor that allows it to MOVE, much better than some of the rival phones released around the same time.

mobile phone,Battery hog,Richard H. Cressler,RY9LG0ZZOUCWH,3,"This phone can't go more than two hours even on standby without being on a charging source. Now, to be fair, it IS an older model phone for todays apps and I DO run a good many apps on it. The memory could be better (more) since about once a week the battery needs removed and replaced to unfreeze it, but it does have it's good points.1. It was inexpensive. It's an older model phone with 3G connection rather than the 4G of the newer phones, so the price is a bit less.2. The display is surprisingly clear.3. It's relatively fast in processing the apps installed until it freezes.4. it's not big and clunky, yet not too small to be productive. I got this one for my girlfriend as a replacement for a flip phone and to keep the cost down until the contract allowed for a newer replacement. The smaller screen size allows it to be a little less cumbersome to carry in a pocket or holster than my Razr Maxx, which tends to dig in to my side while driving if it's in the holster, or not fit in a pocket with the Otterbox Defender on it.This thing was good for the reason I purchased it, but had there been a better deal on a newer model phone that has better battery quality, I'd definitely go with the newer generation of phone.","June 22, 2013",0

mobile phone,Well... it's a phone.,Amy E. Nelson,R2E4BY90ZUVJEQ,3,"I had previously owned this kind of phone, lost it, and purchased the same one again on here. It arrived within a decent amount of time, but it came pre-scratched, which upset me a little, since it's supposedly a new phone and I could scratch it on my own. Everything else seemed to work alright though. All in all, this was not my favorite purchase, and I would recommend picking out a more functional phone. This one hates trying to get on the Internet for any reason! Also, it seems to get confused when I try to view my pictures, or really navigate through anything else on my phone, and runs super slow.","July 2, 2012",0
mobile phone,Wouldn't Have Purchased if it Wasn't for the Price,Jay,RQWM4MNBQ5RGC,3,"The phone I bought was sold through BlueTek USA. It looked used. The back cover was dirty, not in plastic, had greasy smudges on it from fingers, and the part above the USB port was broken.Now on to the phone review:The initial boot-up took a few minutes which is ypical of most smartphones, especially old ones with slow processors. Once it booted up, I was prompted to activate the phone with Verizon Wireless. I shut the phone off, went to my account page on Verizon's website, activated the phone, then started over again.After activation, I was prompted to create a Palm account. The first thing I noticed was how cramped and sludgy feeling, yet clicky the keyboard is. The second thing I noticed was how slow this thing is. But I wasn't expecting much from a smartphone with a 600mhz processor. Seriously though, when I tried to change my ringtone, it took 5-10 seconds for the phone to gather and display the ringtones. ""Seconds"" doesn't usually indicate a long time, but compare it to any smartphone released in the past year and it'll seem slow.Once initial setup was completed, a walkthrough began to play which demonstrated how to use the phone's gestures. What looks like dead space/useless bezel between the keyboard and the screen is actually a touch panel for back, forward, and up gestures which feeds back with a soothing, glowing strip of light.Web OS is pretty nice though. I like the way multitasking works and it's fairly simple to use with little learning curve. If you want to search for an installed app, search the web, or search for an address or business, just start typing and a card will appear which lets you choose Google, Google Maps, Wikipedia or Twitter. Adding custom ringtones and wallpapers is refreshingly easy; Similar to Android devices, you can plug the phone in, choose ""USB Storage"" and just drag your wallpaper images into the ""Wallpapers"" folder, and ringtones and notification sounds into the ""Ringtones"" folder.Overall, the phone looks cute and fits nicely in the pocket. The soft back cover is nice (I prefer soft touch to glossy plastic or even glass). It's a functional device that will provide you with entertainment, information and communication on the go. There is an app store and some widely used apps are available (Evernote, Pandora, Accuweather, a Twitter app, Facebook, Angry Birds, etc). And even though pretty much every smartphone has it, the mobile hotspot functionality comes in handy (if you pay for it).Despite it's crappy 2MP camera, fixed 8GB of storage (that's right, no MicroSD card slot) tiny, low quality screen (but at least it's glass and capacitive) and tiny keys, it's worth buying since it's only $40 off-contract here on Amazon. If HP didn't give up on WebOS and Palm devices, it would probably cost at least $250. So, it's not a bad deal. The only reason I bought it was for the price. I sold my iPhone 4 months ago and have been using a basic cell phone. I missed having an mp3 player, map, camera, casual game player and web browser on me. I'm not eligible for an upgrade for another year, I can't spend $500+ on a new phone at full retail, and I'm sick of sketchy Craigslist sales and used phones with scratched displays, caked up skin flakes and dirt in the crevices, and lingering cologne/perfume odors. Honestly, I was pleasantly surprised with WebOS. But the OS and the device itself are lacking - A LOT - and if there was a faster, better WebOS phone available for a typical smartphone retail price, I wouldn't buy it.Most people replace their smartphones within a year or two, so the fact that HP gave up on WebOS isn't that big of a deal. Just don't expect a ton of updates and support. The phone has 3-4 year old hardware anyway. If you're in a similar situation as I am (i.e., too poor to buy a new phone off contract, but not too poor to pay your share of a family account) or want a pre-paid phone, it's not a bad purchase. I could also see this being useful for someone who has an expensive smartphone but wants a second device when there may be a risk of losing or damaging their good phone.Too bad I couldn't get a Touchpad when the liquidation happened. That would have been nice. It's cool how they transfer links and other data. I ordered one from OnSale through Amazon. They took way more orders than they could fill and cancelled a ton of them after holding everyone's money for a few days. That sucked.","September 14, 2011",0

mobile phone,Verizon won't activate without data package.,Amazon Customer,R3D2GEUX7N64TF,3,I bought this for my daughter as a replacement phone on my Verizon contract account. Tried to activate it when I learned Verizon requires at least a $30 data package. They would not even activate it unless I agreed to this. I asked them to connect it and block the data like I had done with some of her other phones. Nope. So I am just returning it.

mobile phone,Consumed my entire $10 Page Plus PIN in first 5 minutes,Lin,R3282O47FYH4K4,3,"My rating subject to change, as follows. Here is what happened so far:Received phone in new condition after 72 hours from OEM Shop.My intended use: $30/yr emergency usage plan. ($10/120 day pin x 3)Activation of phone for free from PagePlus went smoothly. Purchased $10 PIN.Enabled wifi by clicking in upper right corner of phone app and clicking appropriate choice.Immediately turned off data connection by clicking Verizon in upper left corner of phone card and clicking preference (data off) immediately after activation.Was HORRIFIED when I got message saying my $10 credit was exhausted within a half hour of activating my advice, though I had not placed any calls or texts or downloaded content while on 3G.Called PagePlus to try to get them to reapply my $10 credit.They refused claiming that Palm Pixie is unauthorized and unsupported device.Requested to speak with supervisor and told I had to request a service ticket to do so and then a manager would call back within 24 hrs.After 22 hours with no callback, I called customer service and was connected with a friendly but ignorant customer service supervisor who informed me that she encounters this problem very frequently with Palm Pixie and that it will download data even with data is disabled.I questioned her intently about this (since it made no sense to me) and she repeated that even with wifi many of the apps in the phone, such as weather, will somehow use 3G data even when data is disabled. She said it is like a little computer and needs data.She suggested that if I wanted to use Palm Pixie I had better disable all Apps that came with the phone. Otherwise, her recommendation was to buy a standard supported cell phone (not smartphone) through PagePlus.I thanked her and planned to return Pixie to OEM Shop.Decided to call Palm support at 1-866-770-PALM to corroborate/verify Page Plus' information before returning device.After asking for details of my phone including serial number and phone number, Palm listened to what happened and what I was told by PagePlus.Palm emphatically and categorically denied that with data disabled the phone or any of its apps would still consume 3G data.As I had two conflicting opinions, I next called Kitty Wireless. Spoke with very polite and knowledgeable rep (Caleb) who confirmed what Palm told me and suggested that probably what had happened is that as soon as activation was complete and PIN was loaded, phone updated its system software and this used the $10 PIN I had purchased.Caleb assured me this is a very common problem and that it should not reoccur now that data is disabled and wifi is set-up.Said that he has heard of Android phones sometimes consuming data while in data disabled mode, but never with Palm Pixie.Suggested buying another $10 PIN, instead of more expensive PIN, just as a precaution.Asked him what is the main difference between Kitty Wireless and PagePlus.Caleb told me that Kitty is an authorized dealer of PagePlus and that biggest difference is the service.Kitty Wireless only has two employees, Kitty and Caleb, so customers get knowledgeable personal service.I thanked him and placed the order online for $10 PIN with auto refilling from Kitty Wireless.Assuming all goes well, I will not update this review. If it does not, and I continue to have problems of spurious data download while in data disabled mode, I will edit this review if possible, or find a way of entering a new one.****EDIT**** RATING REVISED TO 4 STARSReceived very helpful e-mail from Kitty at Kitty Wireless suggesting further measures to make 100% sure that phone does not consume data that I have not requested:""If you know, for a fact, that you will NOT be using data on your device - CALL 800-550-2436 and say this: ""I would like for you to disable the web data and the picture messaging features on my standard plan phone so that I do not mistakenly use my cash balance for data."" Give them your cellular number, and have them disable your data & picture messaging services. This will prevent you from losing ANY of your cash balance.""also provides this website for clarification: [ ... ]I am very impressed with Kitty Wireless so far, have done as she suggests, and am happy with Palm Pixie Plus so far, but will edit/revise as experience dictates [I've only had phone for 2 days]","August 18, 2011",0
mobile phone,"Things I wish I'd known. Then again, maybe not.",Richard C. Yeh,R2FW9DCZJITA6F,3,"This is a minimum viable smartphone toy --- for 2009.Things I love:1. Contact integration and auto-updating. If any of my LinkedIn or Facebook contacts changes their information, this phone's address book will be updated automatically. If I edit a contact on the phone or in my GMail address book, the change appears in the other place and vice versa. Same with my appointments, synchronized with Google Calendar.2. Not having to buy a data plan. Over the past year, I've bought this phone twice and used the Page Plus Cellular $80 refills to get $0.04 minute and SMS rates with the Verizon network, and all in, it has been $400 (including equipment, activation, and airtime). If the equipment holds up, I'm looking at about $300 next year. I don't use mobile data or roaming.3. Battery life without a data plan is excellent. I have the Wi-Fi (Wi-Fi Prefs -> menu -> Sleep Settings) turn off when the phone is sleeping (locked), and I can go almost a week without charging if I'm not reading too much e-mail on the device.4. Case can survive minor splashes.5. I can listen to streaming NPR.Things I find frustrating:Slow performance opening e-mail: it takes 7-10 seconds to open the list of messages, and 3-5 seconds more to display the body of very simple messages. When checking e-mail, it downloads all headers and then all bodies, consuming more data (and time) than an Android GMail app, which only downloads bodies on an as-needed or background basis. If you try to delete e-mail while messages are coming in, you can sometimes delete the wrong message. If you delete a message whose headers but not body have been received, the message will appear again after the body is received.Slow graphics transitions: when I answer the phone, it takes at least 3 seconds before I can see the buttons to put the call on speakerphone or mute. Sometimes, it's not clear that the speakerphone button has registered my tap, and I tap again. Contrast almost every Blackberry, with a dedicated key, allowing the switch to occur in a fraction of a second.Camera is extremely slow. It can take as much as 10 seconds to open and show a gray image before the app is ready to let you take a picture.Web browser runs out of memory on moderately complex pages.Minor user interface problems: in typing a text message, the ""send"" button is at the end of the line. This makes it difficult to reposition the cursor there if you jump back to edit something and then want to resume at the end, because you could accidentally hit the send button. (On the iPhone, the send button is away from the text. That couldn't be covered by a patent, could it?)When you set an alarm for a given time, if your phone has locked when the alarm rings, you need to unlock the phone in order to dismiss the alarm notification --- which can take a while if you have a security code. Once you have snoozed an alarm, there is no way to cancel that.Palm profile backup/restore needs cellular data and does not work over Wi-Fi.When mobile data is enabled, the phone is particularly data-hungry: 300 MB in one night, for no apparent reason.Why I bought a second phone (both from UnlockedCellPhoneKings): the screen cracked once when I dropped the first. And then, I found the keyboard was completely useless! I couldn't even connect a USB cable to copy any photos I had taken and then scrub the phone, because you need to confirm that you want to use the phone in USB mode via an on-screen button! The manual provides the following key-combination to reset and erase the phone, though: power-opt-sym.All in all, this phone let me try out a prepaid wireless plan. I like the plan, and at some point, I will come to my senses and try to activate a mainstream phone with my prepaid plan.Update (mid 2013): I am much happier with a Samsung Fascinate. The biggest drawback is the lack of a physical keyboard. A Droid 3 I tried had a very flaky keyboard.","December 22, 2012",0
mobile phone,Could've been better.,Kevin Mesch,R1MY3XX0P9RTAD,3,"I bought this phone back in 2010 and it was definitely an upgrade from a really old BlackBerry Pearl that only got Edge service, 3G didn't exist yet when this blackberry came out, (talking about the pixi now) and so it was fast, and oh-so small, the screen; perfect! Than that 3 month period comes, you've had for a while, you're acquainted with the phone, and you have your apps, and some music, pictures, contacts, maybe you bought the touch stone charger like me, and a green case. Than it's all down hill from there. Apps take longer to load, the camera takes longer to open, than it starts to overheat and the battery life changes and than the phone will start dying while in an app. Just turn off. Than the case you bought snaps on the sides, and the one year mark is here and your case is useless so you remove it so you look stupid with your battery and SIMcard showing. You loose all faith in the phone and buy something that was free from your companies store like an iPhone 3G-S.

mobile phone,I NEEDED a replacement phone,awesomenpretty,R1LZPGFYIQ1UAZ,3,"I lost my Droid Incredible and didn't want to fork out a lot of money to get a replacement, so I purchased the Palm Pixi Plus.When I first turned it on, I immediately noticed a broken pixel. For the most part it doesn't bother me. I only notice it if the background on the screen is black, against light colors it is not noticeable.Pro: When I activated the Pixi on my Verizon account I noticed that I got the Wifi Hotspot free (up to 5GB). I chatted w/a VZW rep prior to purchasing this phone and they told me I would not get the free Wifi Hotspot if I activatd the Palm Pixi Plus, but I think because of the unlimited data I have, it made the difference.Con: The keyboard keys are very small. My small girly fingers still have trouble sometimes when doing a lot of typing. You can install a virual keyboard but the screen on this phone is so small that the vitual keyboad takes up half the screen, and doesn't leave much room to see what you are typing out.The apps available through Palm are lame. I miss all the apps I was able to get from the Android Market :(The battery life is ok. If I use my phone to listen to a lot of music or if I use the Wifi Hotspot, I notice it drains the battery. I have to charge it by 5pm if I've been using it throught out the day. If I use it only for a few calls and a lot of messaging, then I can get by the whole day and only have to charge it at night before I go to bed.Overall this is an ok phone. For me, I would prefer something that runs on the Android system as I love to use so many apps and browse the web and text. But for someone who doesn't do much besides call & text and maybe some light web surfing then this phone will work great.","February 10, 2012",0

I ordered this phone because it didn't have a bunch of apps. on the front which confuse me. So it showed up in 2 days, packaged very well. I looked for the manual in the box and it wasn't there. OK, I'm mad now. I went to have it activated and that went smoothly. She said it looked pretty easy to understand and not to worry about the manual. I went home and tried to figure things out and couldn't find the speaker phone button on the outside of the phone. That's where it's supposed to be, right? Well, you have to open the phone where the keyboard is and push speaker phone, but you can't use speaker while the phone is closed. I do not like that feature at all. Also the screen on the front of the phone is pretty small which makes it more difficult. It's been a couple of weeks and I still am having trouble with the phone, trying to figure out things that should be easy to figure out. I'd really like to have my old phone back.

This solution worked well for my brother, but unfortunately my phone still shuts itself off even with a full charge and will not turn back on.

mobile phone,A Good Phone for People Who Can't Afford Others,M. Harris,R2JGT8S8UF7ZK1,3,"First off let me say that I've had quite a relationship with this phone. I've had ups and downs with it all the time. Here are some important points:1. The Screen - While it may not have the beauty of other phones, it certainly isn't hard to look at. The colors are all very nice, even the blacks are decent for a phone this price. It looks quite nice in the dark especially. The colors are warm, but not overly warm. There is no certain tint to the color, which is something that some high-end phones are missing. Reading is bearable on it, I had no problem reading long amounts of text at all. The pixels are visible, but if you don't look for them, you don't notice them. Actually, they are not that visible, much better than a lot of screens I've seen. While the screen is small compared to a lot of phones, in fact tiny, it's not horrible. But, if you plan on doing a lot of web browsing or movie-watching especially, then you will really enjoy a bigger screen. Even games. So, that is one major limitation of this phone.2. The Speed - A major problem with this phone is speed. Maybe several years ago, this would be considered fast. But nowadays, it's been left in the dust by dual-core processors, quad-core even. This clocks in at 600 MHz single-core. Ouch! Phones usually have at least 1.2 GHz dual-core. And you will see the difference immediately. Applications sometimes open very slowly, things that you would think should be flawless. A lot of times, even if all background programs are closed (I use Advanced Task Killer - works like a charm most of the time, greatly improves performance) the lock screen can freeze up at times. Sometimes that can make the phone unusable, but luckily you just wait a few seconds and it catches itself up. When browsing desktop-sized websites, there can be MAJOR freeze-ups. A lot of times, the status bar keeps saying that something is loading, which it is. But it's only loading one object many times. Because of that one object that refuses to load, the page looks all messed up. And since the browser doesn't have flash, there are a lot of times when things refuse to load. If you're going to browse especially picture-heavy sites like Engadget, good luck! It's a stuttering nightmare even after you wait a while after the page is fully loaded. So be patient if you want to do that kind of web browsing. Mobile sites, however, don't have a problem at all usually, but even they lack the smoothness they should have. When it comes to playing games, there is a lot of stuttering (lag) as well. Most games have at least a little, and many games like Temple Run cannot even be played on this phone due to its slow processor. What I just listed is not even close to all of the limitations the processor creates.3. The Battery - You would think a phone that doesn't have much speed would be a battery-saver. You would think it wouldn't use much energy. Well folks, you're sadly mistaken, and because of the fact that the processor has to work so hard to do the simplest of things, the battery life can be very short. It's enough to get through the day, depending on how much you use it. But trust me, I've come close to fully draining the battery a lot of times. Hooking up WiFi instead of its 3G connection is a major power saver, so you might want to consider that. It's easy enough to do. But on 3G, it drains like crazy.4. The network - All of Virgin Mobile's phones work on Sprint's network. While Sprint has been around for a long time, they still don't have a decent network built up. The speeds are atrocious sometimes, and coverage, oh boy, that's even worse. I found out that the speeds are always less than 1MBPS. Networks like AT&T; can get far better speeds, on 3G. This phone has no 4G, so that's yet ANOTHER limitation. However, even though those numbers are low, it's not the worst. Pages tend to be fast. They are usually close to WiFi. But downloads on WiFi are SO much faster. And in my home, even though I live in a decent-size city, has poor coverage. I used to have a Net10 phone, which runs off of AT&T; and T-Mobile's network, which was faster. What a shame. Sprint's network is just so unstable. For a while, I used to have no service in my home. At least now that's fixed, I guess.There are more limitations than what I listed, but there is one thing that everyone, including me, has to remember. The monthly bill is only $35. That's lower than any other carrier, so the saying, ""You get what you paid for"" works well here. So, I guess for such a great price I can't complain much. But if you're coming from contract, or like me looking to go onto contract, you will probably be disappointed if you purchase this phone, or for that matter any phone from Virgin Mobile.Overall, I still manage to get some use out of the phone. And by the way, it has a low memory capacity (internal) which is another major setback. A lot of times, a message comes up saying it's low. It's a major annoyance, so some more memory would be wonderful. But now that I've taken out a lot of apps and games, it works well for the most part. I can't wait to move onto something better though.","March 4, 2012",0
mobile phone,Great phone BUT...,"Antonia M, PhD ""The Inner Power Doctor""",R1BZ9R66PH1SIU,3,"And this is a big BUT for me...the internal memory is sooooo small (179 MB). The descriptions I've read on this phone conveniently fail to mention the small internal memory. This is my first smartphone and in this day and age it just never occurred to me that this would be an issue, considering how people do everything on their phones these days and especially since you can get an SD card--which I did. As a newbie, what I didn't know was that you can't put everything on the SD card. There are many applications that force you to store them on the internal memory. So I have found myself constantly having to delete applications because I keep running out of space. It is incredibly frustrating for many reasons, including the fact that I can't get email, text messages, or dial the phone easily when the memory is full. (In fact, today I missed an important message for this very reason).Going to web pages can be painfully slow as well--it sometimes reminds me of being on dialup. However, I do appreciate being able to do all this on my phone. Aside from these two issues, I otherwise really like this phone (or maybe it is more accurate to say I really like Android, the swype keyboard, and the apps I have downloaded). The camcorder is descent. The camera is ok in a pinch--the quality is not great and the zoom is not useful. It certainly can't, as I hoped, replace my digital camera (which is at least 7 years old). I guess there's a trade off when you have these all-in-one devices.But it seems to me I will eventually need to ""root"" my phone and do some things that other reviewers have mentioned to resolve the space and speed issues. I am giving the phone 3 stars for this reason. I shouldn't have to hack and tinker with the phone (or in my case get someone to hack and tinker with it for me) to that extent to get it to perform better. I paid a lot more than 90-something dollars for this phone (although the virgin mobile plan was cheaper back then so, that makes up for it I guess).So before settling on this phone, see if there is another one that also gives you more internal memory and better performance when accessing the web. And maybe a better camera if you will be using that feature a lot.","February 29, 2012",0
mobile phone,"Good price, but got worse over time",lorakreg,R3TTK2Q0F7PYOO,3,"I got this phone March 2011, and am still using it (January 2012). For the price, there's not much to compare it to. Through Virgin Mobile, I pay $25 a month for unlimited text/data, and 300 minutes. I bought the phone from Best Buy for around $130. I was grateful that there was finally an affordable smart phone on the market.The problem? Almost from the day I got it, I could tell that this phone isn't up to par. Apps take a long time to load, don't load, or even crash the whole system. There are some apps, specifically higher quality games, that will waste half my battery before finally loading. Even texting/calling messes up. It's happened a few times that the phone froze mid-call, disabling me from disconnecting. I had to take the battery out to disconnect the call. In fact...I have to take the battery out to solve about 30% of the app-crashing problems. The longer I had the phone, the worse it got.Battery life is poor. Without apps like Juice Defender (helps to conserve battery life by disabling data connections, etc), it doesn't last long. I don't think I've ever gone a full day without using data, so I can't tell for sure what it's like if you just text/call. One time, I accidentally left my phone at home for the day. I came home to a completely depleted battery (5% or less) 11 hours later. I had received zero calls and less than five texts.I've also noticed that the phone overheats pretty easily. Literally overheats. The battery gets hot to the touch (not more than 90-100 degrees). This greatly diminishes its ability to work normally.Like I said, nothing can beat Virgin Mobile prices. When I got this phone, it was one of the best that they offered. Even though I have issues with this phone (and sometimes VM in general), no way would I pay traditional cell phone bills. But, keep in mind, you'll get what you paid for! This phone is flawed and designed to break down.","January 17, 2012",0
mobile phone,"Phone is great, Virgin Mobile is not",Jennifer R,R1NAY139G3H853,3,"First things first, as a phone in this price range, this is an excellent product. I was skeptical about swype typing, but am currently finding it pretty ingenious, although I do prefer a keypad. I tried the Samsung Intercept for that reason, but the processor in that thing is too slow, making programs like maps and youtube pointless. However, the process of converting my service to a new phone has been PAINFUL.This phone, as another user commented, is connected to the Virgin Mobile service. Unlike a more expensive service like Verizon, your customer service calls go to the Phillipines, where attendants are speaking according to a menu, and there is an irksome delay. It is very difficult and time consuming to get anything important through to the next tier of tech crew in America who can do anything. In my case, I received a phone from Amazon that had the same Serial # as another user's phone across the state. I unwittingly activated my service on his phone, and was without my own service for days before I was contacted ""in 1 to 5 business days"" for the first series of troubleshooting (which didn't work). The more local (I'm assuming east coast) customer rep was really friendly and able to compensate me for the lost time and get the problem worked up another tier. Still waiting on a working phone here, though. It's a good thing I have the week off and wifi in the house - I'd be tearing my hair out otherwise!Luckily I can use google voice and a $4 application called Groove IP on the phone in the meantime. Virgin mobile (on the sprint 3G network) doesn't work in my apartment anyway (densely populated Oakland, go figure!), and I mostly use wi fi on my phone and the computer to make calls. That means I don't rack up any minutes with Virgin.I think that Virgin Mobile is worth it for their $25/mo plan (300 min, unlimited data/text) - at that price, I feel I am getting what I paid for. They just raised their prices to $35/mo for 300 anytime minutes, unlimited data and texting, and $45 for a 1200 min plan (that's right, nothing in between). At that price, I'd be disappointed and probably switch to Metro PCS, which has physical stores and none of the outsourcing.","August 13, 2011",0
mobile phone,Started strong initially,Kelly Knauth,R13BIEGEF9P7AE,3,"I bought the LG Optimus Prepaid Android Phone in September 2011 and by January 2012 it was already starting to crap out. Initially it was great. Fast internet, no dropped calls, neat apps, decent battery life. Now the phone turns itself off mysteriously even with a full battery. (Usually when I actually need to make a phone call.) The internet is super slow and not worth using and the battery life is horrible. I charge it overnight and by afternoon it's dead.

mobile phone,Always Low On Space,Jeff,R22O365TLG7QSC,3,"(Note: I did not purchase this phone through Amazon)I've been using this phone since about mid-December. I'm very pleased with the service from Virgin Mobile so far.My only gripe - and it's a major one - is that this phone is ALWAYS RUNNING LOW ON SPACE!This is my first ""smart phone."" I've had an iPod Touch for about 3 years and I've had no problems installing apps on that, so long as the operating system is compatible.Androids aren't as user friendly. True, I can add up to 32 gigs with a memory card, but certain apps (like Facebook) can only run on the phone's memory. The phone itself has only 178 megabytes of memory.I don't spend tons of time talking on the phone. I could have saved another ten bucks with the 300 talk minute plan, but $45 is still a pretty good price to insure that I'm covered. I got this phone to have internet on the go. Over the past month I've had to make some hard choices as to what apps I wanted to keep in order to clear up space on the phone. I run an app that easily moves apps off of the phone and on to the card, and also clears the phone's cache. I've done everything I could think of the clear up space on the phone, but it still persists.I'm giving this a 3 star rating, because aside from this issue, the phone runs pretty well and I'm fine with the service.UPDATE:So soon? Yes.When I got home from work today my phone was unresponsive. It would not turn on. I plugged it into the computer, took the battery out and replaced it. Nothing worked. I called Virgin. They told me to take the battery out and plug it into an outlet. Only then did it work. Turns out I have a bad battery. A problem that seems to plague this phone. They're sending me a new battery.","January 23, 2012",0
mobile phone,50% as good as a phone that costs 5 times as much,Dayton,R10PGXX2YTR5SM,3,"----October 13, 2012 update----This phone seems to be rapidly deteriorating. The screen and buttons frequently become non-responsive. If I'm reading a newspaper app I can typically get through a few articles before it gets stuck and I have to take the battery out. When it gets stuck the power button doesn't do anything.----June 8, 2012 update---Space on the phone's internal memory ran out on me so I've moved my apps to the SD card. This definitely decreases the stability of the phone. Sometimes the icons will all turn into the stock android app icon and when I click on any of them the message ""this application is not installed on your phone"" comes up. Sometimes the problem resolves itself after a few seconds, but sometimes I get impatient and restart the phone. Maybe it would always fix itself if I waited long enough. Also, the phone seems to freeze more often than it did before. I end up taking the battery out about once a day. It seems that when it freezes up the power button is useless so you can't restart it without cutting the power. I still like it overall, but I'm feeling the difference between this and an iPhone more than I was before.-----original review-------After being an iPhone user for 4 years, this phone is not as much worse as I expected. Here are the differences I have found to be meaningful after a few weeks:-Screen size: The 0.3 inch difference in screen size between this and the iPhone sounded negligible to me, but I have found that it is much harder to type on this phone, using either of the preloaded keyboards or downloading others that claim to be better. Also, most Android apps are clearly optimized for a larger screen. Not infrequently I come across pages where you need to type something and find that when the keyboard opens up the only thing I can see is the header on the app or webpage, so I can't actually see what I'm typing. This difficulty compounds the super narrow keys on the keyboard.-Stability: In the first few weeks it has frozen a couple times such that the only thing I can do to get it to respond is to take out the battery and put it back in. Other things crash maybe once a day, not enough to annoy me.-Battery life: I speak on the phone very little, but I have some app or other open and use the internet and GPS quite a bit. A couple of times it has died on me late in the day after I'm already home, but usually it has a few percent at least left. If you plan to talk on the phone a lot or for some reason find it inconvenient to charge it up every night the battery life would be a problem.-Voicemail: I'm not sure if this is because of the phone or Virgin Mobile, but you have to call your voicemail to get your messages and go through that painfully slow old-fashioned system of listening to the computer voice tell you the number of messages, the phone numbers, when the call was, etc. This is much less convenient than having all your messages listed on a screen where you can see the time and name or number to play or delete with the touch of a button.Other than that, all my thoughts about the phone have more to do with Android vs. iOS rather than the Optimus V itself. This phone is clearly not as luxurious as an iPhone or a much more expensive Android phone. It is a great way to save money by trading down or a cheap way to trade up from a not-so-smartphone.One last note: get the GrooveIP app and a Google Voice number. You can place and receive all your calls over the data network with your unlimited data plan instead of using your very limited minutes. I use 90% of my minutes with my girlfriend so I only had to give her my Google Voice number and have plenty of minutes for other people who call me. The voice quality is a little bit tinnier and washed out than over a regular call, but it's not a big difference. The biggest problem is that there's about a 2 second round-trip lag (if I say something and am on speakerphone I don't hear my echo for about that long, is what I mean). You have to learn a hint of patience so you don't end up talking over the other person.I'd rather have an iPhone, but I'd rather rather save $1,400 over the course of two years.","April 30, 2012",0

mobile phone,"OK Phone, horrid network","Amazon Customer ""traveler""",R20SM9Y31DW50C,3,"I purchased this phone to use while travelling. The phone is ok, but not great. Many apps are not compatible with it. Notice when you look at apps how many say not compatible with the LG Optimus. The battery life is decent, if you turn off the wifi. With it on, it is pretty bad. I lose the battery overnight, if I do not remember to turn off the wifi. Although I knew that the network might not be the best, I did expect to have service most of the time. That did not turn out to be the case. No reception at my home. No reception the entire way across Oklahoma, Kansas and most of Colorado. Very slow when it does work, even with five bars. Generally, I find it to be barely usable. After my next vacation, I will likely let the service go and use it for a handy small ebook reader and wifi device. Once I quit working and no longer have my office assigned Verizon blackberry (which worked in all of these places), I will have to decide if I want to pay Verizon's outrageous prices to have data service on a regular basis.My other issue is with Virgin Mobile. It apparently does not wait to reassign numbers. I have received numerous calls from bill collectors (all for the same person), obscene texts (from someone looking for the same individual, obviously thinking they still had this number) and many voice mails which use up my minutes, but have never been for me. Including service appointments from Dish Network. Virgin Mobile basically said, ""too bad.""Update: I tried again. We just took a two week trip through the Pacific Northwest. The service was still spotty at best. I'm going to give it one more try in November, but suspect this is going to turn into merely a wifi device. Although the price for VM service is cheap, it isn't worth much when you can't use it anywhere except metropolitan ares, which, by the way, did not include Vancouver, Wa.","July 4, 2012",0

It is light, small, and feels fairly sturdy. I love the Swype function in Android (let's you write words without lifting your finger--very helpful). I have had no problems with this phone and am very happy with the purchase. When using a bunch of applications, the battery is pretty short lived, but I don't know that any phone would do better. Overall, I am very satisfied and definitely recommend!UPDATE: This phone has way too little internal storage. I don't use very many apps, but I now get a low storage warning all the time. I've deleted what I can spare and cleared all texts, etc, but it's not enough. All other people that I know who have this phone have the same problem. I can't even receive texts anymore!

mobile phone,"Nice phone for the price, but 3g data issues are widespread","G. Rao ""grao!!!""",RQ6G5I3BIE3K1,3,"The VM Optimus V is my first smartphone. I got one after seeing other people use the same phone on the Sprint network, and being impressed by it.My old phone was a no-frills clamshell, the LG VX3850, on Verizon Wireless. The difference in functionality-to-price ratio between the old phone and the Optimus V is night and day. Unfortunately, so is the difference in reliability. The Verizon phone never let me down even once, even when it broke at the clamshell hinge. The Virgin Mobile phone loses it's data connection every few days, it seems like, and I've seen the drop last for 48 hours at a time.Google the phrase ""time without signal"" and ""Optimus V"" and you'll see a large number of references to the problem from around the country. There are a variety of suggested workarounds posted on various message boards, like toggling airplane mode, rebooting the phone, and changing settings on the test menu, but in my case, none of them really helped. When I emailed VM about the problems I was having, they took 3 days to respond, and acknowledged that there was a problem with their network.You can check your phone's time w/o signal status in the battery usage menu under the about phone menu in system settings. In my case, the number generally hovers around 50%.So keep this in mind if you're going to buy this phone. It will only be functional about 50% of the time. I'm still leaning towards keeping the VM phone and porting my old Verizon number to it, because the features and price are still attractive.Battery life typically lasts me a day and a half, with the use of a battery saving app, and about 12 hours without an app installed. GPS works very well with Google maps and navigator apps. There's even a Quick Settings app which enables you to toggle on the phone's wifi hotspot feature, thus allowing you to tether other devices to it and access the internet through the phone's 3g connection.Every now and then a text message I sent will be delivered to the other party a day or two late. I'm not sure what the excuse is for this, because sms messages are sent over the voice network, as I understand it.I have reconciled myself to the idea that this phone is really only meant for light use, as I have other communications options available to me for most of the day. If this were my only option, and I used the phone all day long, it simply would not be enough.However, as a portable wifi/gps-enabled device, it's really not a bad deal, provided you find it for the standard $150 retail price. I also own an Archos 70it, and I think the Optimus is the better designed, more useable device. Any Android tablet that is more functional than the Optimus is going to cost close to $300 at this point in time. Any better Android smartphone is going to require a 2 year service contract.Even if you don't want to use Virgin Mobile's crappy phone service, the device is still useful for browsing and gps mapping.I haven't decided yet whether I want to stick with Verizon and return this phone to Radio Shack, but if I went that route, I would probably opt to upgrade to Verizon's equivalent of the Optimus.","April 4, 2011",0

It was my first Android phone and I was rather impressed with both the phone and Android Gingerbread.After about three months, the phone would turn itself off. I drove 45 minutes to the AT&T; service center where they managed to get my data off the phone and switched it out. On the ride home I realized that the GPS was not working so the next day I returned to the service center. That phone seemed to work for about a week but then it too had problems. Once again I returned to the service center and they attempted to swap out the phone and could not get the replacement to work. After an hour of trying they gave up and swapped it to a different phone.After less then 24 hours, that phone stopped seeing the SD card. After numerous attempts to re-seat it the phone finally would see it without issue. I continues on with that phone until about a week ago.About one week ago my phone started to reboot itself. Then it started not being able to detect wireless networks, showing only 'error' when you looked at the WiFi settings. And then it started loosing and re-finding the SIM card. I started turning the phone off at night and finally removing the SD card as while sitting perfectly still on my nightstand it will find and initialize then loose the SD card.

This phone is a replacement for the HTC Vivid I dropped in the river while Tiki tubing. It is an ok phone at best. There is only one camera on this phone and it sucks, big time. (you can forget about Tango) You better be very still or it's going to be blurry. Also, the inspire is pretty slow, when trying to do multiple things at once, it starts doing weird things...freezing for example. Sometimes when I unlock the screen, the camera is on, or the world clock is showing. I don't get that at all. Maybe I got a lemon, but who knows. It still has the little green man for your emoticons...I don't like him for some reason...lol Anyways, if I had it to do again, I wouldn't.","September 15, 2013",0

It drops service when I am googling or doing something else, i.e. using navigation or other application. I'm trying to be patient and hope it'll all work out.

mobile phone,Not great but not that bad,elsa mehdizadeh,R1AS0QF4TXU3B,3,"The phose has a lot of capacities.Several issues I had (and have):- It is indeed an unlocked phone. You can use it to call and tx msg. To use internet you have to change some datas manually. I called my company (T-mobile) and they helped me with that. But you won't be able to use the 4G even if your sim card is AT&T.; You need a plan for that. This is something you should be aware of! Don't buy this phone for it's 4G: it won't work!- An huge issue that I had: the phone was freezing ALL THE TIME - it was crazy.... But I read about it on internet, and this issue seems to be pretty common with this phone. A solution exist: to download Launcher Ex. I don't use the htc sense anymore but the launcher and I never had this problem anymore. The phone works good, but I have a problem finding some applications and widgets I use to have...- An other thing that I don't like is that when I download applications some of them won't go on the SD card and can only be in the phone memory. This is something that really bother me because I have the phone for more or less 1 or 2 month and the phone memory is already half full and my SD card is almost empty and there is nothing I can do about that! Also, the fact that you have to move each application manually from the phone memory to the SD card each time you download an application is annoying too... it should be automatic!!!If you can deal with this issues then the phone is fine. I am still happy about this phone because I really needed an unlocked phone (because I travel all the time - even if i have no idea yet if it is going to work with a foreign sim card...), that goes on internet!Also if you live in the USA, many prepaid plan are available that are not very expensive and would let you do most of the things you need...So overall: it is not a bad deal and it is the price to pay to be free and not stuck with a 2 years plan!","April 1, 2013",0

mobile phone,slow but convinient... sometimes,"Josh Blum ""Josh Blum""",R2UQYJSQAQMQVW,3,"this phone, i guess, isnt terreble. the nice thing overall is that it is android of coarse and i can get facebook and youtube and a lot more while im on the go. i can also play some games but a lot of games you cant really play because it is too slow and laggy. for example i cant play angry birds because the phone simply just cant handle it aka the game is too fast for the phone.also, it freezes a lot and i often have to reboot it. a lot of times when im just simply sending a text message or updating my status on facebook i press a letter and it takes like 10 seconds or more just for one letter to appear on the screen. the phone also freezes when you are in the middle of doing something and especially while your on the internet. and sometimes, just out of the blue, your just going through settings and it will freeze or lag like crazy. and a lot of times the little touch buttons on the bottom of the phone aka the settings, home, back, and search buttons are not responsive and you end up pushing them more than once and then it will just completely freeze. and a lot of times if you just slide open the keyboard it will just completely freeze or you just have to wait a long time for the screen to turn sideways.however, a lot of times it isnt like this. sometimes it will work great but probably the best thing to do when the phone starts getting slow and laggy, just to take out the battery if it is completely unresponsive or just to turn it off and turn it back on. dont leave the phone on all the time because sometimes it just needs a break.like i said however, it is a nice phone to have but i wouldnt get it if you dont have the patients to wait for it to load sometimes or else you will probably end up either chucking it, seeing if it floats, getting a hammer, or all of the above :) fortunatley i do have the patients for it so that is why i didnt put it as a one star because it is a convinient phone like i said in the begining it is nice to know that you can get your facebook notifications and text messages and emails and a ton more and it is all in your front pocket. but if you have a short patience fuze... i would reccomend paying the 300 + dollars to get the optomus or something that you likely wouldnt destroy :) o and btw... you can also get your music on the phone and if you download the app music download from the android market, you just have to search for a song or artist and it will pop up and you can download all of your music for free and its not illegal :) just thought id throw that in there","December 6, 2011",0

mobile phone,"Call & Text, but not so much for Android...",Irineo Placido-Lopez,R36HMTY7NLWZ41,3,"This is a review of the Samsung Intercept from Virgin Mobile. This is a decent phone for the value. Virgin Mobile probably offers the cheapest plans on Android Phones. With that said this phone does Run Android, but it is not very powerful. I can imagine that better phones will have a much better experience on the user, but this one is decent if you plan on NOT using its Android Services as much. For Example:When you try to play a game such as Angry Birds it will open; however, it requires a great deal of time to open due to the phones speed. Once the game opens the game plays perfectly except for one issue.... It lags. Don't expect to play games as well as you would on an iPod Touch or an iPhone with a faster processor with this phone.Its battery life is decent aswell. I say it can last a good 4-5 hours of continuous usage or maybe barely make it through an entire day if you don't use it as much.Its keyboard is absolutely perfect! It is probably the best part of this phone. If you are planning on texting a lot than this is an awesome keyboard. It is backlit and it looks great at night.Its touch screen is ok and it is usable even with its slow processor.Overall I would use this phone for Calling and Texting only and maybe the occasional internet use. If you are looking for a good Android phone I would recommend going for something a bit better than this one. I rate this product 3 stars out of 5 stars.I hope this review helped you out!","September 2, 2012",0
mobile phone,Decent phone but has it's problems,Steven Hilbert,R1GYL2W5S71NJJ,3,"It's a good phone when it works correctly. Picture messaging on Virgin Mobile is a big problem with this phone, not just for me but I read a lot of forums that say the same thing. Sending and receiving picture messages works sometimes and other times you just get error messages. Turning the phone off and then on again sometimes works but it's like rebooting a computer and it takes a while. This is actually a problem with Virgin Mobile and not specifically the phone itself but I thought I would mention it. They supposedly have a ""fix"" for it coming soon. The phone itself freezes up sometimes which is annoying. The touchscreen itself as well as the four main buttons at the bottom can be frustrating. I own an ipod touch and the touchscreen on that is perfect. But with the Samsung Intercept, sometimes you have to try four or five times to get the touchscreen to work properly. The battery life is also horrible. I actually upgraded to this phone because I had to recharge my old phone every day. Well apparently the APPS on the Samsung Intercept use up a lot of battery life because I have to charge the phone up every day and that's even when I barely use it. And I only have 4 APPS downloaded that I use. The bright spot is the nice big slide out keyboard. The buttons are just the right size. The problem is that when I slide it out I'm either hitting the volume button or activating something on the touchscreen. Of course there is the Android market that has tons of APPS that you can download, most of which I find useless, but some are good. I do find it convenient that it has APPS for Yahoo mail and Facebook. But for a $200 phone I'm disappointed that it doesnt work better.","February 21, 2011",0

mobile phone,Not sure android on this device is such a good idea.,harmono,R2ORCDU8JPDQRY,3,"I previously owned a Sprint HTC 4G Evo which I was paying a TON of money for each month. I then acquired an iPad, and found that for half the price I could have Verizon 3G and this Virgin Mobile phone. I thought I might have withdrawls from my EVO so I bought this fancy pre-paid phone with Android. Right now I'm thinking (more like dreaming) of taking it back and getting the Triumph. I would say if you can't afford much and would like to experience Android, you might want to consider this. The problems I'm finding is the Android interface doesn't seem to fit the size of this screen well.Also there are some really clunky things about the interface (and it seems the Triumph has this also). You have to slide a red phone icon to hang up? This seems cumbersome, and meaningless. The EVO seems to work better. I can barely read the display. I'm not having really bad withdrawals since I do have the iPad, but it seems I can't go without the iPad now. I was in a hospital and the 3G reception was non-existent. It seems slow on the 3G side, a bit of a joke really.If you have more than one or two running services it is really sluggish, and the web browser barely works, hitting the back key is either sluggish or fails. It's cool having an Android, but don't be disappointed if it's not really that easy to use with such a small screen. I have not had many other issues, the battery life is ok, but i'm used to keeping it on a charger all the time. Oh and it was nagging me with notifications all the time that I could not figure out what they were, so I turned off audible notifications.","September 20, 2011",0

mobile phone,"Marginal service, Terrible support, Buggy phone, otherwise great","Stephen Sedmak ""steve""",R27UNSL74EJWTX,3,"Virgin Mobile's Beyond Talk Plan is plagued by random loss of 3G service upon contract renewal due to VM's own system issues which they haven't fixed after several months. This is an infurating problem which happened to me while on vacation and relying on 3G for navigation. No matter what I did, 3G always redirected to Virgin Mobile's site. I spent about 4 hours of my vacation going back and forth with tech support, which proved useless. They never even mentioned that this is a common known issue, rather they acted like it has never happened to anyone ever before. Then I threatened to report Virgin Mobile to the BBB for fraud. The next day my 3G was working fine, imagine that.On top of that, Virgin Mobile's top-up system is unable to process my credit card for no apparent reason so I need to buy top-up cards from the local drug store. My card works fine everywhere else including on Amazon.com, and my previous carrier: Sprint! (note: Virgin Moble USA is an offshoot of Sprint)The Samsung Intercept's notification bar randomly locks up. Once that happens either you must reboot the phone (which takes 2 minutes) or you need to hold down the home button until the list of apps is displayed, then click the back button (takes about 5 seconds). This is undocumented and rather annoying if you don't know about the home/back fix.Other than those three troubling issues, the device works fairly well. I just hope Virgin Mobile fixes their contract renewal issues, since those are just simply unacceptable.For accessories, I recommend the Body Glove ""case"", the XtremeGuard screen protector, and an iPad-rated 2.1 amp car charger, preferably one with a secondary 1 amp socket (few other car chargers seem reliable)","February 22, 2011",0

mobile phone,Great Price - Buyer Beware,Vivacior,R1QC9JFU7KZ3TC,3,"First, I'd like to say that I am not a huge cell-phone user. I have an Ooma (bought here on Amazon) for my home service, which is great - haven't paid a land-line phone bill since 2010. I do not spend that much time on the road - as I am not in a sales or on-site service profession. With this, I've kept a low-cost, pay-as-you-go cell-phone for many years. I use a cell-phone for emergencies, when the power/internet is out at home, and for when I am out of the house and am expecting to make or receive an important call.For the first several years, I used Virgin Wireless - which was great until last year when my kids lost the phone. Starting a new plan with a new phone with Virgin became a much more expensive proposition - it felt a little like a ""bait-and-switch/the drugs are free for the first year"" scheme. I guess the bean-counters working for Richard Branson decided that being a low-cost provider just wasn't profitable enough: They got a jealous taste for all the ""sheeple"" who blindly sign up for the $60-$100/month plans that have transformed Verizon into a money-consuming Jabba-the-Hut. (Honestly, how many people REALLY need $1000+/year phone service - what a bunch of lemmings...!)Ergo, I checked into my local Wally World (walmart) and found this awesomely cheap phone with a perfectly-priced plan for my needs. So, here's the good, the bad, the ugly:The GoodPrice-price-price - 10 bucks up front, $23 every 3 months. This gets you 100 minutes for that entire time, but I've never used up my minutes. That said, if you were to use more minutes, you can get an even cheaper rate (cents/minute-wise) by buying your minutes in bulk. Reception is nothing special, but it's not terrible either.The BadLet's face it - this is what is now known as a ""FEATURE PHONE"" (aka ""NOT a Smart Phone"", aka ""Old People's Phone"", aka ""Dork-Phone""). Released in 2004, it screams ""I am so-behind-the-times/this is the same phone my parents use"" to anyone who knows gadgets. If you're a ""too cool for school"" kind of person, this phone is not for you. If you still have a tube-based, non-flat screen TV in your living room, then step right up!The UglyEven at this price, I am flabbergasted - you CANNOT LOCK this phone to deactivate the keys while you are traveling. As such, if you want to receive calls while you have it in your pocket/purse/gym bag/etc, it has to be ACTIVE the entire time. And with that, expect it to make unwanted phone-calls, web-browsing sessions, and text messages whenever the phone touches anything. You will get charged for these erroneous ""butt dials"", but there is nothing you can do about it. Except turn the phone off - and miss all incoming phone calls while you are on the move (which defeats 50% of the whole purpose for having a cell phone!).Conclusion - great price, old-school look and features, and a horrible-design FAIL on the ability to prevent ""butt-dialing"". If you own this phone, you WILL accidentally call, text, or browse.Caveat Emptor ""Buyer Beware""","November 5, 2012",0

I was in a pinch because my old one broke and I did not have time to research this phone very much. They allow you to preview the phone for a month and still return it. However I did not begin to notice until it was after this 30 day period. That the lock button still allowed functions to run (such as web browsing) and it would not unlock every time. I had to take the battery out to reboot. Anyway I bought a different phone Samsungt404g which I expect to be much better.

The processor cannot keep up with web browsing at times and the phone goes into meltdown and shuts down. Sometimes it even does this in the middle of the night and I get woken by '... VIRGIN MOBILE....'. Yes, I could turn it off but it is my alarm clock and why the heck should I anyway? The phone should work.Will never buy a Motorola again.Apart from that, the phone does it's job and is easy to use.

mobile phone,"Not for people who want something that ""just works""",CA_CPA,R1D50CYEJNHOQT,3,"My Triumph stopped receiving text messages because it kept creating a massive text file- ""alog_event"". To delete it, you have to either ""root"" the phone, install a new OS, which requires rooting, or do a full factory reset. This does not happen to everyone, but it did happen to me. The battery life was really bad, too. You have to go into the settings and turn off a lot of the background features to preserve battery life, or get a battery management app.I am not a heavy phone user and I got this phone for work email and the low monthly price. I ended up installing a new OS on it and it works fine now. Putting the new OS on it was not hard, but it does require finding instructions online and is a little intimidating.

mobile phone,"Nice hardware specs, poor execution",Skeptic,RVC2X8TTSFEA9,3,"Introduction.============My review is based on ownership period of three weeks of the phone with software build 039 (latest at the moment). I have pretty good grasp on technology and I tried every possible workaround short of flashing a custom ROM to make this phone work as it should. I own also LG Optimus V (Virgin Mobile) and will draw parallels between the two phones.Pros:=====+ 4.1"" large bright screen. After that screen size, it is tough to go back to 3.2"" screen of Optimus.+ Fast CPU/GPU combination. Angry Birds, Greed Corp, Age of Conquest run smooth like a butter. Optimus stutters on some Angry Birds levels.+ Great for browsing web.+ Great for watching videos.+ Thin case.+ HDMI out.+ OK front facing camera.+ LED flash that works.+ Can shoot mediocre 720p videos.+ 1Gb of internal RAM allows to install tons of apps. LG Optimus has only 140Mb.Cons:=====- Angular design makes it harder to remove from / put in the pocket and not very comfortable to hold to ear. My next phone will have rounded edges.- Weak cell signal strength compared to LG Optimus.- Weaker 3G signal strength compared to LG Optimus. Pandora on normal quality setting results in incomplete and looped playback.- 1380mah battery drains very fast (drains 10% per hour in standby with 3G off, GPS off, WiFi off, animations off, haptic feedback off, vibrate off). Optimus has 1500mah battery that I recharge only once every other day.- Light blue hue of the display, like color temp was set to over 6,500k.- Touch screen gets often unresponsive. It takes sometimes 3-4 presses to launch an app.- Calls using speakers result in low volume and echo on the other side.- Calls through ear piece were sometimes reported slightly distorted and low volume.- While listening music, notifications lower the volume of music and it stays low after the notification sound.- Very low call volume over Arctic Sound P311 Bluetooth Headset (Black). LG Optimus had no issues at all.- Android keyboard does not auto-correct and auto-suggest, no matter if all settings are set up properly. I recommend downloading Gingerbread Keyboard app from the market which has it working.- Very, very slow GPS satellite acquisition. It takes up to 5 minutes sometimes outdoors.Conclusion:===========The main mobile phone purpose for me is to make good quality calls. Most issues I described are reported to be fixed by custom ROMs, which I will not do. Motorola Triumph was shipped back last morning. In my opinion as it stands now, LG Optimus V is the best Android smartphone on Virgin Mobile. If you want to stick with Virgin Mobile, I recommend keeping Optimus V. Triumph is not worth the hassle.I hope Virgin will bring more 4.1-4.3"" phones. I will test drive Boost Mobile 4.3"" ZTE Warp. Boost also offers slick looking 4"" Nova Display LG Marquee . Knowing that Boost runs on the same Sprint Network and owned by Sprint as Virgin Mobile, I might jump the ship.","April 15, 2012",0
mobile phone,Ignore the website -- Data isn't unlimited!!!,djla,R3F6AF8RHEUSDS,3,"The second day I had this phone I got a notification from Virgin Mobile that as of 3/23/12 that they were changing the unlimited data plan to a 3GB limit; after that they slow the speed to 256K. Notably, they haven't bothered to mention that or update their website! Well, it seems I'm not getting 3G most of the time anyways, so the good news is that I'm pretty sure that unless I'm trying to download 24/7, I won't make the 3GB!!I like the phone, though the Gmail app has major problems with setting up accounts. Had to change the password multiple times until I had one that the phone decided was legit. Once I had the account established, it was no problem to change the password again, but a major hassle to get it working.

mobile phone,Solid Android Phone that Needs Work,"Irv Haas ""dvdirv""",R139HO8WM5NEV2,3,"The Motorola Triumph is a feature-laden phone that has some problems that need to be addressed.For standard voice features, this phone performs solidly. Audio is clear and it is easy to make and receive calls. Using other features of this phone left me disappointed. The Internet worked as advertised, however the GPS functionality took too long to search for destinations.The touchpad was quite sensitive and worked very well. The large 4.1"" LCD screen made it easy to view, although the display has a slighly bluish cast.My biggest disappointment with this phone was its Bluetooth functionality. The phone paired and connected with my 2 devices and then lost the signal within 20-30 minutes. I tried repeatedly to re-pair and connect this phone and it it would always hang up. Reading on the Internet, I discovered that many others had this same problem. I even contacted Motorola to see if they had a firmware update or fix for the Bluetooth problem. They refused to acknowledge that this problem even existed. Motorola told me to do a hard reset of the phone and other devices in order to make it work. In a last ditch effort, I suggested that Motorola report this problem to upper management in order to fix the problem. I never heard back about a solution. Since Google has bought out Motorola Mobility, they were not all that concerned for fixing this problem. As a result, I bought a phone from htc and my Bluetooth problem was ""fixed.""If you are looking for a fully-featured Android phone without a contract, the Motorola Triumph would be one to consider.

mobile phone,Died after one month,old mojo,R16K90AWMWN6DX,3,"we bought two of these phones. One was bought awhile back, and the other around the end of January. The first one bought has been working great with no issues or problems at all and very happy with it. The second one died after just over a month of use. While in the middle of texting, the screen had a vertical line go down it and poof...dead. Called up Motorola tech support and they had us do a hard reset with no luck, and then had us change out the battery with the other Triumph, and still no luck. Going thru Motorola, we were going to have to send the phone back to them, have it fixed, then it would be sent back...and we would have to pay for the shipping to Motorola. We use the phones for Virgin Mobile, so we called Virgin and told them what happened and what we did with tech support with Motorola. They quickly set us up with a new phone being shipped out free thru FedEx, and with a return label to send the defective phone back for free. Pretty impressed about that with Virgin. Sux that the phone died so fast tho. Also, it seems the battery doesn't last quite as long as expected, but was still pretty good.

mobile phone,Disappointing,"Mac McCall ""-dmd-""",R3OY6ZGPOQD1RX,3,"I have long been a fan of Virgin Mobile's Beyond Talk plan. I previously had their LG Optimus V Android phone which I like just fine with the exception that my hands are too big for the keyboard.So, I ordered the Motorola Triumph from Amazon hoping that it would have exactly the same functionality as the Optimus and a larger screen.Indeed, the screen was larger and the keyboard worked just fine. I was delighted.Unfortunately, after the phone was activated, the problems arose. Most damning were the fact that I had zero bars in my office and the 3G would not connect. With the Optimus, I had 2-3 bars and a weak, albeit usable 3G signal.To add insult to injury, the Optimus provided me with a wi-fi hotspot which I admittedly used very sparingly, but it was nice to be able to update map on the Xoom while traveling. The wi-fi hotspot did not work with the Triumph. This alone was not a show stopper but considered along with the weak reception became deal breaker.I readily admit that I could have received a phone that for some reason did not receive as well as it should have, but the idea of returning it and trying another was not appealing, so I simply returned it.I'm back using the Optimus (which is smaller and easier to carry) but with limited typing ability.I think the major point though is that Virgin Mobile has enough sense to sell their phones and then offer no-contract service. If you are looking for decent service at a great price then I highly recommend you look at Virgin Mobile's Beyond Talk. If you are in a better coverage area, the Triumph may well be a great solution for you. Smaller hands would also do well with the Optimus V.","January 7, 2012",0

mobile phone,Ok Data phone if you can deal with the annoyances,K. Cone,R19CWFCK95Z6ET,3,"The last phone I had was a Samsung Intercept. I thought I would step up to the Triumph so bought one in December of 2011 through VM. At first it worked great - I installed a 16gb micro SD card and downloaded a few apps from the Google app store. I'm not an app freak, I don't care to use my phone as something to keep me constantly occupied, I use it primarily for texting, GPS navigation and a few word games. I don't even have Angry Birds.For the first 4 months it seemed to work well, no complaints. After that I noticed the occasional self-reboot about every two weeks. Now, it self-reboots about every three days. It causes certain apps to then run which were previously off. I thought maybe certain apps triggered this but after a combination of different circumstances around which the phone would reset, I don't think it's any of the apps I installed (no third-party, btw). If I don't turn off the apps, my battery will drain. The problem is the phone has rebooted when I'm not around.Navigator now takes much longer to find a satellite and sometimes the app just gets stuck - I have to exit and restart and then it seems to work fine (it would be stuck for up to 5 minutes, after which I would reset since I'm not going to wait any longer). Occasionally I would lose the signal while driving and Navigator refused to work for what it seemed several minutes or more (at this point I would use my Tom Tom which had no issues getting satellites).While watching Nexflix (phone in landscape position) I usually accidentally hit the power button since it's opposite the volume controls.The phone seems unstable and I'm reading a lot about people being frustrated with it. Some have suggested bad or corrupt hardware/memory. I've read about scanning for this and fixes, but this is more than what a VM customer should have to do to fix what seems a known issue.I wouldn't recommend this phone to a friend. I can usually deal with not-so-great technology if it's cheap. I paid $200 for the phone at the time and am on the $25 a month plan. ICS is not available for this through VM.Also, the phone already has a very thick screen protector on it when you buy it. I peeled mine off for a more responsive screen.","October 19, 2012",0

mobile phone,Some Good Some Bad....Beware,J. Hahn,RGRW3T8BERJKZ,3,"I have now owned Virgin Mobile's top-of-the-line Android for approximately 8 months now. While I was extremely happy with the phone initially, I have unfortunately since changed my tune.Let me just start by stating right off the bat I have had to send it back for a replacement, TWICE. The biggest problem I had the first few months of having this phone was it's annoying habit of constantly turning itself off. One day it turned itself off, and wouldn't turn back on. To make matters worse, when I called to get a replacement, they insisted on sending me a battery instead of an actual phone. I was skeptical it would work....I was right. The battery was indeed a failure and so I had to wait nearly a week for a replacement phone. In all, I was without a phone for nearly two weeks. Totally unacceptable.It's good to also keep in mind that the Triumph runs on Android version 2.2 AKA Froyo. It works fine, and I have no major complains BUT in a world where Ginger Bread and most recently Ice Cream Sandwich are commonplace, it can feel a little dated. I have asked a number of times of the Triumph will ever get a proper OS update, but have never been given a straight answer.I will say that the replacement phone cured it's bad habit of turning itself off all the time. Unfortunately, fast forward to about a week ago, and I found myself needing yet another replacement phone. This time it was the screen. It was inexplicably turning very dark to the point where you could barely see what was on the screen. Also, lines and distortions would show up. If I gave the back of the phone a couple of taps, this would correct the problem. But alas, it started to happen with much more frequency.After all this you might be wondering why I am giving it a 3 Star Rating. Well, in all honesty, it isn't ALL bad.The biggest draw to this device is that if you want a nice Android with a big screen from the No Contract/Pre-Pay market, the Triumph is one of your few options. Virgin's pricing is also appealing. $55 bucks a month gets you all-you-can-eat minutes, texting, and data. But be warned: As of last month, Virgin announced that the unlimited data (The unlimited minutes and texting still stand.) isn't so unlimited. After 4 or 5 gigs, they will start to throttle you. I also have to say that call quality is pretty solid. The ear speaker is quite loud and I rarely have problems hearing anyone. The same can be said for the mic. I have been told many times that I sound loud and clear on the other end, even when bars are low. Also, the 3G is perfectly snappy. Most web pages, even ones loaded with video and content, load within 10-30 seconds. Not bad at all in my opinion. The 4.1 inch screen is handsome, big, and bright. Perfect for web surfing and watching video. The speakers are also pretty good. Like most smartphones, they can be a bit tinny, but they get quite loud. Videos and music are actually a pleasure to listen to, as well as watch.At the end of the day, I can really only recommend this phone to someone who REALLY wants a ""proper"" smartphone from a No Contract/Pre-Pay company. All the rest of you....beware.","May 27, 2012",0
mobile phone,Ongoing bluetooth issues,Sue H,RMD1E4DY59M7D,3,"I have a big problem with my Motorola Triumph. Before purchasing it I did the research and found that some people have had issues with the Bluetooth. I went ahead and bought it anyway, figuring that it's not the same for everyone and hopefully I would not have any problems.Wrong! The first one would not connect at all, to any Bluetooth device and was returned. The replacement phone connects just as it should, but then disconnects after 20 or 30 minutes. The only way I have found to reconnect is to go into the phone settings, turn off the Bluetooth, turn it back on and go through the reconnection process again. That's an annoying fault at anytime. For me however, it is way beyond just being 'annoying'. I drive a tour coach and, because we can only use a cell phone if it is hands free, I need the Bluetooth capability to work correctly for more than a half hour at a time. With my previous carrier I had an Optimus V and never had a problem with it.I love everything else about the Triumph and if it were not for this problem I would have rated it at five stars. I really do not want to switch to a different phone. It would be a shame if I have to do that, but I am fast approaching the point that I will seriously consider it my only remaining option.","April 29, 2012",0
mobile phone,Just Okay.,"L. Carr ""ComputerGuy""",R3H7ENMFDRG7QE,3,"Bought the phone from BB on first day it was available. Charged battery overnight. Noticed right away that received signal level was 10dBm down from my Optimus V. Wifi easy setup and fast. Youtube videos look fine, but the screen is washed out if viewed from any angle other that straight on. Colors faded and not as vivid as my Optimus. Signal weak compared to my Optimus and not able to sync 3G. Stayed in 1x the entire time I used it at the house. GPS took at least five minutes to lock on sat first time. It was faster later if you are in same place. But move to a different location and it will take a long time to lock. Just could not live with the weaker signal so I took it back to BB. They did not have any more in stock so I just got my money back. Overall I can only give it 3 stars because of the lack of a signal. Side by side with my Optimus it was consistently 10dBm weaker signal. I was going to get another one now that BB has them in stock again, but many other users reporting same problem with antenna. Waiting on Optimus Black in December.","July 28, 2011",0
mobile phone,Power hog,Tim Garber,RZRYVSHU0RE41,3,"PROS: Faster processing and more Internal storage than Virgin's other options.CONS: Is nearly worthless on battery power.I upgraded from an LG Optimus V and I am happy with the added internal memory. The speed is slightly better, however power consumption is a real problem. Nothing running except My Tracks, and the power drops at a rate of 17% per hour. The Optimus saw only see an 8% drop in a side by side comparison. Yesterday I needed it for a 10 hour trip where recharging was not an option. I shut everything down except basic phone and only use the phone a total of 15 minutes. At the end of the day I had 6% left.Unacceptable. I'm considering going back to the memory-starved Optimus V.

mobile phone,Triumph fails to Activate: MEID not registered with Virgin Mobil USA,"Amazon Customer ""Liam Case""",R2B4RMBYL3G5RD,3,"Updated:I did get a refund. And I did resolve this problem was due to Virgin Mobile not the seller. I did cancel all my phones with Virgin because of their failure. The seller was not at fault. I thought this had been updated but discovered this still needed to be updated. As for the MOT phone, I do not know if it was good or great but now have Samsung Note 2 that I love.Old:Product is not registered within the Virgin Mobile USA MEID registry as a valid product serial number. It can take an act of god to get the phone activated. In order to activate the product, you must unpack and assemble the unit by installing the lithium battery then charging it. This voids the Amazon refund policy as the product is now used not new. But this would also mean it is defective. Product support and custormer service are not on the same page and the shipping vendor my be selling products they know will not activate. To get an RMA or a refund can take 4-8 weeks if at all. This is a do not buy from third parties. I am not sure I would recommend Virgin Mobile online store. It is still being escallated to the ""headquarters"" in New Jersey.

mobile phone,Beware of the nexus promise,Adam Smith,R2O6G2DI3B72LS,3,"First, I should mention I love my phone, I still have my Nexus One and I love it even tough I recognize its limitations. However I needed a second phone and I don't like customized android versions (had Motorola's and Samsung Galaxy S and different tablets), so I knew the Galaxy Nexus would be a perfect fit.As a phone it doesn't dissapoint, it is fast and easy to use. Features were improved in different areas and it feels very snappy. However, I bought it mainly to have my phone updated to Jelly Bean when it arrived, as I thought was implicit in Nexus phones...I was wrong, I realized now there are different versions of Galaxy Nexus, and not all of them receive updates from Google, and as I understand there are two variants still not getting Jelly Bean, Verizon and international versions (yakjuxw, as my phone, bought here in Amazon) haven't.I didn't know that since I bought it before Jelly Bean release and had already 4.0.4, and now I found myself pressing the 'check for updates' button too many times, no luck.--- UPDATE 2012/09/04Just got an e-mail from Samsung support, currently there's no official release date for that firmware version for Galaxy Nexus.--- UPDATE 2012/09/07Oh no! phone was working fine until noon yesterday and then lost the network signal! baseband version and IMEI unknown... problem persists after wiping and reseting and changing chips... so the nightmare begins...--- UPDATE 2012/09/12 - DEADAfter talking to US Samsung Support they failed to register the phone in their system since it seems it's an international version, they forwarded me to Samsung Canada (still don't know why) and they couldn't help me either (They don't even see my ticket number!).

mobile phone,Still has plenty of rough edges,Ksusha,R2FPS3HS418G9M,3,"I had high expectations for this phone, but I must say I was pretty disappointed.There are plenty of rough edges still left and as such if you want a totally polished experience, this is not the phone for you (I'd go for iPhone myself if not for the totally closed nature of that platform). All things I expect to be present like seamless backups (and restores), multicalendar sync, sensible defaults are just not there. Occasional UI stuttering is still there too, as are random hangs and reboots.More advanced things like full disk encryption are also pretty bad and it looks like nobody actually tested how they really work (reboot into a blank screen and you need to press power button to get to the ""enter password"" prompt, really? No way to have separate encryption and unlock passwords).Physical appearance is also questionable. Power is on the side and is pretty sensitive as are the volume buttons, so it's all too easy accidentally pressing them in the middle of something. No hardware mute button is really inconvenient when you need to fast and covertly turn off sound (e.g. at customs area at an airport where otherwise they might easily confiscate your phone if you are caught ""using"" it). Headphone jack at the bottom of the device means if you store your phone in a front shirt pocket, it must be upside-down when you listen to music on it (or even just talk).No separate memory for volume levels with and without headphone attached means you can accidentally deafen yourself if you forget to reduce the volume after connecting a headphone.Of course all of the above are not total show-stopper and the phone is still usable, it's also a clear step up from previous Android versions, but the price being charged for this is totally unjustifiable. I would understand if it was $300 phone (with no contract, or free with contract), but not at $600 unlocked ($100 with 2 year contract at verizon on the other hand does make some sense).","March 10, 2012",0

mobile phone,More effort required.,CT,R1ZZ2MG6ZGWCEO,3,"I ordered this off amazon, tax free, with two day shipping. Arrived in a timely manner, but just got to activate it this morning. Activation is very simple. The kit includes a sim card, which you just insert above (and to the left) of the battery in the back. Then you will want to go to t-mobile.com/activation and follow the instructions. It comes with a random $3.34 balance.. for emergency.. instant calling or something I suppose. But following the activation, it takes you to where you can pay for your service online. You can also get those cards at the store, but honestly, it's so easy just to pay online. And then you're good to go. I chose the $30 unlim text/data + 100 min plan. You don't need to go to walmart or tmobile to get this. To my understanding, it is only available for new activations.The price and quality of the phone is all great. One problem I have with it is that... honestly... I'm not really an Android fan. I didn't think I would mind it at all but somehow it really annoys me how much bloatware it comes with. Sure, there are ways to delete it. But people on reviews made it sound 100x easier than what I had to do. I don't really consider myself technologically challenged, but it was hard to find all the steps to uninstall this crap I didn't want. You can't just go to the ""APPLICATIONS"" menu and drag what you don't want to the trash. Why? Everything I've tried to delete just stays there when I go back to the menu. What the hell is that function for then? Why can I not just delete the stuff I don't want? (And there are many.)I'm new to Android so rooting was a brand new concept for me. I must have downloaded 4 different apps off the Android market to no avail. I didn't understand why the hell something called ""______ Uninstaller"" cannot uninstall apps. After a bit of research and trying a bunch of different things, I finally figured it out.I figure I'd type it out in layman's terms for those who have trouble rooting:- Turn on USB debugger (settings>applications>development>usb debugging)- Have the right USB drivers installed ON YOUR COMPUTER (Apparently these are difficult to find. Install the samsung galaxy x drivers from softpedia instead. When I did this, it told me it wasn't installed correctly but I couldn't find a fix so I just ignored it.)- Connect your phone to the computer via usb port- Then you can download SuperOneClick on your COMPUTER. It is a computer application. Extract (it is a zip file) and run. Click on ""root."" (top left big button) It may take a couple minutes. It should say root complete or whatever at the end. And to confirm that it is indeed rooted, you will see a ""Superuser"" icon in the applications folder.- Now you can begin the uninstallation, but that is not all! You have to download some more stuff to uninstall. From the Android market, you can find some apps that will allow you to uninstall items. Android Mate was too advanced for me. You have to know exactly what files you are deleting (which is a constant annoyance.) If you delete the wrong files then your phone might not work or it will brick. Kind of terrifying, considering the price I paid. I used Titanium backup to uninstall items, but you still run the risk of deleting things you need. It is better to ""freeze"" the apps but that is a premium feature, which you must pay for. I also tried Root Uninstaller to no avail. It didn't show any apps besides Market and itself for some reason. I'm sure there's something out there that might be better but, so far, my experience is that these apps are not that user-friendly.Others have claimed that the process above is ""easy"" but it wasn't for me, apparently. Maybe some people know how to do this intuitively, I don't know. But think about it. All I wanted to do was delete pre-installed junk like internet radios and ""MORE FREE APPS!@!!"" apps. But it took entirely way too long. You can just press on any app in iOS until it's shaking and then press X to delete. A couple seconds, max. I don't understand why it is so hard to delete things on the Android (not even including the risk of bricking your phone at every corner.)Aside from my long rant, in the end, it is a good deal for a 4g smartphone and great rates on plans. Still, I'm not too satisfied with Android. I feel like it's one of those apple vs. windows commercials, comparing efficiency. There's a pre-installed anti-virus (free trial for 14 days, then you have to pay). Really? I never even thought that would be an issue with iOS. Obviously these are my opinions, and others will have no problems with the bloatware. I'm a bit OCD and inefficiency is such an annoyance. I just want my phone to run as efficiently and quickly as possible, not having junk on it that tries to make me install more apps or pay for premium services. Yes, the iphone costs way more, but I would still rather have it than Android. That's just me though.EDIT:After a few days of use, I'm getting used to the Android system more. I don't mind it as much, and hopefully it will hold up well. It's still a fantastic deal, and with no contracts none-the-less! In the end, the savings are fantastic. Think about the activation fees and taxes and whatnot when you have to get a phone with a contract. This phone is really a smart purchase.","January 7, 2012",0
mobile phone,Great Phone; but cannot move any application to external SD card,Larry,R1VAZDE2SWEWZA,3,"This is a great phone. Good resolution and great features. However, it does not have one important feature that I thought all new Andorid phones had. That is the ability to move applications to the external SD card. It takes a 32 GB card, which I installed immediately. However, when you move an application to the SD card it moves it to the internal SD partition. I called Samsung as I expected that this was a fault with the phone, but they said that this is designed into all phones that have internal SD partitations, including the Galaxy S and Galaxy IIS. In other words, all of the higher end Samsung Androids have this internal SD (called USB) and all have this problem. And the internal SD on the phone is quite small, only 1.62 GB; and the internal phone memory is only 1 GB. So the only use of the external card is to store MP3 files and you can set the camera to use the external SD card.I tried every way possible to get around this, but to no avail. I even tried using the ADB program in the software development kit to set the default installation location (it is normally 0 for automaic; 2 is external SD). But even here it sees the SD as the internal SD and not the external one. This may be a deal breaker for me because one of the things I wanted was to store my Audible books on the SD card, but they will not be recognized by the program if they are moved there as they always are only recognized in the default installation location of the program. And the media scaner that is used for MP3 files will not pick them up. Also wanted to install birder applications that allow you to add your own pictures. But the same problem.","February 22, 2012",0
mobile phone,"Best prepaid deal for 4g, but phone is not that great",Nick,RA749LKQRHPI6,3,"you don't need to sign a contract to get it. 4G phones are still the newest and most expensive. T-Mobile really went above and beyond and I'm really happy that AT&T;, the greed machine, wasn't allowed to take over the company, otherwise this phone would be $600 without a contract and I'd be paying $120 a month for the same plan of unlimited internet including 5gb of unrestricted 4G speeds, and after that you get I'm guessing 3g but I haven't exceeded the quota. 5gb is A LOT of web surfing. AT&T; and Verizon won't even sell you 4G prepaid, unless you sign a juicy contract for them and they'll still cap you at about 2gb.The small caveat is that you only get 4gb of internal memory which you can expand to 32gb with a sdhc card. But this phone even plays netflix.My plan is the 100 minutes and Unlimited internet from Walmart for 30 bucks. Additional minutes are 10c. Compare that to the 40c an extra minute that ATT charges you. Update : tmobile has the strongest signal i have seen. I even get 4g reception in my lower level apartment garage and in 95% of my city and surrounding cities. Att, straight Talk and virgin Mobile could never get reception in my garageUpdate: it took only ONE fall from my pocket and it cracked the screen. One, and it wasn't even that dramatic of a fall. Really poor quality there. Also, it's starting to slow down way too much. However, the 4g signal is fast and strong still. I guess I got what I pad for at $200.

Compared to the $90 with my contract phone this is great! Unfortunately, the phone is rubbish compared to my previous HTC HD7. I try and keep my patience and remind myself of the savings but popping my battery out to restart my phone because it freezes several times a day gets extremely old. I have downloaded just a few apps such as Words with Friends, Draw Something, Fruit Ninja, and a couple others. They all run fine but when I just want to put my password in to access my phone there is some serious lag. There is also a bunch of preloaded apps that I will never use that you cannot delete.

With my iphone I never had this issue.There have been some glitches, not sure if it's just ""my"" phone but I have to press the ""power on"" button (sometimes 10-15 seconds, just pressing) for it to finally turn on .

mobile phone,"An OK Phone, but more than a few flaws make it less than perfect",UncleTed,R1KA7RAE8GI4CN,3,"Let me start this review my saying that I came from an old iPhone 3GS. While I enjoy the hardware and software quality of my Apple product, I did not at all enjoy the long-term expensive contract that came with it. I'm usually around areas with WiFi, so paying each month for a required data package didn't make much sense to me. I wanted a phone and carrier plan that met my needs, not the other way around.When my two-year contract expired I began researching various phones and carrier plans. I wanted a smartphone (Apple spoiled me there), but it didn't have to have all the bells and whistles. I mostly wanted something that could play music while on road trips and allow me to reliably call and text my buddies. The Exhibit II was the phone that seemed to meet all my needs.After owning the phone for a month I can say that it does a fairly decent job at meeting my needs. However, there are a number of flaws in the phone that make using it quirky and often irritating. Below are my general pro/con thoughts on the phone.Pros:The screen is noticeably brighter and of higher quality than my old iPhone. Everything looks crisp and detailed.The Exhibit II is a good bit lighter and less bulky than my iPhone. It feels much more at home in my pocket.I save $40 a month in comparison to my old AT&T; bill. The phone will pay for itself in just five months.Flaws:The touchscreen is flat out not as responsive as my iPhone 3GS. I often have to touch or drag multiple times in order to get input to be registered. I get the impression that it is less a flaw of the touchscreen than the processor in the phone trying to keep up with my actions, for it feels somewhat laggy. With a 1GHz Snapdragon, however, I didn't expect such sluggishness.There is something wrong with the volume control when I attempt to make calls. If I toggle the volume up, nothing will happen. I discovered, with some experimentation, that I first have to press the volume control down before I can press it up to make it louder. This is very counter-intuitive and, frankly, annoying.There is a loud pop though the earpiece a few seconds after I press 'Send' to make a call. I have to hold the phone away from my ear to save my eardrums some pain.This phone has a good bit of bloatware installed. I thought Apple exercised tight control over their users, but I can't even delete the useless junk on my Exhibit II!3D games don't run all that well. Even simpler games such as Temple Run exhibit enough lag to stymie your gameplay experience.There is a significant delay between when I press the button to take a photograph and when that photograph is actually taken. The delay can be anywhere between one and four seconds. This is a major issue if you are tying to take a photograph in a pinch. More often than not you will miss that special moment.This isn't really a flaw in the phone itself, but I don't get very good service where I live. The TMobile map showed that I was in a lighter green, but I get more dropped calls and interference than what I did with AT&T.;The Samsung Exhibit II runs an older version of the Andriod OS (Gingerbread), and it doesn't look like TMobile has plans to update the phone to Ice Cream Sandwich.The TMoible MyAccount Software will not work unless 'Use Packet Data' is enabled under 'Settings -> Wireless and network -> Mobile networks.' I generally keep Packet Data off so that I do not accidentally use data while out and about. It is annoying that I first must enable this to see how I am doing in terms of my minutes and text messages.Text messages occasionally fail to send. I sometimes have to attempt the send multiple times before it will go through.Other thoughts:This is just personal opinion, but Andriod feels much less polished than iOS. With my iPhone I never worried about restarting my device to keep it running well. My Exhibit II, on the other hand, reminds me every week or two that it is time to reboot the phone so that it can continue operating properly.Malware seems to be fairly rampant on the Andriod platform. I cringe at the thought of Malware getting on a heavy communication device such as my phone.Setting up my phone wasn't as smooth as I would like it to have been. I attempted to perform the setup through the TMobile web portal, but I continually got a message partway through stating that my account was 'processing' and that I should wait. After a couple days of waiting I called TMobile and painlessly set up my account through one of their agents.Conclusion:This is a decent phone if all you are looking to do is make a few calls, play music, and perhaps do minimal web browsing. If you are a heavy cell phone user and are looking for a phone that will play the latest games, text, run the latest software, and do heavy multimedia, then I recommend looking elsewhere.","May 20, 2012",0

It is choked with bloatware and the memory allocation system in operating system Jellybean 2.3 is too inefficient to juggle all the processes that normal use starts up. I grew to HATE this phone because it was so frustrating to use. My iPhone-using sister stared at me in disbelief when I showed her how it operates stock.Since I was so frustrated with this phone, I took the plunge and learned how to get root access and installed the Gingerbread 3.0 operating system and WOW... what a difference!

It's like a new device and a joy to use.The different flavors of operating systems for the phone are available here: http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=2037654I'm running RebelROM 3.1 (a variant of Sony's Experia system), and I love it, but I think I'm going to try out some of the 4.2 editions now that I know the process to flash the ROM.For the price, this device has good value for people who don't mind installing new software.By the way, the process to change the operating system (back up your contacts, music, photos, etc... first!) is like this:1) Copy ClockworkMod 6 to the internal phone SD storage via a micro USB cable2) Copy your target OS to the internal phone storage or an external Micro SD card.3) Reboot the phone into Recovery Mode4) Run Backup from within ClockworkMod5) Select Wipe/Factory Reset6) Select Install ROM7) Reboot and enjoy your new phone!There are more detailed instructions at the XDA website, but that is a rough outline of the process.Overall, I'm happy with my smartphone now that all the bloatware is gone and an updated operating system is running on it.","May 31, 2013",0

mobile phone,"Not a great phone, but a cheap path to smartphonedom.","Gerard Dreiss ""Gojulas""",R1D82L6DN5OLYL,3,"I got this phone knowing from reading the reviews that it was not that great, but at least it was affordable. I've had it for a few months now and can say that for the most part it is fine. I'm basically going to rehash what everyone else has said, but here it goes:- Slow: Surfing the web, switching apps, swiping from screen to screen can be very slow.- Battery Life: With just moderate use the battery still runs down in less than a day.- Camera: actually not that bad, even if the resolution is low and don't even think of using it in dim lighting.- Bloatware: yeah, it's annoying, and you can't get rid of it!- Random Reboots: super annoying, and happens at least once a week. I've had lockups too.Even with all that I'm not sorry I got this phone. I'm on the super cheap $30 Walmart plan. I can surf the web, watch Netflix at lunch, listen to Pandora on the commute, and generally stay connected, all without breaking the bank. Not a bad phone.

mobile phone,"Good for the price, but it may not fit your needs",Alexander Wilke,R39WN7DCAQ3DSI,3,"I made the switch to T-Mobile about 4 months ago and I'm pleased with the service and especially the cost of the service. I didn't want to buy the top-of-the-line phone either since I was trying to save money and this looked like a good entry-level phone. I would say I think I got the best phone for the price, but in retrospect I think I would've been happier getting something slightly more powerful.One thing I am very pleased about is the ease of modding this phone. I knew I had to get away from the TouchWiz interface and I wanted something newer than Gingerbread as well. It took me a while to find the right set of instructions for rooting the phone, but once it was finally done I was just shocked at how simple it was. With my last two HTC phones there was always some complicated unlocking process involving drivers and installing the Android SDK and such. With this one I really only had to download a few files, put them on my SD card, reboot into recovery and flash them. Easy! The phone may actually run smoother on Gingerbread, but there were some JellyBean features and apps I just had to have. So when I mention the performance just bear in mind I'm not running stock Android.The performance is probably the most disappointing thing about this phone. It only has a 1Ghz single-core processor and 512MB of RAM. It's fine for most apps, but some visually strenuous games or ""fully featured"" apps will make the phone choke. I'm not a big phone gamer so it's not a big deal for me, but when I hear about a cool game it's frustrating when I can't even try it. I think the RAM is the most limiting factor of the phone though. I usually run Tasker on my phones but not on this one. I figure it would choke even more often if it was running since some apps have a tough time running after a fresh reboot. The most frustrating thing about the poor performance is when I'm playing music into my stereo over bluetooth. I get a lot of skipping and pausing in songs when my phone is choking up. Still, you may have none of these issues depending on your phone usage.One thing that is also an annoyance, and I think this is common for Samsung phones, is that there are three storage areas on the phone: Internal, SD, and External SD. I imagine the first two are actually the same chip, they've just been split up, and the third is the removable SD card. This is an annoyance because essentially nothing gets stored on the External SD [by default]. Using the app manager to move apps to the SD card is useless. It just moves them from Internal memory to the Internal SD memory. Unless your app can be configured to store data on the External SD card you'll have to manually move items to the External SD (pictures and videos, not apps), pull some storage tricks with root access, or just deal with the limited space. This is one thing I definitely miss about my HTC phones.A couple things I also really miss, and this is mainly a consequence of trying to save money by getting a low-end smartphone, are the notification LED and the light sensor. Other than auditory queues I really don't know when I get a notification unless I check my phone. I've heard some apps can make the soft keys flash for notifications but that sounded like a really sad replacement. Considering there's a front-facing camera I was really surprised that there's no light sensor (I would've preferred the latter over the former). There is also an app that can use the brightness from the camera to adjust the screen brightness, but it wasn't very consistent.I think the USB port is in an inconvenient spot as well (on the top of the phone). It makes the cord get in my way much more when I try to use it while it's plugged in. One nice thing about running a custom ROM is the ability to flip the screen 180 degrees.I never really had a phone with a good camera, but this one is definitely grainy. Really, unless you're outdoors or in a very bright room the LED doesn't help that much. Speaking of the LED, I've only found one app that was able to turn on the LED as a flashlight. My beloved Tesla LED app just didn't do it.Overall I like the phone, obviously there were things that had to be left out and corners that needed to be cut to keep the price low, but it's a good phone for what you pay. Some of the complaints I had were simply design or implementation choices, but if you're willing to pay a bit more I think you can avoid the performance issues and lack of common Android features.","June 14, 2013",0
mobile phone,take this phone with a grain of salt,Aaron,R2GLSJTUYZMSJG,3,"The bloatware on this phone drastically slows down performance. It lags when changing applications. It's embarrassing when my friends with iPhones are Googling or finding their way with their GPSes so much faster than me. It lagged when I needed it most. It power cycled at bad times. I suffered for about 3 months like this.Then I rooted it and installed Rebelrom 3.09 on it. Now it runs faster and smoother. DISCLAIMER: this voids your warranty and takes a bit of digging around to get it working right.. I was careful in installing it. I considered cyanogenmod but I wanted my camera and emergency calling to work. Now my phone looks better and does not lag as much when switching between applications. Rebelrom is lightweight compared to stock OSOTHER THINGS:The earpiece is quiet. I had trouble hearing people in my car before. But I've learned how to position it on my ear to get the best sound out of it. In quiet areas it's fine.3d games are mostly not playable. I've played simple games like zynga poker and words on this phone. It works great for simple things like that.the screen is fine for reading text, I read a lot of news and journal articles online. It gets a bit washed out in the sunlight but I don't do my heavy reading in the sunlight.The power button is difficult to press without a cover on it. I got this one (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B006ECAMY2/ref=oh_details_o03_s00_i00) and it works great. The speaker feels tinny. The camera is ok. I take pictures in bright light and take pictures of my food. This is a baby point and shoot. I'm not a pro or anything, but I know that this camera is not as great as some other reviews put it up to be.I expected this phone to be the best bang for my buck out of the box. But I spend several hours rooting and flashing a new ROM on it for it to work to my satisfaction (I'm new to Android mods).","November 22, 2012",0
mobile phone,Was good at first!,Meg,R27067RKIOW7CU,3,"I have had this phone for 7 months and this is actually my 2nd one like this. The problem with my first phone was my fault lol my daughter had got a hold to it. My 2nd phone was doing very good at first and I was in love with this phone. It's just a smaller version of the galaxy. Pros: easy to use, front facing camera allowing video chat, small (for my hands)4g works pretty good Cons: front facing camera does not take good pics at all, comes with a bunch of apps that you probably won't use and you can't get rid of them,screen sometimes slow to respond, and you have to hold down the power button for 10-15 sec for it to come on. I initially liked the phone at 1st until I started experiencing very irritating problems. One day my phone would not charge for some reason. It decided it would start back charging a few hours later. But the most FRUSTRATING problem I have experienced is it keeps charging and discharging over and over again. It keeps blinking and vibrating non stop. The only time when it doesn't do it is when it is plugged into the charger. It may be a problem with the battery but I'm not sure but I will be replacing the battery soon. It stopped doing the charging and discharging at the moment. Also when I took the battery out and placed it back it in and then tried to turn the phone on a battery icon popped up. The phone would not turn on until I connected it to the charger. I have also read about of people having the same problem with charging and discharging problem. I will be keeping the phone for right now and see what it does when I get the new battery but I am looking for something much better! I'm not going to tell you not to buy this phone but purchase at your OWN risk. Overall o.k phone but definitely will not buy again and don't recommend.","August 30, 2012",0

Just kidding, that would be outrageous and very difficult. I do use it for navigation, Pandora, Instagram, Hill Climb Racing, internet, texting, calling, and general jagaloonery. The camera isn't bad. I do wish it had an auto dimming/brightening feature for the screen, but just download a widget that lets you adjust it and you're fine. I don't understand why you have to press ""OK"" after entering your PIN to unlock it, but whatever. Oh also it's a great compact size. Fits well in the pocket. The vibrator sucks. I never feel it vibrate. Oh and a couple times the clock was off by a couple hours and my alarm didn't go off. It's an adventure, this phone. You never know what's going to happen. It's like oh hey let me call Janice and you press the numbers and hit dial and you don't know if it's going to call Janice right away, 2 minutes from now, or never! hahahaha!!!! I will say it's better than an iPhone in that if someone stole my friend's iPhone and smashed it with a hammer he would be heart broken that he lost all that money, whereas if a hooligan snatched my Samsung Galaxy Exhibit 4G from me and smashed it with a hammer I would just laugh and then by like 3 more of these for the price of an iPhone.

I will say that if you don't have patience, don't buy this phone. It will test your patience on numerous occasions. For one, the memory is terrible. After about eight months into the phone, I have no memory what so ever to listen to music & take photos/look through photos. It glitches a lot. With incoming phone calls the screen will be black for a few seconds THEN will show the call screen, whereas on better smart phones the call will automatically show up. Loading applications takes a little longer than desired. I've tried applications in which that would help speed up the phone, but there's only so much you can do. Sometimes, if the phone is overwhelmed by so much, it just reboots itself. The battery, over time, will go on you, especially if you use a lot of applications. I would suggest to constantly have a charger handy. I mean, for a person that needs a phone with basic smart phone capabilities for cheap, this is okay. However, I have learned my lesson not to be cheap with my cell phones. I'll be sure to save up & look at higher end models for now on. Good luck with this phone.","September 18, 2013",0

mobile phone,Data works IF you are in T-Mobile network.,JohnDoe,R178C2XYQRGLES,3,"Just got this phone with unlimited data/text/100min.

BTW the phone works perfectly well with AT&T; - a rare feature available on this phone, it covers both AT&T; and T-mobile data frequencies. My main need is to forward business voice mail from email to phone MMS. I tried AT&T; (after unlocking). But AT&T; plays tricks. It does not permit WAV sound files to be sent by email - they simply delete the email. Even mp3 files are striped off the message. Nowhere does AT&T; state this before service purchase.

mobile phone,"Its okay, but its no iPhone","E.

I'm still giving this phone 3 stars because its probably a good smartphone if not compared to the iPhone. I can get used to the Android interface and structure - that's not the issue. My quarrel with this phone is perhaps not even with the hardware, rather with it's Android OS deployment. The issue is that of stability. In less than one week of ownership I have had to reboot it numerous times, had multiple occasions of an applications responding VERY slowly and have seen some odd behavior such as text messages forwarded to multiple email boxes without solicitation.I'm hoping that all these issues will get resolved via firmware/OS updates.

mobile phone,It was great for about six months,K. P. Keber,R27U73SILJUZD1,3,"Pros: affordable; great intro to Android (Gingerbread, no higher); pretty sturdy with a case; slide-out keyboard; tough glass screen; takes surprisingly good pictures and videos (NOT HD); nice rounded corner design; good voice quality on calls; so-so music playing qualityCons: Weak processor; slow processor; minuscule internal storage capacity; minuscule RAM; slow access to storage card; spontaneous reboots (especially when running processor-intensive tasks like workout-fitness programs); tiny screen; incompatible with many modern Android apps; short battery life when running all the stuff (Wifi, GPS, apps, etc.); videos barely tolerableDid I mention how slow and weak the processor is and how it reboots spontaneously?Okay, so I got this about 11 months ago as of this writing. My first smartphone. Even then the screen looked small, but that was easy to forgive because, you know: *smartphone*! I set about learning all the things it could do, transferring all my contactsâ€” manuallyâ€” from my feature phone. I looked into anti-virus and other geeky stuff like file management apps. I got a 32 GB micro SD card, took pictures and videos and generally used it a lot. I totally quit using the slide out keyboard when I downloaded and then bought SwiftKey because it anticipates my typing needs so uncannily well (I'll plug SwiftKey here because it really is almost spooky how well it knows *exactly* what I want to say when I'm typing. I almost prefer it to typing on my terrific Logitech K750 keyboard. I'm just a SwiftKey customer, no other connection).One of the things I was most excited about was apps that could record my walks using the phone's GPS receiver. You plug in your personal info (age, weight, etc) and go work out. It maps out your route, including elevation changes. It figures distance covered, pace, mph/kph, calories burned and a lot more. It's terrific for cardiac cases.BUT it is a processor-intensive app. From the very first fitness app I triedâ€” and I've tried severalâ€” the phone would run it for a while and then spontaneously reboot itself, right in the middle of a hike/walk/run/bicycle ride. All the data would be lost. The rebooting problem has only worsened over time. Now sometimes it reboots while just the music player is running. No, I haven't contacted Pantech about it, as the phone only cost me forty bucks and I plan to buy a Samsung Galaxy SII from either Virgin or T-Mobile.Oh, and the MASSIVE Android malware security hole that was recently made public? Pantech has not only not yet released a fix for this phone (as of this writing), but when it does YOU have to go to the Pantech site and download and install it yourself. You will need a Windows PC to do that, Macs need not apply unless you know how. Pantech won't push it out to your phone, I'm not sure they are even capable of doing that. If you do any banking or credit transactions with your phone, only buy one whose manufacturer has fixed that.That's the other thing I should mention: AT&T;'s GoPhone plans work pretty well for talk and text. I have been using the $2/day plan which only costs me if I use the phone, and I tried to use to phone ONLY to make VoIP calls over wifi networks. Doing that religiously is a great way to contain costs, but it really negates the whole point of having a phone for data connections: if I only connect to the 'net when I'm in wifi range, I might as well just use my laptop. Working this way essentially reduces my phone to an Android iPod Touch.So here's the scoop: it you want to use this AT&T; phone for data connections, expect to pay in the area of fifty to eighty-five bucks per month, according to the nice people at the AT&T; store. And it will be a 3G connection at best, which is fairly slow.Upshot is, I'm looking at a new phone and a new carrier. My technophobe wife will probably inherit this P8000 Crossover. It's a great starter unit (well, ignoring the possible security issues) for learning how to work with smartphones, but it will leave you wanting something better. That's the bad news. The good news is that almost everything else is better.","July 26, 2013",0

mobile phone,It's okay.,Shannon,RQMLATM1RN9WB,3,"I'm on my second month with this phone on Virgin Mobile, having switched over from a MyTouch Slide on TMobile.I chose this phone because the reviews were good, but mostly because of the slide-out keyboard. Touch screen is fine, but I really prefer the slide-out querty keyboard for typing more than a short text message. The keyboard is okay. It's not as big as the one on my MyTouch was, and I bump my fingers all the time when I'm using the top row. Also don't love the placement of some of the keys.So far I've found that lots of apps in the app store aren't compatible with it. They just don't appear in my Market... but when I'm looking at the app store from my Kindle Fire, I see ""Not compatible with the Optimus"" on numerous apps. I don't really understand why this is the case, and it's kind of a bummer.I've had some issues with the home screen flashing and had to restart the phone. It's less than 2 months old, so that's concerning me. I really hope it lasts--although so far I love using Virgin Mobile, it would stink if I had to replace a phone over and over--and since this is the only slider they have, I don't have another good option.No flash on the camera--which means it takes terrible photos.Most importantly, the battery life is unbelievably bad. Not just average-smart-phone-battery bad. I mean really, really bad. I let it charge all night while I sleep, but it's usually dead by afternoon. I stay home with my kids, but if I worked out of the home, I'd have to take a charger with me to work because it definitely wouldn't make it through the day. I use an app to protect the battery power, but even with that it's still a huge pain.All in all... two months in and it's working okay for me. Some disappointments so far, but since I have another android device for playing games and such, it doesn't put me out too much.

So, while I'm amazed at all the neat stuff it does, it clearly is junky and doesn't work as designed.-Everyday error messages randomly popup saying applications must force close down.. some of them are ones I'm in the middle of using (like messaging ((so I lose my message I'm typing))) or Facebook) while others happen to be ones running in the background, like Twitter.-WAY TOO many of my messages don't send even when I have coverage (service). I get messages saying ""Message couldn't send"".. I push the resend button or copy and paste text 3x and each time it will still say it can't send. And it will leave a big red triangle with an exclamation on the thread until you delete the message that wouldn't send.-messages take quite a while to actually send.. and videos and take up to 2 hours for me.-The battery life is AWFUL!!! (But, I have mercy on my review in regards to this area because I do use the phone all day, so I expect for it to be drained.)-The time on my phone randomly switches from the current time to an hour back at random times of the day for hours at a time so I can't even rely on it for the time!-While it will alert me I have a new email, it wont' actually display the email until I ""refresh"" the page.-Also, for some strange reason it acts strange when it has any sort of case on it -- the calls take longer to pick up even after I push the answer button, and a screen protector on this phone makes it malfunction.PS. The first phone I was sent gave me these problems so I sent it back for a replacement, but this phone does basically all the same things expect it doesn't freeze up like the first one did so I'm assuming it's not broken -- it's just not a good phone.I DON'T recommend this phone.HOWEVER, calls seem to sound clear and it plays YouTube videos very well.. and there are some great apps and such!

mobile phone,"Phone is great, but serious issues with text messaging",R. Donato,R3144QXTD0XGP2,3,"Hello,This is my first review, so you won't find any under my name. But I am a real customer. It's taken a lot for me to even write this. I was looking forward to using Virgin Mobile since I've also used AT&T; and Verizon. But I wanted a phone with a lower monthly charge. The phone is great. I can get emails, surf the net, the battery life is much longer than I expected, and I make calls just fine. The one thing I can't do is receive text messages, which is about 90% of my communication. I can send them and they are received by the other parties. But I have yet to receive a single text message from anyone outside of the Virgin Mobile (VM) network. Since all of my friends and co-workers are either on AT&T; or Verizon, text messaging is useless. I called VM customer service: my phone was reset three times with no result. I called again and was told to turn off the phone, reseat the battery after 15 seconds, then restart the phone. I was assured that in 10 to 15 minutes, all my text messages would display. I did that process twice and still no messages. I called two more times to hear from the first ""live advisor"" that it would take 4 days to fix the issue. I was horrified. When I called back again to say that amount of time really wasn't acceptable, I was told by the second advisor that it would take 9 business days. I could not believe what I was hearing. I asked to speak with a manager. None were available. When I expressed amazement, disappointment, and annoyance at the situation, I was told only then that they would expedite my ticket to resolve it in 24 to 48 hours. Now seriously, their network isn't connected properly to AT&T; and Verizon? I can't possibly be the first person who's had this issue. And I can't believe that something so basic has been overlooked and that the amount of time it takes to resolve it is so long. I gave this two stars because if the network isn't functioning properly and you are primarily a texter, the phone is useless. This is strictly a VM phone. It's not like an iPhone where you can change providers. So be sure if you get this phone to immediately test to see if you get text messages. If you aren't, call in for a ticket immediately. If you are like me, the wait will be unbearable.Once this situation is resolved, I'll add an update. And I might change the rating depending on how quickly they resolve the issue. I was told that they would adjust my monthly change for this month since I've not been able to use the feature.UPDATE:The text issue was given to the tier-2 department and was partially fixed within 24 hours. I made sure that I could receive texts from my AT&T; and Verizon friends.I even sent myself SMS from gmail. That worked also. Unfortunately, I no longer get automated text messages from Amazon when a product is shipped nor when a delivery is made. This is a big deal since I order a lot of supplies from this site. In Amazon, I made sure to update the service provider for my phone. And even though Amazon Customer Service and I both updated my information, I'm still not able to receive texts from them. When I called VM to see if they could correct it on their end, I was told that they can't handle automated text messages. Bummer!As for the phone itself, the sound quality isn't as good as other providers. I get a lot more, ""what did you say?"" from people. Dropped calls happen a little more but not much to cause serious annoyance. And since I'm paying less than half what I used to, I can live with it.UPDATE: September 7thHere are some additional issues I've been dealing with.Amazon text messages: I'm still not getting them even though VM now saying that I can get automated text messages. They keep insisting that it's an amazon issue. But I've called Amazon customer service and I'm fine on this end. Tier-2 techs are still working on the problem. But since this is the third separate time I've called about this issue, I'm not holding my breath that it will be resolved.Storage space: I purchased this cell in April. By July, I started getting low storage messages. I haven't downloaded a lot of apps, or store a lot of pics or music on the phone. A big part of the problem is that there are default apps on the phone (like Facebook, Twitter, Poynt, SCVNGR, etc.) that I can't delete or move to the SD card. These apps take up a lot of space. Once my cell gets to a certain storage level, I can't read new text messages (which is my primary form of communication). I have to delete apps I want to make space just to read new TMs. That's happened about 3 times already, and it takes a while before I can read the messages so yes it's very annoying. There's apparently a way to freeze unwanted apps using titanium backup. I haven't researched it yet, so I can't say how effective it is.Minor email issue: I get email from gmail and hotmail on my phone. When I get a hotmail message, I get notified once per incoming email. However, with gmail I get two notifications per email: one from my gmail app, and one from the phone. I called VM Customer Service to find out if I could turn one of the notifications off. Sadly, the answer is no, I can't do that.Dual Phone numbers: Some cell phones can support two phone numbers at once. This phone doesn't have that feature. When I called VM CS to ask if they had phones that could support dual numbers, I got a very sarcastic response. She actually laughed at me and said no cell phone could do that. I politely said that there were phones that could support two numbers and that she clearly answered my question. I'm actually pretty tech savvy, so I could have done without the sarcasm. But to actually laugh at customer who's asking a question is just down-right rude.VM CS: I can tell that the customer service reps try to be polite. But even as some of them try to be, they can be pretty condescending. As a result I'm not always patient with them when they talk down to me. Another pet peeve I have is that they shorten my first name even when I give them my entire first name. It wouldn't be so annoying if it weren't for the fact that they say my name in every sentence.On the positive side: The phone is durable. I'm a bit of a klutz and have dropped the phone a few times. It still works, hasn't exploded on contact, and hasn't cracked. For that, I'm very grateful. My next phone, however, probably won't come from Virgin Mobile.","April 11, 2012",0

I'm currently a Verizon customer with a non-smart phone (I use it just to text and make calls [gasp!]) but wanted to lower my monthly bill. First, its not $35 per month, its $35 + tax. I wasn't expecting that but when you're trying to lower your bill every buck counts.As far as the phone itself, I had a couple of issues with it. First, the instruction book told you to first put in the battery but did not tell you how to remove the cover! You had to read further on about the SD card to find out how to remove the cover. The next item that bothered me was the slide out keypad. It's too easy to slide and it is impossible to see the numeric symbols unless you are in a bright room. The phone also comes with unneeded bloatware that you cannot remove.Concerning the service, my first call was dropped. The ""bars"" fluctuate from zero to 3.

For example the calendar will not easily link to G-Mail. It continually defaults to the daily view, and you need two more steps to get to the monthly view.The calendar in the new phone will not accept tasks or appointments, and I still have to figure out how to do this after 3 days of research. Also, using the calendar means defaulting to the Google online calendar which means expensive web use. I do not trust the Google calendar, as you now have no privacy and your records go in to the database.I am still looking for a small, simple calendar app, and will try the Pure Calendar app. (Found one : CalenGoo)New installed apps do not show up as icons (for example CalenGoo). You have to manually install it, and this is not easy. There is no weather icon, and hookup to the Weather Channel is not easy. The pull-out keyboard, whilst handy is not easy to use either.You have to read the manual over and over, or you will mess up.I find with my heavy use that the battery life is 10-12 hours, which is unacceptable.Follow-up February 9th 2012:I am now happier with the phone after a very detailed examination of the downloadable manual.I learn something new every day.But there are still problems:- Not easy to use- Battery life poor- Unable to install drivers from LG web site. This site is terrible.- Do not put a shell on the phone. It is very difficult to remove.- Buy a 16 MB microSD cardWhen you activate the speaker to listen to messages, and then have to punch in numbers to delete etc., you cannot use the onscreen keyboard, but have to use the pull-out with its awkward use.So..... I guess I'll try the Motorola Triumph, and probably get upset again. I'll have to wait for a truly great Samsung phone.I was spoilt with my HTC Inspire, and I long for the old days. Pity I'm so poor that I have to use Virgin Mobile.Definitely not recommended.Follow up Jan 28th:I now find the phone much better after installing:Astrid To-Do List and Reminder, JuiceDefender Ultimate (also need the free basic app), CalenGoo (Calendar) and Evernote.- I still don't like the poor battery life, and the need for a 180 page manual (downloaded from the Virgin Mobile site).- The manual that comes with the phone sucks as it is poorly printed, too small print and the icons indecipherable.- The camera is lousy and is only 3 MP. At least a 5 MP camera is desired,and would cost LG about 75 cents. The pictures are also hard to view.I now think that because of their Virgin Mobile's lousy phones that I should switch to another company.Truly awful customer service, with a human voice very hard to get.Still not recommended.Follow up one month later: (February 9th 2012)- Still hard to use.- The keyboard is hard to use with the light coming from the front. The red keys are invisible. Why LG did not make the keys white with black lettering is unbelievable.- The LG website is terrible. I have been unable to download the drivers for the USB port.- What really drives me crazy is when the phone rings when it is on sleep. Thee are three steps to answering. I've missed many calls. In other phones, I just tap the screen and connect.Download the manual from the LG website and read it carefully. You will go crazy otherwise.([...])Don't buy a shell for the phone - it is difficult to remove.Do buy a larger micro-SD card (16 MB)I am happier with the phone now, but it is a beginner's phone, and is far from ideal.","January 23, 2012",0

mobile phone,Falls short of almost the perfect device,agsn,R2OBG4M2P8FKC0,3,"What I expected when I bought this device was to finally have one device that I can use one device as a tablet and a phone. But what it ended up being was it was too small for a tablet and too big for a phone. This phone is uncomfortably big for it to be no longer a one hand device. Only when you lose the ability to use your phone one handed do you realize how much of an inconvenience it is. I already knew that size might be an issue and was fully prepared to deal with it for the ability to use it as a tablet. But disappointingly that was not to be. The problem of using this as a tablet is the screen resolution (800 pixel width in portrait mode) is just not enough to read web pages and books(pdf). The text is slightly smudged when displayed on 800 pixel width display, but becomes really hard to read when that screen is 5.3 inches, 800 pixel width is perfectly fine on a larger(7 inch or bigger) tablet as the slightly smudged text would still be large enough to easily read, but not on 5.3 inch screen. I ended up using the landscape mode to read books and webpages, which made the point of having a device of this size pointless. I can do the same with no difference on a 4.5 inch screen too. The point I am trying to make is when I went for this device the expectation was to be able to read webpages and books in portrait mode without having to scroll, but the device resolution fails at this. So Samsung if you are reading this review, you have made the almost perfect all in one device, please bump up the resolution(width should have more than 1000 pixels ideally 1600x1000) of this device, other wise this would be a almost but not enough device.","December 22, 2011",0

mobile phone,OK Phone,ferbio,R2OLXVPDL6KXFL,3,After using this phone I am regretting choosing this one over the one with the slide-out qwerty keyboard that got excellent reviews from other users. This phone uses the old keypad format for text entry which was a little disappointing. It does compensate with a pretty cool hand-writing function which works well but is still slower than typing with keyboard. The settings are a little awkward too. I purchased the SD memory chip and USB cable but am still having trouble loading music and pictures from my computer to the phone. Having triple minutes is nice and it is working out to be much cheaper than the local carrier plan I was locked into for 2 years.,"January 7, 2012",0
mobile phone,One truly infuriating feature,To The Point,R3BMR6AQSCQKXI,3,"I like this phone for everything except 2 things: making phone calls, and keeping time. That's right, it sucks for phone calls. Why? Because it has that really infuriating feature all touchscreen phones have, only worse -- it automatically locks the screen within seconds. Yes, it can be unlocked, but it locks again within seconds. Over and over. And you can't turn off the feature. Imagine making a call to any business with an automated response interactive system, and you keep having to unlock it, press the dial pad icon, then press the number for a response, all within seconds. Now imagine having to do that while trying to be handsfree. I don't care what the overreactive, irrational justification (a solution in search of a problem) was for this feature, not being able to turn it off is unacceptably to-the-bone-marrow stupid. The other boneheaded feature of Tracfone's software is that the world clock is wrong. And can't be corrected. It shows my area, Washington, DC, as being an hour behind New York City. I mean, is this phone a microcosm of the intellect of today's world or what?","July 2, 2012",0

mobile phone,LG800G Touch Screen,A. Fierman,R9YKOKRCDJC36,3,"I have had the LG800G Tracfone for about four months and have differing thoughts. It is a good deal for a touch screen. When it first came out, the price point was at $59.99. Now (July 2012) it is at $49.99. When I got mine through the Tracfone website, it was at $39.99. Amazon is offering it for $32.99, which is a good deal. The phone is easy to use and for a prepaid phone is a giant leap for the technology available. Everything about the phone is fantastic except for texting. There is no stylus provided with the phone and texting with your fingers is difficult. There are different methods of texting input. You can use the ABC method like the older analaog phones were. You can use the QWERTY keyboard, which is difficult to do unless you use a pencil or other ""stylus"". You can use the hand writing method. I have been told that I print like a walking typewriter (Thanks to Mrs Foster my fourth grade teacher). Even with this, I have to attempt up to five times to get a ""T"" not to register as a ""J"". Be careful also about how you carry the phone when not in use. The touch screen is very sensative and could engage when you don't want it to. It is also annoying when getting a call. As soon as you get the call, the screen goes into the lock mode and you have to hold the unlock icon if you need to press any keys for input, (Like when the prompt comes for you to enter 1 for this or enter 2 for that). I do like the phone for daily use. I just can't text with it. Tracfones are relatively inexpensive so I have a second one that I use for texting. My friends and family have gotten used to me having more than the one phone number. Is it a Smart Phone? It could be with the right apps. Tracfone is pretty ""propriotary"" with their software and can only be downloaded through their sites so you are very limited on what you can do. I am retired now and do not use my phone as I used to but like to have an upgrade from the ""clamshell"" type of phones. If you can use a phone with touchscreen but again do not use the phone as your PC, this one is good. If you use your phone for texting, this one could really slow you down. Make sure you know what you are getting into when you get this one. I might just retire this one into one of my desk drawers and go back to my LG500C. After writng this review, I have done just what I said I might do. Retired the LG800G into the top right drawer of my desk and used my LG500G I got from Amazon. I hope this helped you make your decision of getting this phone or not.","July 4, 2012",0
mobile phone,"I really wanted to like this, but will got with a Samsung 404G instead. Wasted $40. *Sigh*",Michael Gmirkin,R2OU2XP5OQXRIG,3,"I really wanted to like this phone, because of the triple minutes for life.And the triple minutes part I *DO* like. But, honestly, the touch interface is more of a hassle than it's worth and I doubt I'd use apps much (twitter would be about the only thing I can think of off hand, and even that I'd rather have a full on laptop for anyway)...Basically, the touch interface seems terribly imprecise and with some terrible interface decisions. the on-screen buttons are too small, so half the time when you're trying to click a ringtone to preview it, you end up clicking on it and setting it as current when you don't want to. And on the contacts screen the scroll bar at the right is about 3 pixels wide, thus impossible to hit accurately, and not only that but the green 'call' button for every contact is RIGHT NEXT TO THE SCROLLBAR, so half the time you're trying to scroll down and end up accidentally dialing the phone number next to where you were trying to click/drag the scroll bar, wasting minutes and annoying your friends. Then when you WANT to click on a ph# and tap it in your contact record, half the time it ends up scrolling left or right to the NEXT CONTACT and NOT dialing the ph# of the person you just clicked on. Then you try to scroll back to the correct friend and you end up dialing the wrong person again.Sorry, but the interface just aggravates me. And then there are silly things like the main screen prepaid button that you CAN'T MOVE. Y'know the button you click to find out the information that's already scrolling along the bottom of the screen anyway (days & minutes of service remaining). Yeah, you can't even move the icon around on the screen. It has to be on the left side, one space down from the top. I mean, other icons you can drag around or remove from the main screen via the little blue tab at the bottom. But, no, not that one icon. I mean, you can't even change its position. What kind of shoddy interface design is that? Couldn't they make it so it can be moved to a less conspicuous location on the main screen, but just not removed completely? That would have been fine. But hard-coding it to a single location?On a more physical side, the phone is all shiny and sleek. So, it looks nice. Until you actually try to handle it. Just putting the battery cover on, I damn near dropped the thing it was so slick (slippery). And the nice shiny glossy screen picks up nice shiny glossy fingerprints and pocket lint like nobody's business. I can tell this would aggravate me completely as I generally prefer to keep my stuff un scuffed and as pristine as possible. Okay, after years of use my Samsung 301 had a few minor scratches on the screen from being in the pocket with keys. But I generally managed to keep it clean and in good shape. But, yeah, it's been pretty impossible to keep this thing fingerprint free. I suppose I could get one of those plastic screen protectors, but why bother?It was a tough call when I originally picked up the LG 800, since I really liked my Samsung 301 and there were both the LG 800 & the Samsung 404 available with triple minutes from Tracfone. Fred Meyer only had the LG 800, so I decided to pick that up rather than paying an extra $10 and having to wait a few days for the Samsung 404 to come via mail. I think I made the wrong call (if FM had the 404, I'd honestly have chosen that, I think). I was honestly hoping that I'd like the touch interface or that it would at least be usable and the triple minutes would make up for it. So far, I'm not much impressed. Sorry LG. gotta' be honest. The tiny scrollbar with call buttons placed RIGHT NEXT TO IT kills it for me. I shouldn't be ""afraid to use my phone."" Unfortunately, I kind of am based on how the interface of this thing is laid out. Imprecise touch operation and poor interface design seem to conspire to make this thing do things it shouldn't. Especially when it comes to mis-dialing and either annoying friends or wasting minutes, that's a no-no. Just my candid opinion.So, I've ordered the Samsung 404 qwerty keypad slider phone, like I should have in the first place (since I very much like the 301 I've had for some time now). I hope it gets here before my trip to Las Vegas next week so I can have that in my pocket rather than this finnicky touch phone.","January 1, 2012",0
mobile phone,"Just OK, but you can do better",R. Arnold,RRLEGQ802YIZ7,3,"As another reviewer stated, it's a poor mans smart phone. While it isn't that smart, it will get the job done. The best thing I can say about this phone is the triple minutes for life. LG uses a proprietary software, so you can find apps for it, but not as many as you'll find for phones with other operating systems. The phones screen is not as responsive as other touch screen phones and it lacks some of the amenities that other pay-as-you-go phones have such as a dedicated email client. Having gone through 3 of these phones, I can tell you that for whatever reason, it's going to freeze and reboot at some point, hopefully while you're not in the middle of something important.If I had it to do over again, I would seriously look at the Motorola EX124g. It seems to have everything that LG forgot to do with the 800G, such as a dedicated email client, a 3MP camera as opposed to a 2MP, a more responsive touch screen, an included stylus and support for an 8GB memory card as opposed to the LG's 4GB.","May 23, 2012",0
mobile phone,Touch screen autolock is a big nuisance,Hogo Lidd,R224KWTNCNMICA,3,"My wife has had this phone for about 6 months. It has been ok.The main drawback I want to warn prospective buyers about is the autolock feature. The touch screen autolocks; unlocking requires a couple of seconds of pressure on the onscreen ""unlock"" button. While you can set different delays, including ""never"", this has no effect during a call, making it very frustrating to navigate voicemail or an answering machine tree. The screen will lock while you're listening to the prompt, and by the time you unlock and recover the dialpad, it's repeating the prompt or you've missed your chance to respond... Many people have complained about this on tracfone and LG forums, but there is no remedy. Several have suggested pressing the on/off button to unlock, which is quicker than the touchscreen button.","October 22, 2013",0
mobile phone,Nice Phone But Think Twice About Net10/Tracphone,WA8UOC,R2FN8P34E9ZAWS,3,"I have been a Net10 customer for the past five years and have had good service. If you need to buy minutes or basic needs on their web page you will be OK, BUT if you need to talk to someone for help you may be in for a real experience. My wife and I have had Net10 phones for five years and have been happy. I decided to purchase a new phone for my wife that would be easier to text from so I purchased the LG-800G. It came in two days and looks like it would do a nice job for us. My wife does not use her phone much so her minutes pile up. I use my phone much more so I don't have many minutes but lots of service days.I called and spoke to a Net10 Service Rep. and asked if they could transfer the 2200 minutes from My wife's phone to my phone. The Rep. said ""Sure"". She had me enter data on my wife's phone to take the minutes off her phone and move them to my phone. Well, she got the minutes off of her phone but they never showed up on my phone. I have been on the phone for several hours the past three days with no success. I have been given Ticket Numbers for special help. These have no meaning as the next person I talk to has no idea why I am calling and I have to explain why I am calling each time. The reps. spend most of your time updating their logging system and not providing any meaningful help to the customer.My last call was to a specialist who spent his time updating his records and then told me he was replacing my phone and I would have to return my phone which is out of warranty. He had no idea if that would fix my problem. At that point, I had had enough and told him to keep the phone and I would look for a new carrier. I have read other reviews from people with similar experiences. NOW I know what they are talking about. Net10/Tracphone has good products but their customer support is about as bad as it gets. I am seventy one years old and have never experienced customer service this bad.","April 2, 2013",0

mobile phone,Phone = Junk; Triple Minutes = Worth It Anyway,Jonathan Savory,R2JEQJFMFA2TLH,3,"This is pretty simple - I bought this phone, with ""Triple Minutes for Life,"" for only slightly more than what Trac charges for a ""Double Minutes for Life"" card. Hands down, that's a darn good deal.That said, this phone is not smart and does a terrible job even pretending.The touchscreen is resistive, like the card swipe kiosk at the supermarket; it isn't capacitive, like every touchscreen phone you're thinking you might like to own. This resistive screen, which is tiny, is very difficult to use quickly and accurately, as you really need to press your finger flat down to get a good read, by which time you've missed your mark.While the phone has a web browser, it is WAP based, not true IP based like the browser on iPhone or Android. This means essentially any modern website you enjoy using is crippled to the point of being essentially unavailable. The browser is also disgustingly slow. Slowness might be forgiven under the circumstances of such a cheap phone - except that Trac charges you not by data consumed, as every other mobile company would do, but by the time you spend with the web browser open. Since the browser is slow, and may take a minute to load a web page that turns out to be unusable, you're just throwing your minutes away every time you open the browser. I've taken to just writing a note to myself and waiting til I get home. It takes pure desperation for me to use the web on this phone now.The phone plays MP3s, but the player isn't well organized and has poor management options, and the audio quality produced by the hardware is low. So forget that part too.You can play some very dull preinstalled Java games circa 2004, or pay about half-a-month's worth of minutes to download more. Erase that form your mind too.So why on earth would you buy this phone?It makes phone calls, and receives them. Wow. I know. But the key here is that you can have a phone in your pocket that will cost you only about 10 cents per minute. With a year's worth of service for just over one hundred smackers netting nearly 1500 minutes, this is as good as it gets. If you are on a tight budget, as I am, and don't really talk on the cell phone except to keep family posted on your whereabouts, this phone might only cost you those hundred smackers annually and nothing more.Ah, now you are starting to understand. One hundred smackers a year versus that what... five or six hundred through other plans? I remember a time when I didn't ""need"" a cell phone. It was easy to give up the bells and whistles to save that much money.Thank you and good night.","February 12, 2013",0

You listed to it and want to delete it by pressing 7. Guess what - phone is locked. May not seem to be a big deal, but very annoying after a while.

On the fifth day the touch screen began to be unresponsive intermittently. Fortunately, I had installed a micro SD card and was able to transfer all the contact information I had entered to the micro SD card.When I called Tracfone customer support I found the reps to be very willing to be helpful and very polite. (Considering that a lot of folks, when they call tech support of any kind, unleash their pent up anger on these reps who had no personal part in the problem that the customer is experiencing, it was refreshing to find the reps at Tracfone so willing to be helpful and so polite.)I am currently waiting for a replacement new phone from Tracfone, it should arrive soon. I fully expect that this is one of those ""manufacturing defect"" type situations that can literally happen with any product. The LG800G comes bundled with ""triple minutes for the life of the phone"" (one heck of a deal). Essentially you get two free minutes for every minute you purchase. Hopefully I'll get at least a couple of years out of the replacement phone, wish me luck.........","August 9, 2012",0

The video/sound recordings are horrible compared to other similar phones, and the camera while it works okay, does not take as good of pictures as other camera phones.For an example-We were at a concert and others around us, were using their phones in a similar way and getting crystal clear pictures, video and sound, while my daughter did not :-(I have seen.

mobile phone,phone seems fine - Tracfone makes it impossible to activate,"Cynthia, AZ",R2OC5WH6ESJXLK,3,"Went online to transfer my old number from my Tracfone that died. Website would not work, after many attempts said call to activate, that would be fine but I have no phone. Got someone to come over, reps very busy, after many attempts got through and arrived at the gates of hell. Heard many reps all talking in the background, that and static made it very hard to communicate. This rep needed to pass info to other rep to complete process, rep very busy. Used up friends minutes, waiting over 30 minutes, it took 30 to get to wait another thirty. Asked for call back when they got the other person on the line, said okay....lied. After another 30 minutes called back. This guy seemed to know what he was doing....I was wrong. After 20 minutes said it was complete, number and minutes transfered, wait one hour and call someone and that will activate phone. This is day three of receiving phone. Seems to be a nice paperweight. Tried emailing, only got canned response to something I did not ask about. Website won't allow me to drop minutes and just get a new number, you still have to call in. In AZ I am not sitting in 117 Â° for an hour to deal with that mess again. Tracfone fix your wrbsite, read our email, hire more employees, spread them out and train them!UPDATE - The following day I decided to start an account on their website to tell them how I feel. It took me to my account and showed my phone as pending so I clicked on it and found nine strings of numbers to enter on my phone. Then it kicked me out, went back in and found another five strings of numbers. And now my phone is on. This would have be simple information to give me over the phone or in the email I sent begging for help. So if you are buying a phone for the first time, with a new number it should be painless.

mobile phone,Lacks Endurance,Rebecca,R30NBJ9DCNRFS,3,"I've had this phone for almost a year now, and it has certainly served it's purpose. I haven't had any issues sending or receiving messages and phone calls, and it's done everything I need it to do... just not as smoothly as I think it should. I decided to write a review from the perspective of someone who has had the phone long enough to know the bugs.The touch screen worked well for the first month or two, and I finally began to get used to texting on it. Unfortunately over time the phone has become less and less responsive. (And I am not hard on electronics) It still works with a little extra pressure, but this can become frustrating. The touch sensitivity is not 100% accurate either. You'd think after a year I would be used to texting on the number keypad, but the phone frequently thinks I'm typing a key across the screen. Unfortunately, it often thinks I'm hitting the clear button when my finger is a few buttons away. Also, the phone has difficulty sensing touch in some of the menus. I can push a button 10 different ways and it still won't open sometimes.I love Tracfone, and this phone has served its purpose, but I would not recommend it. I finally am getting so fed up with trying to push buttons and navigate menus that I'm getting a different Tracfone without a touch screen.What I do love about this phone is the speaker quality for both calls and the music player. I've also had very few issues with it unlocking in my pocket and making calls. The battery life is phenomenal and will last me five days to a week with moderate usage.If you're going Tracfone (which I recommend because it is so much cheaper than everyone else!) I would suggest avoiding touch screens because they are not quite up to the standard responsiveness that we are used to.

I even left it alone, fully charged on an open table overnight - next morn it was off (not locked, but really powered off.) TracFone sent me a replacement - took 1.5 hours to get them to do that. The replacement worked better. Was on the phone with TracFone another half-hour getting the talk-time/phone # transferred. When I added minutes I realized they replaced my triple-minute phone with a double-minute phone. Took another 3 hours to get that straightened out. 6 months later the replacement started doing the same thing with the power. I'd have to re-seat the battery to get it to work again [This is faster than calling customer service.]I agree with other reviewers about the auto-lock feature. It's really, really annoying for checking voicemail [dial, unlock phone, get to dial-pad, enter security pin, listen to everything you missed while typing, unlock phone, press 1 to listen to message, unlock phone, press a number, listen, unlock phone, etc... Shutting off auto-lock does NOT work. I'm so fed up with all the time I've wasted on getting this model to work that I'm now looking at a different model.","April 14, 2013",0

Wonderful customer support and help when needed. They allowed me to buy a 800 G phone due to hand issues. When I dropped it and things got screen jumpy. Tracfone was there to fix or replace.

mobile phone,Triple minute phone,"Harry T. Goodwin ""Hairy Wolf""",R32XI4JFYF0HSG,3,I am unable to change the auto lock timer and it locks up as soon as a number is sent. This makes retrieving voice mail difficult.By the time I unlock it the voice-mail is hanging up. It has to be unlocked in order to enter the password. To make matters worse when the auto-lock kicks on the dial-pad disappears. Of course this a smart phone and maybe its being operated by a not so smart person. But I am disappointed. The triple minutes are great and using the phone where accessing the dial-pad after dialing is not necessary the phone is 5 stars. But forget it for checking voice mails. At least for the phone I am using.,"December 29, 2012",0

It also sends and receives well in fringe areas. I am having a problem when receiving calls, text, or messages. It wants to go into lock down mode. I then need to hold unlock for 5 seconds before I can answer or read messages. I have set lockdown to never come on but that does not help. Somewhat aggravating although I am learning to live with it. I called TrakFone and they suggested various things to try but to no avail.

The phone is a little larger than a credit card and fairly thin-would fit in a shirt pocket easily. The touch screen is difficult to use (even with a stylus) and dialing can be a huge problem-misdials happen often. The in-call volume is low-medium at its' highest setting and people have complained that they could not hear me well-even while shouting. The best feature of this phone is the triple minutes-which is worth it for a phone that was purchased for occasional use. Tracfone's customer service is a different review, but, to say the least, IF you can ever get through to a live person, you'll be taken care of-the secret is to go through the Lifelink prompts and keep hitting ""0"".

I talked to a rep from South America who waited until my phone was "" half activated"" to tell me ""it"" would only allow 500 minutes to transfer. Now I had never seen this mentioned anywhere so I argued with her about this. She just kept telling me that "" it"" was doing this and not her and she couldn't change ""it""' AND, because she had already half activated the phone she said it was too late to just keep my original phone and minutes. Well, I told her she knew what she could do with those minutes so she said she ""could no longer serve (me)""and transferred me to a manager. He immediately said she was wrong and that he had to transfer 500 minutes at a time. If I hadn't argued with her I would have lost 1000+ minutes that I had payed for.

However, keep in mind that things are cheap for a reason. The quality isn't that good. The front-facing camera really sucks, very grainy and unfocused. The home button stopped working too, it just won't react when I press it. Additionally, I had a very hard time turning it on. Once I turn it off, it seems like I can't turn it back on no matter how many times I press it. I had to press the power button for a long time before it turned on. Not only that, the whole entire system just sucks. I have to wait a long time for the phone to load after turning it back on, and it's hard to make outgoing calls sometimes. The phone started having more and more malfunctions after using it, and I had problems with the charger. It just wouldn't charge, and the battery would die out really fast. It's even worse now that I've had it for a year. When I start charging, the screen freezes and turns completely white. I'm planning to buy a new phone now. This phone is okay for beginners at smartphones, but it can't last a year. As I stated, this phone is cheap for a reason. If you're willing to take the risks, then spend the money. But consider getting this phone as an alternative since it'll prove to be a disappointment. It's better to get a longer-lasting phone that costs more money than this cheap one that can't even last a year.","November 9, 2013",0

I'll keep you all updated as I make a leap of faith myself. I have researched for about 2-3 weeks and decided to buy this phone based on the reviews I've read so far. Once I placed the order, I emailed the seller to request that they send me a white phone since there was no option to select from. I must say I'm amazed at the excellent customer service. Today is Saturday and I wasn't expecting to hear from them though their page says I'd be contacted in about 12 hours of the request. Amazingly, I received a response in less than 5 hours, confirming that I'd be sent a white phone and assuring me of a great buying experience. The seller I purchased from is ""Pro2011"".I know there are many people out there who are still considering to buy your first phone from China but quite skeptical about it. Well, I took the risk today and will write a full review when the phone comes. I have Amazon Prime with the two-day shipping, so I'm expecting to receive the phone by Tuesday March 19th or the 20th. Stay tuned and I'll keep you updated with as honest and thorough review to help you make a decision too.This is my revised review on Tuesday March 19th,2013.....I received the phone today but wasn't quite happy at all. I don't know if anyone had the same experience but I suspect the phone I received had been used before. I mean there isn't anything that shows the phone is coming from a manufacturer's store. Removable factory screen protector has scratches. Batteries have scratches and show signs of wear. The extra back case that came with the phone seriously has dust particles and scratches, which indicate the phone has been slightly used. My best guess is that it was sent to someone who didn't like it and returned it. In fact, the manual that came with the phone has been read and soiled with some yellowish stain and the one that struck me the most is the fact that the inner part of the top cover of the phone's box has been tempered with, which kind of made me curious because I paid for a NEW phone and not a slightly used phone. I contacted Amazon and seller just under 2 hours from the delivery and hoping to return the phone tomorrow. I really don't want to use it, so I have repackaged the item and ready for return shipping. The only accessories that were sealed as one would expect of a NEW phone were the charger and earphone.Aside this rather disappointing experience, which I surmise may be an isolated case peculiar of the seller I purchased from, I think the phone looks good. Amazon's customer service is beyond excellent. While in the process of writing this review, they responded to my query in less than 5 hours and have already issued a refund and promised a goodwill gesture of a one-day shipping on a similar item.I guess things sometimes don't work out pretty good when we have so much expectations. The other thing that baffles my mind though is the fact that the phone shipped from Las Vagas, NV when all this while I though it was coming from China or somewhere in Asia. So again, it might just be an isolated situation and more of a problem with the seller I purchased from. I haven't given up though. Once I get my refund, I'll order from another seller and hope to receive a new phone this time around. If everything was okay with the phone and I had no doubt whatsoever that it had been used, I'd have been very happy with my purchase as this phone is a rivalry to the Galaxy note and you can't beat the price!","March 16, 2013",0
mobile phone,Not Very Good,Ashlee Harris,RR6DJR5G6RYTL,3,"I have had this phone for only 3 days and I can already tell that I will have to replace it. I really want to like this phone but it is a tad bit slow and also it keeps randomly turning off. My battery will be at 50% and it will decide to turn off on me. I am undecided on whether to send it back or give it a chance. It's very big, nice screen quality, but that's about it. Some of my apps that I downloaded won't work properly on this phone. I'm giving it a chance for now but I feel like I will have to replace it soon.","May 30, 2014",0
mobile phone,disappointed,"Bettina B ""Bettina""",R2NDEHOG891AJZ,3,"I've been using this phone for about 2 months now. To be honest i really like it. I didn't expect a perfect phone, I ordered this product knowing that problems might occur. When I got the product, i installed my T-mobile sim and SD card and it worked!01. CAMERA - the flash is like a flashlight! hahaha really crappy but the camera is pretty good in my opinion! Especially for outdoor photos! If you're indoors, the quality is not that good.02. BATTERY - I've seen alot of people commenting about the battery. I got my phone i was really surprised on how fast the battery drained but after a couple of days, the battery life was longer. It lasts for a whole day and i charge it overnight.03. SOUND - speakers are really bad. I personally don't mind because I like using my headphones. Its okay.04. PERFORMANCE - it was really good, a bit laggy sometimes (but its okay since it's not a perfect phone) I really liked it! I could Call and Text, use my 3G data plan and wifi. It resets by its own for no reason! It happened a couple of times. LATELY its became more irresponsible (like when you want to use task manager on your windows xp) and today its on a reboot loop (Its stuck on that animation where the worm crawls then forms the word android). I've contacted the seller about this problem, hopefully It goes well! I really like this phone and i can't afford another one.","January 28, 2013",0
mobile phone,"eh! indifferent, camera novelty worn off",shilezi,R230LWIME4TC5K,3,"I have been on here to support this phone before but now that i've had it for 2 months. I gotta to say I'm not at all impressed overall. I got a defective phone and by the time i realized the issue is a problem and not the type that goes away with use, I was told i couldn't get an exchange and i gotta go to nokia for repairs.I had the n8 before now. The n8 had lots of issues but it was the most practical for me of all nokias since 6230 or so.N8 could be charged either through the micro usb port or the ac at the bottom( very optimal for gps use) The 808 cannot be charged conviniently while being used as a gps on long distance trips.Apps are not particularly faster on it. I use facebook browser from pixelpipe as its the closest to the real facebook app on symbian in terms of look and html5 convergence. I was manageable on the n8 and not a breeze on the 808.These are the pressing issues for me personally and at this time and i am truly sick of defending nokia over their crappy job at putting customer complaints and requirements ontop of their todo list.I dont intend to use any cfw because i believe this should have been an improvement over the n8 but apparently not. On the n8 from PR1 to belle refresh, the OS got speed improvements that was very DRASTIC! and made the phone very much practically for anything if you've got the patience.Bottomline. If you are just coming to nokia and want to have a phone thats got a relatively the best camera and not seen on every tom, dick and harry, and its got the looks this is it right here.But, if you're like me upgrading from the history making n8, this isn't really an upgrade. Its just the camera and the slightly bigger screen that makes the big difference. Believe me when i say you'll completely ignore this warning for the 1st few months while you're still drooling over what amazing pictures the camera can take.Now that I am enjoying windows 8, i can't wait till i get a WP8 which is likely not anytime soon because i paid $625 for this and i gotta at least get a year and a halfs use off it.","November 26, 2012",0
mobile phone,not quite up to the market right now,Robert L. Gauthier,R1OWB8W9ES5CL6,3,"Got this phone for European travel, usually use an iPhone. My general reaction was that the phone has a somewhat datedoperating system, but that was expected. The software is a bit temperamental and freezes, but no worse than an android phone. The camera is very good, as good as a pocket point and shoot. It is tortuous to download from the phone to a mac, but was able to do so via bluetooth. If this had a modern OS, it would have been a killer phone. And I don't consider Windows mobile a modern system. Good back up and travel phone for me.","August 17, 2013",0

mobile phone,Disappointed,Blue Hen 2011,R14MNIBWUNNQ70,3,"My wife and I text back and forth on our lunch breaks and I was getting tired of texting on my old clamshell Tracfone. This was the cheapest phone with triple minutes on Tracfone and the wifi feature sold me on it. The phone features a 3G connection, wifi connectability, a browser, and e-mail synching.The full blackberry-style keyboard has made texting MUCH faster than a normal clamshell phone. However, the keys are somewhat small and the spacebar frequently glitches and puts in periods if I press it towards the right rather than the left. You can set the keyboard to automatically lock and I've had no problems with it pocket dialing. However, you can still dial 911 while the phone is locked (you press the numbers and it asks you if you want to call SOS).I liked the idea of the e-mail synching on the go but not the execution. Everytime the phone automatically checked my e-mail, I was charged minutes for using the 3G connection. I ended up turning the automatic synching off and I haven't checked my e-mail on it in probably three weeks.For my purposes, the 3G connection is a useless feature. 3G makes sense on my wife's Droid 3 but this phone doesn't have the goods to need a fast connection. I know this is a Tracfone phone but I expected the browser to be better than it is. I hoped against hope that I would be able to watch netflix on the small screen. However, the browser is the same ""fake internet"" browser you'd get on a clamshell phone except with a faster connection. Many sites are incompatible and surfing is difficult. After checking it out the first couple days I had the phone, I haven't used the browser at all.The wifi makes using the fake internet on the phone fairly fast but I just can't get over how clumsy the browser is.Altogether, I'm happy that the phone has made texting about three times faster for me but disappointed in the internet features that initially interested me in the phone.","September 25, 2012",0
mobile phone,Two major issues with it,C. Watson,R1UJIQG3VEECNB,3,"1) Emergency calls when keyboard is locked. My wife has called 911 a few times by accident by keeping this in her purse. This is a ""Feature"" of Tracfone and not necessarily an issue with the phone. Any Tracfone phone that has an exposed keyboard will have this problem. Solution is to dial two or three numbers before locking the screen2) Web Browser button and back button is the same. Many times when backing out of the menu we accidentally go into the web browser. You can disable/restrict some of the apps but not the browser3) Minor issue, unable to find a case for it to cover the keys to prevent #1 above4) Minor issue, will charge off any micro usb cable that I've tried with a computer, but seems to need it's samsung AC adapter when trying to charge from a wall outlet.Other than the above, the phone works well and locks onto a signal quickly after turning on.","June 17, 2013",0

mobile phone,Signal issues caused very poor sound quality,James Mosier,RWIKZBBMZ1HOO,3,"After having replaced the Kyrocera Rise phone with a Samsung Galaxy Reverb and trying another phone ( LG smartphone ) my daughter owns, and using the same network, I find my complaints seem to be much more with a weak signal than anything else. I have a home business office in my basement. The location gives me often just 1 bar and sometimes just drops calls altogether. Before condemning the phone you need to be sure the signal is adequate. Hope this helps others that might experience the same issues.This was my initial review: The phone has decent hours of talk time and you will need the extra battery power because everything you say will have to be repeated. I bought this for business use and if my customers are having trouble hearing me because the sound quality is poor it's difficult to sell them my services. After having at least 6 people tell me they are having trouble hearing me, I knew I would have to return the phone. Amazon has been wonderful about accepting the phone back after having it for 10 days. However it took 6 days just to get it and have my old phone number ported over to this new phone. The customer complaints are many people having the same exact same problem with sound quality.","May 23, 2013",0
mobile phone,An awkward and unreliable physical keypad and schizophrenic touchscreen can make this difficult to use.,Robert Redfeather,R33VALISSUBJFF,3,"Fortunately, this phone comes with the Swype touch keyboard installed, because the touchscreen is often ridiculously unresponsive and the keyboard requires very precise finger-position and finger-pressure to use. The combination makes typing anything letter-by-letter a horrible, headache-inducing hassle.The 2.5 GB per month data is almost adequate, but with the same service package, Virgin would give unlimited data if this were a 4G phone. The 3G data rate is nothing to turn cartwheels over, even after a call to Virgin's customer support because the phone was all but completely unusable for the first month I had it. That call did get the phone to ""useable,"" but I still end up using my Virgin 4G hotspot almost exclusively. 3G is strictly for because-I-have-to situations.","January 10, 2013",0

mobile phone,Lousy batteries! Not great wi-fi.,Brian C,RDQ9QMH60FDU9,3,"I pretty much like the phone - I got it especially for the dual-sim because I live overseas and interchange sims when I travel. But the batteries are the worst ever. One battery didn't even charge right out of the box and the second has the worst charge retention.Another troublesome issue is the wi-fi stability. It constantly loses connection even when my laptop or Blackberry or anything else is connected. Even next to my wi-fi router it goes off and on. Not fun for downloading podcasts or news.Other than that I like the phone itself, the speaker is fine, the apps easy to load, and since it is an Android it can be like any other phone, really.

mobile phone,"The inflexibility of some features needs some working, but otherwise good.",EnochianScript,R1UGXPVVMIF5R4,3,"I purchased this phone as a replacement of my old Galaxy Note 2, expecting very little. With my low expectations, I was quite surprised.This phone works better than similarly priced brand named phones on the market. That is, any Android phone running less than 4.0 was SUPER slow. This phone however had a large screen and was not too slow.My only complaints are these:- The earphone jack is too loose and my headphones slip out of the phone like it's oiled.- I had phone numbers already, and I had A LOT OF TROUBLE getting around the text messaging error. I figured out if you directly type in their contact information as a stream of numbers, i.e. xxxxxxxxx rather than xxx-xxx-xxxx, (xxx) xxx-xxxx, etc, it works just fine. I'm still trying to figure out how to fix that problem.- charger slips out too easily- it gets really hot sometimesOtherwise, things I love:- it came with 2 batteries!!!- one of the two cases the phone came with has a cover. It makes it easy for me to protect the phone screen. That said, I wouldn't risk dropping it.- smooth- still a knock-off; when people ask what brand/model it is, I tell them with humor that it's a good knock-off phoneAgain, I've previously had 3 ""cheap"" Android 2.x phones around the $100-$120 range, and they don't even compare to this phone.UPDATE 10/12, I am lowering my rating.. 3.5 stars really:Okay, so I've had this phone for much longer so I've got some chance to complain about it more. The longer you have it, I feel the longer you really get that it's a knock-off.Here are some more TRICKS AND FIXES:- download another browser; there's something about the built-in one that just really works terribly with this phone- the sound quality is DOWNRIGHT AWFUL; I have to push the phone's speakers directly into my ear to really hear someone sometimes- microphone quality is EVER WORSE; this is NOT the phone to do business with, I've received many many many complaints from custom service reps, friends, and colleagues that they have a hard time hearing me -- once they start saying I sound faint or far away, I cup the phone's microphone hole at the bottom of the phone so the sound bounces from my hand back to the microphone- find another charger if you can; funnily enough, the Kindle charger I had is tight enough that the phone won't fall outSome good notes:- this phone can take a beating, I've dropped it a lot of times.

mobile phone,What Looks Good Isn't Always Good,Jennifer Hickman,RECHX3TPMS0B3,3,"I bought this phone about 2 months ago, and when I first received it I have to admit I was very impressed, My T- Mobile chip worked great in this phone, the camera had a very good picture and video quality, the screen moved on command to my touch and the screen size was amazing. On another note the internet speed was slow, which wasn't a big deal for me because I don't really hang on the web like that anyway. The deal breaker for me was after a week of using this phone problem free, the phone began to act up, for example a small headset icon appeared at the top of the home screen and since then I could only talk to people on speaker phone. I tried everything I could to fix the problem including resetting the phone twice, but to no avail. Till this day the icon is still there. On top of that while talking to people via speaker phone the reception would fade in and out and people would complain of hearing static sometimes. This issue has become so frustrating for me that I am now using an older model phone that I had previously owned. I recently purchased the knock off version of the galaxy S4 in which I am awaiting to arrive in the mail, hopefully it will not have the same flaws as this phone.

In some sites i saw 8 but it doesnt qualify for both. Its barely a 3. Barely. I had a samsung phone with a 5mp camera. It was really good. Takes good,clear pictures. This phone cannot even match up with it. The front facing one is even worse. The picture delays badly when you move the phone. Its just bad.Third. It doesnt have good connection. When i connect it with somewhere i can connect my tablet and my other phone with full bar. It only connects with two and its suuuuuper slowwwwww....most of the time it doesnt get connection at all even when youre in a hot spot.Overall it might pass as a ok phone. But definitely not one with this price. Think secondly when you buy.","September 7, 2013",0
mobile phone,i9220,Larry M,R3UM79KDZA3BB,3,"I purchased this device because my success with another unlocked phones. First off the phone is not 3G which it says in the description of the device, but I decided to take the chance with purchasing this device since people said they were able to get 3G. I can not send/ receive picture messages. There is more than one type of i9220 being sold so if you want a 3G capable phone make it says that it carries the 2100 mhz frequency band. The phone itself is very sturdy and it is a verry nice sized phone. With these types of phones it can be either hit or miss. I am not agaisnt getting phones like this, but just to be on the safe side I recommend ordering the device through fulfilled by Amazon just in case you run into any issues within 30 days of receiving the device you cancel return it.","July 25, 2013",0

mobile phone,Who wants to carry a separate camera??!!!!!,ginger301,R1GCCEEE0MJ9RQ,3,"This item operates fine as a phone that makes calls and sends texts. I wasn't able to receive or send (MMS) pictures. However I think that I just needed to change some settings. I tried to get 4G using my ATT sim card but was never able to. I couldn't get 3G either. It operated on ""edge"" but perhaps that could have improved with APN changes or something but while surfing on the internet it really wasn't that much slower than my Galaxy Note. Audio is a little too low even at highest setting. Truth is the camera on the phone was so bad that I didn't spend too much time checking out many of the phone's other features. The picture quality is the worst I have seen long time. If you want a phone with a camera that you can take decent pictures with...THEN DON'T BUY THIS PHONE!!!!.

This phone seems pretty decent so far, it is responsive, decent screen resolution. It is advertised to seem to have a 5 inch screen, this is not true, the screen is actually 4.25 inches by about 2 and 9/16 inches, it is actually same size as Galaxy s3 screen. Other than that it is pretty good for price range. It comes with 2 batteries but one of them was defective (Amazon was good about this and made it right)one reason I shop Amazon. BUT the need to have 2 batteries is becoming apparent as with little use after being on for about 3 hours battery has dropped to 60% with wireless and blue tooth both off and no calls just sitting,so maybe not so hot in that area,and will be a deal killer for me, have to see how this goes. More later(not much later) home button will not bring it out of sleep mode most of the time seems defective I think I will return it, too much wrong to have any confidence in it. Have had it called to my attention that I am wrong here, my measurements were up and down and straight across,phones are measured same as tv's diagonally so upon re measuring I find that it is still not 5 inches, it measures 4.7 inches diagonally.Close but still not 5 inches.","January 22, 2013",0

mobile phone,TERRIBLE BATTERY LIFE -- WAIT 6 MONTHS to buy the iphone 5 until they work out the bugs,Nolagal,R1C86PFPE9WO3F,3,"I'm reviewing the iPhone 5, not the $1000 iPhone 5 sold here. I bought it via AT&T; for the upgrade price of $199. So price is not the issue here.Love the phone. Hate the battery life. I'm on my 2nd phone and something clearly is wrong. There are loads of people complaining about the battery life on the Apple support forums. It is not clear yet whether it is a hardware or iOS problem, but I can say for sure that this phone does not get HALF the battery life my iPhone 4 had....and I have ""babyed"" it by completely draining the battery and re-charging, turning off WiFI when not in use, turning off LTE & bluetooth when not in use, turning off iCloud passport, turning off email push notifications, NONE of which I had to do on the 4 (except the 4 didn't have passport or LTE). But still, you get the idea.Apple claims the longer battery life is one of the bonuses of this phone. Nothing could be further than the truth for me and many users. I personally have spoken to 4 people who have the issue. Another handful report not having the issue which is good. But 50:50 rate of success is too poor a ratio IMO.I've spent somewhere around 16 hours troubleshooting this with Apple, taking my first one in for a new phone, setting up a new phone for the 2nd time FROM SCRATCH and believe me I'm not happy about this. I've set up twice as new, done hard boots, you name it with tech support.And still, today I surfed Facebook a bit, made a few calls totalling no more than 5 minutes. The phone Usage indicator says I used the phone for more than 5 hours!!! Impossible. Charge was at 100% this morning and with that small amount of use...really...totalling less than one hour...I'm at 10% battery.While the AppleCare representatives are all polite and knowledgeable, I find it especially hard to stomach the scripts they are all taught to say...basically discounting the trouble you are having. You can tell they HAVE to say these things.I really hope hubris doesn't undo Apple, but if this iPhone5 issue and the Apple Maps fiasco is any indicator, they are really on their way down. I read a Wall Street Journal article today regarding the gains Amazon, Samsung and Google are making on Apple.I don't want to see Apple fail because I really like their products. I think they need to get a clue when it comes to not making their customers PAY THEM to BETA TEST. My rate is $29.00/hr. At that rate by my caluclations, they owe me a full refund plus some hourly wages for all the work I've put into this...and STILL NO SUCCESS. For all my trouble I am actually going to ask them for a credit to my account and yeah you can just go on laughing...me too. But I'm going to ask.If I hadn't already passed my 4 onto my son I would take it back. The only reason I upgraded in the first place is because I don't like using a smartphone out of warranty -- too afraid of data loss. So I went for the 5.BOO HISS APPLE.In sum, here's my advice: If you have already bought one and your battery life is not good...take it back and keep taking it back until you get a good one. MAKE SURE THE BATTERY CHARGE IS AT 100% OUT OF THE BOX when you first charge it up. IF NOT, DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME AND ASK FOR ANOTHER PHONE THAT HAS A 100% CHARGE. There is anecdotal evidence that the ones that are not showing up in the box at 100% are the problem phones.SECONDLY, IF YOU HAVE NOT ALREADY TAKEN THE PLUNGE ON THE iPHONE 5, WAIT 6 MONTHS UNTIL (IF) APPLE RESOLVES THIS PROBLEM. The rate of poor battery reports is too high to take the risk, IMO.Hope this helps,**UPDATE***Next day: after talking with Apple Care last night and getting approval, went to the Apple Store today and swapped out the phone for a new one (which was 66% charged out of the box). The guy at the Genius Bar said he thinks its the apps I was using responsible for the battery life. (I had a lot of them on my 4 and the same ones on the 5). He said the apps may have not caught up to the new iOS yet. I'll leave the discussion on who I think is to blame for that for another time. At any rate he came up with 3 or 4 apps from the log which showed crashes. He asked me to restore the phone from new (again) and rebuild it.We left the Apple store and the battery was at 66%. We drove across the highway to another store. Before we could even go in the store the battery had gone to 61%. We turned around and went back to the Apple Store in the mall. By that time the battery was at 59%.Mind you, none of my apps were on this phone. They had just set it up. Talked with a technician and he said it is fine to have 66% battery new in the box and that this sort of battery life loss (7% within 10 minutes) was to be expected on a new phone. He said when I charged it up again it should do better. OK I'm skeptical, but will report back.Meanwhile here I go rebuilding a phone again.One thing I can say is that at least I'm becoming more convinced that this is a software issue and not a hardware issue. A combination of iOS 6 and also apps that iO6 no longer likes (thank you Apple).Also today on Facebook I had two people reply to my post about this that they had new iPhones and their battery was dying before the end of the day. They were suprised at the poor battery life. I also had a friend with a relatively new 4S say the same thing...which leads me to believe it is Apple's new OS that is causing these problems.My last strategy if it doesn't get better is to wipe almost all apps off the phone and just use it as a dumb phone. With a beautiful screen. Hopefully it won't get to that point. If I can remember to I'll come back and post what happened.","December 27, 2012",0
mobile phone,No longer the leader,David T. Alexander,RH392KOLDMLO8,3,"Its an OK phone at best, certainly not insanely great anymore and very expensive for what you get. Battery life is poor at best, and lacks several features of similarly priced or cheaper phones that offer things like expandable storage, swappable batteries and pressure sensitive styluses. Furthermore it isn't universal so you can't easily switch carriers between LTE providers and the features various carriers offer differ greatly and none is a one stop shop. Apple needs to stop worrying about making the phone thinner and lighter, and rather add innovation back to the phone like inductive charging or an all day battery.","January 14, 2013",0

mobile phone,"Good phone, but...",Thomas,R2OYQ37LK7K709,3,"I previously owned the first Galaxy Note, which I loved. I was hesitating to upgrade, but at the end I just couldn't resist, so I ordered it. It's a fabulous phone and it's speed is just outstanding. But I am bit disappointed with the screen. The old model has resolution 1280x800, this one is only 1280x720, which I knew ahead of time, but I didn't really bother about the 80 pixels. Well, but I should have. Because of this reason, it doesn't support 5 icons in line anymore, neither 5 icons wide widgets, which is a shame. I had to install 3rd party launcher, so I can have it done. Why would you make a new flag ship phone, if you have to make compromises? The flag ship is suppose to be the best in every single way, just the perfect one, which this one isn't.One more thing which I don't like is the construction. I am not a iPhone fan, but the way they made the iPhone 5 is just outstanding. The body is very well made with strong construction, it feels expensive when you hold it. The Galaxy Note 2 feels very fragile, I can't even put on a table, because I am afraid I'll scratch the back. And my biggest fear is that I'll break the back in half when taking it of to change mu SIM card or memory card. I think Samsung made too many sacrifices to make the body slim and light, which is not acceptable for the flash ship phone.","January 7, 2013",0
mobile phone,Amazing phone - but where's the MEMORY?,Ruby K Adkins,R1DHX7GGTN3QJO,3,"I got this on a carrier for the two week ""trial"" and I'm going to return it. I work with film (digital), and 3D modeling applications. The OS is amazing, the phone/phablet is NEARLY flawless, and I love it's cutting edge performance. I want this beauty so badly but a 16GB internal memory isn't going to cut it for me. This phone/phablet is meant to replace a laptop, camera, sketchbook and WAS going to be my mobile workstation. With all that capability you'd think they'd release this phone with a 32GB and 64GB option at the same time on all the carriers. I've scoured the internet and no one at the stores can give me a straight answer about the memory options and if/when they'll be available. It's so frustrating to finally find the phone/phablet that's practically perfect in nearly every way - except skimpy on memory for it's abilities. If I'm going to have it for two years the minimum I'd buy is a 32GB model. C'mon where are the bigger memory options for this thing? They are keeping people like me from committing! While I realize you can buy a memory card (I'll be getting one too) my issue is that if I'm going to use it for two years on contract I don't want to have to pick and choose what to load on the phone or worry about storing more on the card than phablet/phone itself especially since I intend to wear out all those useful features. I want to show people what I'm working on now and on projects I've done in the past - or show them my 3D models. That all takes up memory and instead of waiting on an iffy connection it makes sense to have what you need with you period. I say go big or go home and I want a to use this beauty to it's full potential and test the limits to see just how much it can really handle.That being said I have to ask why they won't release the other memory option models with such an amazing OS and phablet/phone. I think it's time we all pester Samsung about this. If they can release this overseas with all the memory options why won't they do that here in the US with such a massive market? The iPhone 5 has all three available, the S III launched the same as have many others so why the rub on this beast of a phablet/phone? Another thing to think about is what if they are holding out for the annoying Black Friday or Cyber Monday? I don't want to commit only to find out I could've gotten the model I REALLY wanted if I had waited two more weeks or a month. That's happened to me before so I'd like to not have to deal with it again. Has anyone else experienced that frustration? ""If only I'd waited another two weeks!""That being said my ONLY complaint (I'm talking to you Samsung)is that for such a gorgeous beast of a tool you don't seem too concerned about not offering the 32GB and 64GB options for this market. Don't keep people like me waiting too long or I'll go elsewhere - to a competitor.","November 8, 2012",0
mobile phone,Going back to my antiquated flip phone,Robin B.,R2KAFITWOLS3AI,3,"I upgraded to this phone from my original LG Flip phone. I got a better price though amazon than Tracfone. I've been using it for a couple of months and am generally happy with it. It is not a smartphone, so don't buy it thinking you are getting one. But if you want a phone for basic calling and texting functions, I think you will like this LG. The texting screen is easier to see than my flip phone. The touch screen takes some getting used to, but now I don't have any problems with it. One thing I don't like is when you get a call, you have to handle it carefully by the sides of the phone or else you will inadvertently answer, reject or ignore a call. This isn't easy when digging the phone out of a purse. I have had Tracfone service for two years now and would NEVER go back to the larger service providers. My one negative comment is why can't they include an instruction manual with electronics anymore? It would be so much more helpful if they did and I might be more proficient at using all the features.Update: I have had the phone for about six months. Yesterday, I had three ""dropped"" calls. This usually occurs if I am in a car or otherwise walking around (one time it happened three times in my home when I walked into a particular room). I NEVER had a dropped call with my antiquated LG Flip phone. Also, I have a vacation home in a somewhat rural area, and I cannot seem to get service there with this phone. I was able to get service with my old LG flip phone, but not this one. I do like certain features of this phone (the screen is easy to read, texting is easy with the keyboard), but the dropped calls and dead zones for service are a little too aggravating.","May 15, 2013",0

Keeps losing about 4 minutes a day although the phone isn't being used. No way to track where time went either, keeps records on phone calls but not data use. I don't use the data knowingly, but that's the only place I can guess the minutes go. Takes off a few seconds at a time several times a day.

This absence of the ability to make a call for an extended period of time, is a serious problem. I'm not sure what I would do if my house was on fire or I had an emergency. I have contacted their service department and got suggestions about ""bar"" available, but that doesn't seem to be the problem. I suspect that the available phone ""lines"" are full and you have to wait in line. So, you might need a back-up in case of emergencies.","May 4, 2014",0

mobile phone,$100 of Minutes wiped out!,K. Mitchell,R3OFILKIEMYM9B,3,UPDATE: After spending all day corresponding with the Tracfone representatives at the site tracfoneforum.com I was finally able to get the minutes added to my phone. I wasted a lot of time for something that should have taken 5 minutes but at least I was able to get what I paid for. If you run into problems when you call the company directly I highly recommend that you go to the website and try to get your issue resolved there.ORIGINAL REVIEW:I received my phone and minutes yesterday. After getting the phone activated I had the representative add the minutes to my phone. They confirmed that the minutes were added to my account but I didn't see it reflect on my phone. I was told to wait an hour and check again. By that time nothing had changed and my phone still only reflected 1 minute and 40 seconds which is what was left from the free 10 minutes the phone starts out with. I tried calling them to find out what went wrong but at this point they were closed. I also kept getting text messages from them all night long telling me to call customer service to complete the transaction. This morning I called them and told them about the text messages. She asked what I was trying to do and I explained that the phone was working properly but my minutes haven't been updated. She checked and said that she shows the minutes were added to the phone and that I must have used them all up. At this point I'm in shock. How in the world did I use up 24+ hours of minutes (440 x 3 + 250 bonus minutes) in less than a 24 hour time frame? Keep in mind I didn't call anyone except Tracfone to activate the phone. I also didn't use any browser or anything else for that matter. So basically I'm out $100 for nothing! I asked them to show me what used up the minutes and I was told to call back in 72 hours because they won't have that information until then. So far no good. It's a shame because I've only heard good things about Tracfone until now.,"May 23, 2013",0

mobile phone,Music Player moves at GLACIAL speed,Zachary A. Rose,R14PJ7SU5JF4S4,3,"To start off, I cannot speak to the call quality / service of this phone. I bought it to use as a cheap MP3 player along with a 16 Gigabyte micro SD card.Initially I loaded music on the 2 gigabyte card that the phone came with and it worked perfectly.Unfortunately when I replaced the 2 gigabyte card with a 16 gigabyte card the music player began moving at a GLACIAL speed. I would press a button and wait 10-20 seconds for the phone to responds. In the meantime if I had pressed the button twice the phone registered both button presses and would take me through two menus instead of the one I was trying.Basically, if you want to use this as an inexpensive music player, you're out of luck as its practically unusable.Otherwise the phone seems pretty good for the price, the touch screen is responsive and the menu is fairly intuitive.

Walmart people put me on network with know problem with my old number and I went home. A call from home and wifes cell confirmed input to the new phone. Now I wanted to put contacts and such into the phone. # one problem, there were no directions to input such information. I assume that LG and the provider thinks that everyone now days can just look at the touch screen and know how to go up and down and left and right to access info from this to that. However when the first direction for adding a contact was for a picture I was dumbfounded and taken aback to go further. Why does the first contact screen ask for a photo and not the intended Place and # and ask for personnel info later, WHAT A PAIN.What the first page SHOULD ask for is who, and number and THEN if I want to add more make Edit available to the contact.LG and providers should put out DIRECTIONS for the use of their system and phones, I,m learning the hard way and the phone may deserve 5 stars but so far trying to use it deserves 3 or less.By the way, no minutes came with this phone and I needed to buy a phone card on top of the cost of the phone.","October 21, 2012",0

It has a Russian app, so maybe it was manufactured in Russia. Samsung advised finding out, said it is not U.S. made, but seller said they did not understand the question (??)

Some American carriers operate on 1900MHz and some Latin American ones, on 2100MHz, but this only means that depending on the specific country or on the specific city, one may found himself with 2G data only if one's not lucky.Getting an European phone that doesn't support the five 3G bands (850, 900, 1700, 1900, 2100MHz) used worldwide is asking for disappointment.","September 26, 2013",0

mobile phone,"""Perfect"" size",Neur0n,R1ZIBHQ3RLSXMQ,3,"I bought this phone because I wanted a somewhat high end phone that is shaped and sized to what I wanted. The size of this phone seems ""perfect"" in my hands and I can use it with just one hand. The screen looks vibrant and everything runs smoothly (so far). I feel that this phone is more aesthetic than the bigger Galaxy SIII simply because it's smaller. However I should note that the bigger Galaxy SIII has better specs than the miniature version. I also liked that it's compatible with T-mobile.However I experienced massive delays on this phone that I haven't with other phones. I don't think the phone is slow, and It's also not a T-mobile's network issue. I'm thinking it has to do with the antennae or compatibility issues with the phone itself. Whenever I go inside a building, I lose connection in most buildings. I did not lose connection with my other Nokia phone using the same network. Additionally there would be times the bars in the same spot would randomly go up and down for no apparent reason - meaning that sometimes in the same spot (for example my room) I could make calls or I can't make calls at all. However my Nokia had no issues. So I concluded that it has something to do with the phone. With that said, it works with T-mobile most of the time, but I found those issues to be an annoyance.Overall It's hard to say whether or not this phone is worth it because from what I been reading, it seems to be a location issue. So some places it might work just fine while other places it won't. Assuming that you don't have the delay issue that I do, then this phone is definitely solid. Although it's quickly getting outdated with new phones coming out with high end quad cores and 13mp cameras.","April 23, 2013",0

mobile phone,I Should Have Followed My Gut,"Thelma Talbert ""Thelma T""",R2HS3NQ22SY5E1,3,"In June 2013, I decided to do an upgrade on my Samsung Transform Ultra. My first choice was the Samsung Galaxy II, but instead I decided to try and save a few bucks and I purchased the LG Venice. Mistake. At first I loved the phone, then I started noticing things about this phone I didn't like. First off, the back camera on this phone is excellent. The front camera is a piece of crap. My old Transform Ultra front camera was ten times better. Then I noticed when the phone did a media scan, it took a looong time, and your gallery, videos, and camera would be tied up. Also, when I got the phone I found out an upgrade to jelly bean was available. I did the update and the phone became way slower. I experienced dropped calls, it takes a long time for the phone to respond when you try to make calls. there is no light to let you know your phone is completely charged,it freezes. Many times the alarm won't sound if you set it, the keyboard is slow, and it will also turn itself off. I know now that I should have spent the extra money to get the Samsung Galaxy. I can't wait to get another phone.'Update:This piece of crap phone has gotten worse. Now I can barely hear callers, it drops calls, the icon you touch isn't the app that opens.So frustrated. YouTube will not work at all. If you want to watch a video you have download it too watch it. Only get this phone if you want to.talk and text. Forget about anything else.","January 8, 2014",0
mobile phone,I'M NOT TOO CRAZY ABOUT IT,Bruce from BK,RURCRVSMEI24S,3,"I bought this phone from HSN and at first thought it was really cool because of the Front Facing camera, and lite body style, but the swipe response time is not as fast I thought it would be. Another MAJOR ISSUE WITH THIS PHONE, this will make you hate this phone. This phone automatically switches into Wi-Fi mode wether you want it too not, wether the signal is strong or not. The problem this causes is that if you attempt to make a phone call, it will take a long time to go through, the other is that you will not be able to access the internet, and also the Google Talk commands will not work. You will find yourself consistently switching from the on Wi-Fi Mode to the Off Wi-Fi Mode. The internal memory also doesn't hold much. If you can see yourself around these things, it does take nice pics and its ok. IF I HAVE OTHER CHOICES MONEY WISE, I WOULD STRONGLY CONSIDER SOMETHING ELSE.","November 24, 2013",0
mobile phone,"UPDATED review (Liked it at first, now I wish I had an iPhone)",TheRealMulan,RYA321XQKYK2N,3,"My biggest frustration is with phone call and voice mail quality....it's terrible. I usually can't make or receive calls in my house (I live in the San Francisco Bay Area, so this SHOULD not be a problem). I have to go outside or sit in my car to talk. When I am connected, I often can't hear the other person. Voicemail messages are the WORST, not crisp and clear. A few times I couldn't decipher what the other party said at all. My low quality non-smart Motorola had way better sound quality.Battery runs down FAST when I'm out and about using my DATA.When I can afford the higher contract rates, I will buy a Samsung or iPhone.----------------------------------------------------------------------------Original review:This is my first smartphone, so I can't fairly compare it to other phones, but I am content. It's a fun first phone.Only cons so far...Not very fast, but then again it's not 4G.Screen touch too sensitive.

mobile phone,I'm not that impressed!!,Hischild,R28HWBXZOFO3X1,3,"I've only had this phone for a few months now. It was supposed to be an upgrade.

mobile phone,LG Venice-Meh,Lori Jalbert,R2RA7GNYLV6KJK,3,"I purchased the LG Venice about a month ago. When the phone arrived I was pleased with the way it looked; it was thin and light weight.

I check facebook, text and make calls, still the phone freezes up A LOT, the screen will go blank when I click on an icon such a ""contacts"", then I will have to back out and try again. Overall, it is an OK phone, but no better than the ZTE that I had for two years. The LG Venice is working to the capacity of my old phone that I had for years and began to act up. I worry that since I'm already having issues that I will be purchasing another phone soon due to the issues I am having.","October 22, 2013",0

mobile phone,Charging problems and other issues,Anna,R1I8W8Y996CSKD,3,"I had to return this phone: big disappointment since I love its size, interface, and speed. Two days after I received the phone, the wall charger stopped charging. The charger that came with the phone was cheap looking and the micro USB was already slightly loose before it stopped charging. I tried several wall chargers, but these phones expect some fairly specific chargers. After several attempts, I succeeded in getting it charged using an iphone wall charging block and a Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1 charger. Then more charging problems appeared: the battery would not fully charge even letting it charge overnight night (it would reach 86-87% maximum); the phone would discharge rapidly with modest use (email reading, a couple of phone calls/text messages) even with power saving mode on and terminating applications often. Final problem: as I heard that upgrading to firmware 1.4.2 may help with the charging issues, I tried to update it using Kies. Kies would not even recognize it as a Samsung phone. I tried various versions of Kies, with no success. It seems like this phone cannot be upgraded in the US unless you do in an unofficial way. At the end I gave up: too many issues; I could not trust this phone to last any reasonable length of time.","October 14, 2013",0
mobile phone,New to Android!,Karthik,RFU5W4Q8QYA5H,3,"Its okay considering I'm new to the Androis OS. Using the Apple products all along. Bought this one for a change. Some things I didn't like was that the OS itself took up half of the internal memory )out of 8GB only 4GB is usable). Also, find it strange to not easily be able to save picutres from phone memory to SD card. I took some pictures thinking that it got saved, but it went nowhere since the internal memory was full. I would have expected it to save it to the SD card. Anyway have to plough thru some learning curve. Overall, I like my iPhone better than the Samsung Galaxy SIII Mini.","October 2, 2013",0

mobile phone,Surely not as good as iphone,flowtown,R2USPOQ6KESSXB,3,"Bought this together with a iPhone 4 so I can compare side by side which is better. The screen size is actually than iphone4 . However there are some downsides that seriously negatively affect my scoring on this item. The charger is the most stupid one I have ever seen, it plugs into an adaptor and then another adaptor before it is able to plug into a power outlet. The stacking of adapters not only looks awful but very inefficient as well , it disconnects from power from time to time during charging. Several times I charged this phone overnight but only got 10% charged! The seller tried to help me with a replacement charger, but it does not well either. The second drawback is its typing input. Other devices wll let you know which letter you touched and selected from the tiny pop out keyboard but galaxy mini does not .this is particularly annoying when typing passwords that the screen does not display the letters you typed. Except the above , this device is good.After writing the review above, one commented that it's stupid to give a low rate just because of its charger. The problem is more than the charger, it's design needs to improve as well. The on/off button on the side is so protruding that it's very easy to accidentally touch the button and uneventfully close the screen you are watching or working on. Because it happened so frequently to me( I believe same to other users t) compared to my iPhone 4, I tend to like more of my iPhone 4 and dislike this mini .Now the price is again dropped another $50, it's not too bad to buy it compared to unchanged iPhone.","April 17, 2013",0

mobile phone,"Good phone, but shortcomings in maps and music apps",funktion,R1OHB4G44F7H14,3,"While most critiques about the Lumia 920 keep talking ad nauseum about the size, weight and lack of apps, I wonder how many of these reviewers are actually spending time with the phone to see how it adds value in everyday situations. For example, I use my phone primarily to find my way around town, and for listening to a lot of music. I think the Lumia 920 is the most high quality and gorgeous looking mobile device ever made, and I actually love the size and weight -- it's a joy to hold and use. That said, I found the Windows Phone 8 OS lacking in features I've so far taken for granted on other phones. For me, the following inadequacies mar what could otherwise be a great phone,1) Nokia Maps needs to have more data and be more polymorphic. I could type the name of a place in the ""To:"" field in Google Maps, and it will most likely find the place and give me directions. This is not the case on the Windows Phone. For example, in San Francisco, try typing ""The Sycamore"" (a popular bar in the Mission District).2) Nokia Maps mustn't be a world unto itself. When I click on an address in an E-mail, I'm not sure why it opens in ""Windows Maps"". This is far inferior to Nokia Maps (it has no public transit directions), and I have no way of changing the default application to open addresses.3) Nokia Maps and Transit must be consolidated -- accessing two different apps to find directions makes no sense at all.4) Nokia Maps (or Navigator) must provide an option to access alternate routes. We're given only one route for driving (or walking) but I'm sure a lot of the time, the user wants to use an alternate freeway (or road).5) Xbox Music is very unimpressive as a native music player. There's no way to rewind/forward elegantly (a slider here would be great, I can't go back to holding down buttons!). The Nokia Music app doesn't even have rewind/forward capability.6) Given that the Lumia has a gorgeous big screen, it's a pity that I can't see my album art in full screen -- in the player, or when my screen is locked. Apparently the album art only loads on the lock screen if you buy the songs from XBox music. It doesn't work even if you update the album art in Windows Media player.7) The music streaming options are very limited for the Windows Phone 8. SkyMusic and SkyDrive are quite lacking when compared to Amazon Cloud player or Google Play. SkyDrive doesn't even run as a background app, and stops playing music when you go back to the home screen!","November 19, 2012",0
mobile phone,BEWARE Data usage!,"Doda McCheesle ""Doda""",RPR7H3GO8W7K4,3,"Greetings... I purchased one of these from AT&T; in December, and gave it a whirl. I had similar problems to many others:1) Poor battery life- I need a charger at home and work, as the thing could not make it all day2) Gets hot during use, especially video use3) OUTRAGEOUS and totally inexplicable data usage. THIS IS MY #1 PROBLEM with the Lumia 920...After complaining to AT&T;, they swapped out one 920 for a new one. The same problems persisted. After speaking with both AT&T; techs (on-line and in AT&T; service store), as well as contacting Nokia, I could not get the problems resolved, particularly any explanation for the CRAZY data usage. The thing sits on my desk most of the day, on my company Wi-Fi, and at home it is on Wi-Fi. It is NOT supposed to use up your data plan while on wi-fi-- however, I would get bills from AT&T; showing as much as 11 GIGAbytes of use in 1 month. And here's the deal-- after speaking with AT&T;, Nokia, and reading on various web sites, I disabled or removed every application anyone could think of that used data (other than Internet explorer and email). No Facebook. No ""live"" tiles. No maps. No Nokia Driving app. No backups or photos/vids to Skydrive. No weather app. etc. etc. But AT&T; still claimed seeing data ""bursts"" and spikes throughout the day of sometimes 80Mb... they could not explain any of these bursts (especially since I was supposed to be on Wi-Fi) and quickly refunded ALL of the overage charges on my account for 3 months...which in itself is suspicious (you ever try getting a refund from a phone company?)...Anyway, I finally got AT&T; to swap the Nokia Lumia 920 for a Samsung Galaxy S III- which includes a ""data usage"" application... and in one week of having the Galaxy it has used less data than one day of the Lumia 920. With the same email accounts configured. And usings the Samsung data use app, I could see that one 4 minute YouTube video used about 50Mb of data, and email uses very little. So it appears to me that both Lumia 920's that I had were in some way ""defective"".I liked the device in terms of appearance, apps, ease of use-- the Windows 8 was pretty nice, the screen is beautiful, and it otherwise worked well. However, I can't afford to hand AT&T; $110/month in overage fees for data I don't choose to use. And a 4 - 6 hour battery life on a device with this large a battery is also pretty unacceptable. Oh well Nokia-- this is called by some your ""last chance"" gadget. Maybe it's your last gasp...If Nokia acknowledges issues and FIXES THEM, either via software updates, or replacing hardware, this would be a 5 star device. As it is in my experience, I give it 3 stars because not everyone appears to be having the issues I had, and the problems MAY be resolvable by future updates.","March 28, 2013",0
mobile phone,a 70% solution,pjm,R1P5PJT4RVYLZI,3,"I purchased this w/ no contract to replace my Zombie Phone (AT&T; Go Phone), Garmin Oregon 550, and Zune HD.The only one I can say it truly replaces is the phone witch surprised me. Contrary to AT&T; web site the 920 DOES support Go Phone Service.Replacing the Garmin fall under the ""There is an App of that"" category. Well its not 1 its more like 6 and it still is missing functionality. I was not expecting everything but the lack of communication between apps is frustrating. Ex Why do I need to download maps for every app? How can I transfer a waypoint from one app to another? (use a geocache from Geocaching Live in Nokia Drive. I do off-road on-road nav switching all the time on the Garmin) The camera in the 920 is far and away better than the 550's camera.Replacing the Zune HD you would think would be a slam dunk for any WP8 device. NOT. MS totally messed up the music syncing. You can not upload any of the Xbox Music Pass you have in Playlists etc. on to the device. And the down sampling function is gone. I have not checked but I would be surprised if the music rating, play count, etc. syncs back to the PC. I have resorted to Media Monkey for syncing since it is better than the MS option.WP8 is pretty quick to pickup and use. Can't stand the email function. I read an email on the PC and the phone does not see it was opened, making me read/touch the email twice. It's probably an IMAP/POP limitation or something in Thunderbird but it is still annoying.For now my Garmin Oregon 550 and Zune HD are still going to be my devices of choice.","February 2, 2013",0
mobile phone,"Before buying it, read all the negatives!",Falling Maple,REBT0BUQP6A99,3,"I wanted to switch to Nokia Lumia 920 from iphone, was religiously waiting for it despite iphone 5 announced later but available earlier. But, now I am at times wonder about my decision. Here I am writing as someone who is working (meaning I can't be bother with apps like angry bird etc....) and not techies who like to control every details of phone usage, down to memory. I just want to use the phone for a couple purposes, make phone calls, read/edit ppt, doc easily, can check restaurants review using yelp when I am out, airlines app when I travel, texting, calendar that syn properly ...Many can talk about the pros, but here are the cons I have encountered after some use:1. Apps: I'm not crazy about apps but only need a few one that I would use smart phone for. - No UA travel apps or triptracker. UA is the big business travel airline. Huge negative for me. I don't like tripit that grab stuff from email. - Yelp. No bookmark or log-in. Half-baked app. - Line/viber, no voice call and no magic jack. - no expedia - no Wellsfargo, may only affect west coast - adding some appointments to the calendar from website, eg. Alaska airlines, doesn't seem to work properly. But, the phone is amazingly integrated with facebook/linkedin. But, that's not the primary use of the phone for me.2. Search *button* at bottom right. When you try to use the phone with one hand, you keep touching the search accidentally, then Bing would pop up while you are in the middle of something else. Very annoying.3. Text input. I find typing a little bit harder than iphone, maybe the sensitivity. iPhone tends to over-correct spelling and Window phone under correct. Too many typos texting as a result. Other language inputs like Chinese, Japanese are not ideal.4. Battery life. The battery life is horrible sometimes. Died before I came home. Definitely not as long as iPhone. I have a long train ride. The unreliable battery life is inconvenient esp I used it as a hotspot for my iPad. Seriously considering re-activating my iPad data plan.5. In regards to the well-integrated with Facebook, you could easily post something like photo unitntentionally as u do not need Facebook app for status update.Conclusion, I wouldn't say that I regret buying it but I would probably not buy it if I don't have iPad with LTE option.Microsoft needs to improve user experience and Nokia needs to improve the battery life.Yen Lin","January 19, 2013",0
mobile phone,Still falls short of expectations,dudeonmoon,R1W5CB39ZE50ZE,3,"Thought I'd give the Lumia 920 an earnest try when it came out... waited for months after the initial preview of the 920 without any specs, and also resisted the urge to buy the iphone 5 (was using 3gs at the time, and it was getting slow).Well guess what, bought the lumia 920, felt good for a day or two, but then started seeing some glaring omissions from windows phone 8 OS. And no, I am not talking about Apps not being available on the marketplace and all that.... simple things are missing in WP8, or they are there but there is no easy way to know about them. For example, on iOS, it is very easy to tap on a block of text and choose ""Select All"" to select all text and just plain delete it. Helps on address bars on webpages, emails that you want to delete stuff from and a lot more things. I could not for the life of me find a way to do that on WP8. The only option is to select a word, then drag the selectors to the beginning and the end, and basically forget what you were trying to do in the first place.Another example is Nokia Drive. While touted as excellent with offline capabilities and accurate GPS, I could not find a way to simply choose a different route. On iOS and Android, the maps present several alternate routes that one can choose from, so if I need to drive along a specific route I can do that. The navigation voice-over is also sub-par because it does not call out the names of roads all the time. Half the time, it would tell me to take a turn on [insert name of road] road, while the other half - it would just ask me to take a right. That is not acceptable today. Both iOS (even though map search sucks, the navigation UI and guidance itself is excellent) and google offer literally hands-free and eyes-free navigation, where I could keep my phone in the cup-holder or on bluetooth and it would literally tell me which road to take and what turns to make. I could not do that on the Nokia 920.Lastly, what is the deal with Microsoft's insistence of combining everything into my hotmail or windows live account, which I never used before, and dont ever plan on using? Sure, Apple has their iCloud account which you have to use, but your phone contacts stay as your phone contacts. The moment I setup my Lumia 920, all my contacts became hotmail or live contacts, and it merged my facebook contacts with rest of them. I know there is a way to filter how contacts are shown, it still very very annoying to have 2-4 entries of the same people (their different accounts) and then having to sift through all that.WP8 is great, but it has some omissions that only show up when you start using the OS. Microsoft cannot expect us to use it just because it has live tiles - it should have all the necessary features that are present in all the modern mobile OSs.Returned it after a week of using, bought the iphone 5, and not looking back till next round of cell-phone upgrades","December 3, 2012",0
mobile phone,"Great hardware, half-baked OS",EditedName,R164TJR92KKB83,3,"Wow, the number of 5-star reviews for this product is kind of over-the-top, and has prompted me to write my first phone review.I have been an Android user since I first started using smartphones, but after playing around with someone's Windows Phone 7 I was excited about the prospect of moving to a new, fresh smartphone experience.Long story short, I upgraded on AT&T; and got the WP8 with the most buzz, the Nokia Lumia 920. Just a few days later I was returning it and going back to Android. Here's why.The GoodHardware. This phone is a thing of beauty. It is actually what made me most reluctant to return it, as it felt like a really solid, wonderfully constructed piece of hardware, likely to last as long as I didn't flush it down the toilet.Yes, as the reviews all mention, it's heavier than other smartphones, but I didn't notice this even upon first picking it up. Only on direct comparison with my old phone did I feel the difference. My conclusion is that most people are weaklings.Windows 8 (partially). If you've owned an Android or iPhone, which is based mostly on a grid of icons, the experience you'll get using Windows Phone is very different, but live tiles are really cool and better for what they do than Android widgets or iPhone badges. They almost make up for the lack of a notification center (see below). Pinning apps to the home screen and resizing them was a fairly painless experience.The experience is smooth. In the few days I owned the 920, I did not experience any lag, stuttering, etc.The touch keyboard is fantastic! The best part was the prediction, which seems to work better than any Android keyboard I've used, including Swiftkey.The BadPush Notifications. You know, these are notifications of incoming texts, emails, etc. For stock apps they worked okay, but for anything else they were iffy, to say the least. I downloaded a couple apps, like a messaging client, that would sometimes notify me of an incoming message several minutes after I saw it on my computer, or often as not never beep at all. This, perhaps more than anything else, made using this phone painful. I could not depend on it to notify me of things.Notification Center. On a related but separate point... The Android notification center is simply awesome. The one for iOS (e.g. iPhone) isn't as good, and frankly not as necessary. But it seems like it is really indispensable for Windows Phone. Why? Because if you don't have an app pinned to the home screen, then you'll never see a notification. You can hear a beep and never know what it was for if that app isn't pinned to the home screen. Microsoft has said they'll fix this oversight, but that is possibly some months in the future.Apps. I don't need that many apps, but the WP Store is pretty barren compared to the other two major platforms. I shouldn't really complain about this, as I knew it was the case going in, but it's something to be noted.Other issues. I have several minor complaints here, about the phone freezing (which seems to be a widespread problem with all new WP8 phones, though I'm sure it will be fixed in an update), wifi disconnecting, and Internet Explorer not rendering pages correctly.Furthermore, the stock Weather app would not finish downloading an update and wouldn't open after that, meaning I had no way of knowing the weather without downloading a third party app or going online. That's pretty ridiculous if you ask me. Evernote worked for a few hours, then starting crashing. I didn't have the phone long enough to see problems appear with other apps.Battery Life. [Removed based on a comment, see below.]VerdictIf you have never owned a smartphone before, you will probably love this phone. If you're willing to overlook its shortcomings, or if they are addressed in the months after I write this review, you will probably love this phone. Speaking for myself, my brief experiment with Windows Phone 8 didn't work out for me, and I went fleeing back to the familiar arms of Android.If I were rating this phone strictly on the physical components and their integration with the OS, I would give it four stars (almost perfect). But a half-baked OS that is often a struggle to use knocks it down to three.","November 20, 2012",0

mobile phone,Text message issues on T-mobile,Matt,RWI197BTQU08N,3,"Bought the 8GB unlocked Nexus 4. Activated it with T-Mobile. Phone worked great except it had problems receiving text messages. Friends would text me but the phone never received them. Tried a new sim card but that didn't seem to help. Took it to the T-Mobile store and they didn't know what else to do other then switching out the sim card and playing with a few settings. Nothing seemed to work. Switched to a galaxy s 3 and love it.A couple other points I will make. I bought the phone for my wife, but the stock android on the nexus 4 certainly isn't as refined or pretty as the customized Android you find on the GS3 for example. So for hardcore users, the stock android experience is probably fine, even desirable, but for my wife she hated it because it wasn't as user friendly for her. Got her a GS3 instead as well.Price is certainly right for the Nexus 4 and no contract with T-Mobile is the bomb.Technically, the nexus 4 is capable of 4G LTE on T-Mobile but you need to root your phone and install a developer's OS and change your radio settings. But it works if you are technically savvy. Many articles on developer websites on how to do this. However most people, don't have the knowledge to do this and frankly the jump in speed from HSPA+ to LTE isn't all that meaningful for your every day user.","June 11, 2013",0
mobile phone,"Good phone, but a few downsides that cannot be overlooked",matt kramer,RYJB6LIV94WUZ,3,"First of all I would say the phone is 3.5/5. Overall the quality of the phone and pure android experience is what makes this phone so appealing. The specs are great and the phone feels excellent in hand. Also, wireless charging is a major plus, but the positives stop there.The battery life on this thing is just flat out bad. 4.2.2 did help it out tremendously, but it still is by no means good. I would be shocked if anyone other than an extremely light user gets through an entire day. I would put the battery on par with an iPhone 4s. Secondly, the camera is barely passable. The shutter speed is slow and taking low light photos, forget it. Another major draw back is the on screen buttons. This sounds great in theory; However, it really makes a 4.7"" screen closer to 4.3."" That may not sound like a big deal on paper, but in every day usability it is very noticeable.In conclusion, the phone is great for the price. There are unfortunately a few shortcomings that make the phone not worth it for me personally. Maybe the Nexus 5 will get it right. I didn't comment on the lack of Lte because that is known from purchase point and being an international phone it is not surprising. Fix the camera and battery and it would be a 5/5.","March 2, 2013",0
mobile phone,Disappointing,"Dejan Deh ""ddeh""",R2MV9O5Y7VEMTM,3,"Love google products, but they are generally not user friendly and glitchy.Phone performs great, no hangups, great clarity... love the free features including the included inductive charging... BUTBattery life is mediocre at best, OS is nice but not intuitive (I think they are trying to avoid patent fights at the expense of use experience).The screenshot feature is HORRIBLE in this version (i had two previous nexuses).Positioning of the powr/volume buttons makes you press the wrong thing quite often.It is very fragile... I dropped it from 3 feet (car seat) and the back cracked -- reminds me of apple greed (repairs).All in all, an OK phone, especially for $300, but don't expect too much.

I've had it for about 2 weeks now, and the only major concern I have is that the phone powers off randomly it seems (happened twice so far). Holding the power button for a long time without having the charger plugged in, and then connecting the phone to the charger seems to circumvent the problem. NOT waking up to an important meeting because the alarm didnt go off -- not something circumvented as easily.

mobile phone,"I Like it But, I don't know if I love it...",Perry,R2AP454YTE8XU9,3,"I have to warn you that I am a fan of Pure Android, I don't feel there is a better Mobile OS out at this time as most lack some features that Android clearly has. With that out of the way, let me say I've been using this phone for about 3 days now as I managed to score one when they went back in stock on the play store.BUILD QUALITY The phone itself seems very solid, It features a rubberize metal frame with Gorilla Glass 2 front and back plates. The phone is built much like the iPhone 4 and 4s line and like those phones the Nexus 4 also features a non-removable battery. No real complaints over all with the build quality.SPECIAL FEATURES The three biggest features the phone adds, in my opinion, are NFC with Google Wallet support, Wireless Charging, and Wireless display / Mirracast (this might be the first Google Device with Airplay style Screen Redirection).Google claims that 200,000 locations are now equipped with NFC (Near Field Communication) and setup to use their wallet for payment services. I haven't seen one yet but, I haven't really activated Google Wallet yet either.Wireless Charging is really cool but, as of right now the optional accessories required for the feature are pretty pricey and I cannot see myself spending $70+ for a piece of hardware to charge my phone when I have the plug that came with it for free. I might consider buying a few of these if they were say, $30 each.Wireless display has been around awhile and the Android version is Mirracast, this is cool and it is an open standard so more devices than just Google TV will support it. This will be really cool in the future but, right now it is a work in progress.DISPLAY I am not somebody who felt that the iPhone display was the best on the market, as it clearly was not and hasn't been in some time... With that said, this phone again took a page from Apple's book as LG went with a 300+ PPI, IPS based Display. After using AMOLED for the past several years, I'm honestly disappointed in the Display. Yes the display is sharp, bright, and overall very nice. However, compared to AMOLED it has poor black levels, color saturation, and battery efficiency. To me, this is a step back from the Galaxy Nexus and it's a shame.PERFORMANCE This might be the only quad core S4 Krait based phone in North America (I cannot think of another at this time) and as a result, the CPUs are likely the fastest around (yes faster than the iPhone) but, the use of an Adreno 320 GPU makes it a decent performer but, not the best in terms of Graphics. Overall, a very smooth phone that will not have any issues running the latest apps and games but, it could have been better.NETWORK PERFORMANCE The Nexus 4 is an HSPA+42 GSM based phone and for what it is, the performance is great. HSPA+ is good but, it is no LTE so if that matters to you, then steer clear of the Nexus... For me, I use Net10 on the AT&T; Network and I really have no issues with the speed as long as I can have unlimited Data for a low fee. This is pretty much a wash until Carriers return unlimited data connections with LTE speeds.CAMERAS This is a tough one, I never really think much of the Video-Conference cameras as most get the job down pretty well and the Nexus is no exception. The actual still / video camera on the phone is another issue... I find the camera to be among the best in modest to bright sunlight but, less than ideal in lower light. Of course, just about everyone else has included some form of stabilization in their main cameras and this is sadly something the Nexus is lacking. Overall, they're very good cameras.SOUND Sound is solid and I have no complaints, I don't really see this as a strength or a weakness of this phone.BATTERY LIFE Wow, this is certainly not the strongest point for the phone! Out of the box, the phone might get you through 8 to 10 hours of heavy intermittent use but, it is not an all day beast by any means. I had to turn off Google's Maps and Latitude Service as that is a huge drain, it is like running Apple's find my phone with the phone reporting in every few minutes and of course turning off the GPS is a must as well. To me, knowing there are no battery cases, and knowing you have some pretty intensive features in the OS would make the non-removable battery a suspect decision. This might be the biggest weakness of the phone.SOFTWARE Android Jellybean is simply the best and most feature rich OS on the market and there's not much to add to that. The phone came unlocked and contract free so there's no skins or malware installed on the unit.Google Hangouts is far better than FaceTime as you can have 9 people on the same video chat at once.Google Maps trumps Apple Maps by a mile.Google Chrome much more feature rich than Safari.Mobile Hot spot, being an unlocked phone makes for an unlocked Hot Spot and that is a huge benefit of this handset.CONCLUSSION It is a nice phone but, I really hate that these companies are going so far after the iPhone features that they fail to exclude many of the weaknesses! Samsung was pretty bad at this but, at least they left most of it in software and adjusted for the hardware. With LG creating a phone that has a Glass front / back plate, a sealed battery, and an IPS Display just seems like they've included too many of the negatives of the iPhone and taken a the Nexus line a few steps back in some areas.Now, let me say I've only been using the phone for a few days but, this isn't my first smartphone. Do I like the phone? Yes, I like it a lot! Do I love the phone? I think it is too early to say, as there certainly are features that are problematic to me.","February 2, 2013",0
mobile phone,mediocre,D. Siddiqui,R2X79DW1K0HOLW,3,"** Bought directly from GoogleI have been using this phone for 6+ months now and I think you get what you pay for. Voice leakage during telephone conversations and a third-class camera are what killed it for me. I compared this phone to Galaxy S4 and the latter just blew it away... into very small pieces.For the price, it's a good phone. But my suggestion is to get top of the line Samsung or Apple, you won't have that awful feeling during a vacation that I wish I had a better camera or get embarrassed with awful voice quality.I could go on and on about the different bugs, especially with switching audio sinks (between bluetooth, headset, speaker...) or the inaccurate touchscreen that will drive you nuts but I will give it a rest.For the record I've probably got more perspective than most people posting here -- worked on Blackberry phones for a few years, have most of Apple products at home and have this guy as my primary phone along with two Android tablets (they are even worse) and a BB Playbook (a level above Android tablets).

mobile phone,"Don't buy it, save your money for Nexus 5",L. V. Lam,RM9XNEXTT30QS,3,"I just bought the Nexus 4 not too long ago, when it dropped it price. It was a very compelling to purchase. Figured, made in Korea, very good hardware for the money, stock android, which I like. The most desirable feature is Nexus is the first in line to get new android version, albeit sometimes buggy. Starting with the Nexus 5 however, everything changed. No longer the older Nexuses going to get new features. I just flashed the stock factory image and see how nothing really changes from the outside. All the new features on 4.4 remains exclusive for the Nexus 5 for now (very Apple-like now, as whenever Apple release a new iphone, all new features are on the new iphone, and older iphones receive the update but wont' get every features). This case, I don't think hardware is a problem as the Nexus 5 is very much nothing evolutionary to the Nexus 4. So what does this mean? Nexus line is no longer the best in android. Price is good, but there are always compromises to be made, such as no expansion in storage, camera is underwhelming relatively to the competitions. This is very sad as in the past, Nexus suppose to the first one to get everything push out by Google. Now there is that 18-months window too. This made Nexus line on par with other brand, even though other companies are so slow to push out updates. So, Nexus line is no longer the products as they were the past several years. From the looks of it, Google won't change how thing operate now, which is very disappointing, consider how thing were in the past several years. So now, beside the no expansion storage, Nexus line now has more compromises to be made. The biggest is you will receive updates but not every new features, and now, there is a window for when the updates will stop coming. I know, you can find ROM and whatnots from online but it's the changed in fundamental with the Nexus line that is disappointing. So go buy the Nexus 5 and avoid the Nexus 4, but similar to iphone now, buying the Nexus 5 knowing that coming next year, your phone will missing out new features and want to buy new phones because of that.","November 17, 2013",0

cameras,Better off with IS,"Chris ""Chris""",R1J58YKM9RZQ7E,3,"Just a few words on my first impression. The weight of autofocus lenses (at least my USM 28-105 3.5) makes for a challenging hold to maintain a rock-steady posture to take crisply sharp photos, especially at higher magnifications. I'm inclined to trade it in for an IS lense (yes, it is an additional $200+), but may be a virtual necessity. The extra cost in going SLR to me isn't worth comprising what your objective is in going from darn good point and shoot resolution (at least from my Olympus 4000)to the quality one expects from this upgrade. This rating doesn't reflect on the camera, just the photos taken without IS (yes, it is subjective). The camera itself has much potential.","June 11, 2006",1

After performing all the recommended tests & resets, it kept failing. I actually used the camera very little early on and, thus, forgot about the errors. Once I started using the camera regularly again and taking more still photos, I had run out of warranty coverage. So, it cost me a few hundred send the camera back to Canon to repair what was a manufacturing and/or chipset defect.Once the repair was made, the camera operated flawlessly and still does to this day. Although this model is no longer current, I wanted to add my review for anyone who might be trying to buy one used. Be aware that this model had known issues with freezing as I mentioned above.

So I called Canon and they have asked that I UPS (at my own cost) the camera to their repair facility and they will pay for shipping it back to me. so lets see how this works out.

Yes, you can use a 2GB SD card on this camera - I use one on mine though i must admit, even with my setting to get the highest precision pictures i never seem to use more than a GB before I want to download the pictures and label them and get prints ;-) but yeah, maybe in a longer vacation the 2 GB will be great! ;-)*****a second update on this. got the camera pic - repaired by canon factory services for free - excluding one way shipping cost. shipped - 1/20, accepted - 1/24, repaired and shipped back - 1/26, got it back - 1/30and loving the camera all over again and clicking a ton of baby pictures again ;-)","January 13, 2006",1

It took pictures that could be put in magazines, but then about 3 months ago I started getting the dreaded black screen.For awhile I could turn the camera off and back on and take a few pictures before the screen went black again, but now it has blacked out for good.I'm searching for a new camera, and I'm scared to buy another Canon because with all the people that has got the ""black"" screen this HAS to be an internal problem with the camera that Canon fails to acknowledge.","May 16, 2009",1
cameras,A good camera for the price,L. Ferron,R2U7KO5D2N9LQM,3,"I have been pretty happy with this camera. It was purchased as a replacement for my Canon A70 which, after about 7 years, was acting squirrelly and needed to be replaced. I wanted another Canon with higher resolution, a good heavy body and a better zoom than 3x. The S2 IS fit the bill. With a 12x zoom and 5MP resolution it takes wonderful shots.On the downside, I was hoping to use it to take pictures at my daughter's sporting events. Not professional pictures, but good pictures. The A70 did this well with it's ""action"" setting. That setting is not available on the S2 IS and is really worthless in action situations. I also have a bit of trouble with red-eye. Rather than multi-flashes (like many digitals) there is a red light that the subject looks at. Of course, this isn't a solution if you are taking candids.All in all, I have been satisfied with the camera once I learned to work within it's limitations.","January 3, 2007",1
cameras,"great camera, if you can get past canon's quality control issues",d,R31DP6BGAWWDGU,3,"for the first 3 weeks i had this camera, i was SO happy. absolutely stunning zoom, it totally opened up a new world of photography to me, could see things around me i'd never noticed before. but consider this:my second digital camera, beginning of 2004, was bought brand new, canon a60. (very first had been a nikon coolpix that got stolen stolen after 2 months.) within a year of having the canon a60, the purple distortion happened, rendering the camera completely useless. it'd never been dropped.i figured maybe i'd been a little rough with it, anyway, so i took a chance and bought, brand new, a canon a90. within 4 months, purple distortion starts taking over my photographs, and then it stops taking photos completely, screen black, camera dead.so i figure canon's a-series is the disposable line, and i need to move up to their more expensive cameras. so i spent $360 on a powershot s2 4 weeks ago.last week, i dropped it. onto soft grass. cursing myself, i looked at it, looked okay, took it home. tried to take a picture, purple distortion taking over my photos, absolute jagged mess.now i know i dropped the camera, but i'd inflicted far worse abuse on my nikon coolpix, and it'd never shown any problems. 3 canons now, in under 3 years, I've wasted close to $1000. every single one, the same problem, whether dropped or not.suffice it to say, i am not going to be buying a canon again.","May 24, 2006",1

cameras,"Good camera, significant limitations, next likely significantly better",Kevin K. Fosler,R27GU8Y9BA5JFC,3,"This is a rewrite of a previous review, hoping to be more concise.Pros:- Feels good, looks good, great ergonomics. Usually I de-emphasize this, but this is an exception.- The pictures turn out great.- The movie mode is awesome, good stereo sound (but see below under cons)- It is quick and responsive, for zoom and focus.- The rotating display is nice not only to take pictures of myself, but also to take closer pictures of other people in a candid way -- i.e. you won't be in their face with the camera obviously pointed towards the person.- Some scene modes on the selector dial which is convenient.- Flash doesn't automatically pop up. Most people see this as a disadvantage. I see it as a great advantage. If I don't want flash, I leave it down. It suggests using flash on the LCD. If I want to use the flash, I then flip it up.Cons:- Small 2"" LCD, plus inferior viewfinder. This is almost a show-stopper for me. This camera is basically an upgrade to the S2. Due to competition, the next version of this camera is likely to have a larger LCD. It depends on whether you need an ultra zoom camera now, vs. waiting for next spring.- There is no date stamp on the photos. This can be added using Canon's software according to their technical support.- Plastic camera tripod mount.- The movie mode produces really high quality videos. The problem is that they aren't compressed, or as compressed as other cameras. A movie can be only 1G, and only 8 minutes of video can fit on a 1G SD card.- Lack of scene modes.A comparison with the new Kodak p712.The new Kodak, also an upgrade (of the 850) now focused quickly and has best in class low shutter lag. I had the 850 and have the 712, and there is a big difference.The Kodak has better image stabilization.The Kodak has *many* scene modes. This helps the non-professional get the settings right.The quality of the images is about equal (other than the canon not being as good with image stabilization at maximum zoom).There are more options for flash typesThere are more buttons on the camera for faster settings.The LCD and quality viewfinder make the Kodak a more fun camera.The disadvantages of the Kodak over the S3, is that the Kodak doesn't have a rotating display, so photos of people could be more intrusive. The Kodak doesn't have the great feel or looks of the S3.I think that I will be rewarded if I wait for the next iteration of Canon's ultra zoom. With Kodak's larger display, Sony's 3"" display, Canon will have to make theirs bigger. A Canon with a larger display plus other improvements they may add would be my dream camera.I am not going to keep the Kodak p712 either. I love that camera, but I want a rotating display. Having tried the rotating display, I am hooked on it.","June 26, 2006",1
cameras,Almost Perfect!,Eric Hamilton,RTRIK7U793WJ8,3,"I've been using this camera for a few weeks now, and I've taken at least a thousand photographs with it. It is easily the most versatile piece of photographic equipment I have ever owned, and I grew up using film SLRs. This camera has almost all of the features I love in SLR cameras, including fairly intuitive control over exposure settings. I also love the video feature.My favorite features are:- The 12x zoom lens which can easily capture close-up subjects from the opposite side of a large room.- Super-macro mode shoots clear pictures less than an inch from the lens.- Excellent TV quality video with good stereo sound (no HD).- A variety of shooting modes let you capture a detailed close up in vivid color one moment, and a fast action shot seconds later with the turn of a dial.- Adjustable flash output.That said, there are a few things that really irritate me about this camera. For instance, the manual focus is a pain to use. Instead of twisting the lens, you are forced to hold down one button while you press up and down keys. Autofocus is essentially worthless when you combine low light and fast action (such as a lively concert, like the one I shot pictures at tonight). A usable manual focus is essential for any serious photographer!Another thing that bothers me is the lack of an external flash hook-up. It makes it difficult to avoid red-eye when photographing people in low light.I don't understand how such basic features were overlooked when this camera has everything else but the kitchen sink. While this is certainly the most versatile camera I've ever owned, and I love it for what it is, I would not buy it again. I would look for a similar camera that includes a twist-lens manual focus and a flash hot-shoe.One more critique - photographs are often unusably grainy with ISO settings at 400+. You'll want to stick to the 80 - 200 range, if you can. The lowest ISO setting possible for the situation will deliver the best image the camera is capable of.","September 30, 2006",1
cameras,Good camera... IF you don't wear glasses!,Jim Dee,RG1SZH6Q36FBG,3,"I've taken a couple of thousand pictures with this camera and the results are generally very good. One serious flaw, however, is its electronic viewfinder. I wear glasses and the viewfinder is difficult (sometimes VERY difficult) to see in many outdoor lighting situations. (Of course the LCD screen is equally useless in bright light). If I take off my glasses so my eye can fit snuggly against the viewfinder, the view is fine. But if you wear glasses for distance, you know that taking your glasses off each time you want to shoot is not a reasonable option. Of course, this is a problem with optical viewfinders, too, but the problem is not nearly as severe. So, I would strongly advise those who wear glasses to test the camera thoroughly in a variety of lighting conditions before buying.I will get to the good points in a moment, but another annoying, though not so serious, flaw is the setup for using shutter speed (and aperture) priority. The shutter speed is set using the four-way controller, located in the top right corner on the camera back. The problem here is that there is no way to select a shutter speed and lock it. Because of the position of the four-way controller, it is very easy to push it accidentally, while simply holding the camera between shots, which changes the shutter speed. This means being very careful how you hold the camera and checking the shutter speed before each shot to be sure it has not been changed. The shutter speed is displayed in the viewfinder, but the aforementioned problem with the viewfinder makes this problem doubly irritating for us glasses wearers.Having said all that, I still like this camera. It has great flexibility, and operations are fast, smooth and quiet. The pictures are excellent. The rotating LCD is very useful, allowing the camera to be placed in positions where using the viewfinder is impossible. The IS is helpful, though some physical stability (tripod, tree, post ..) is still needed at the longer end of the telephoto range. The flash is OK, though red eye is definitely a problem. I've experimented with a few of the special modes and some worked well, while others did not. Selecting setting manually is often better.There's a sizable learning curve with this camera, because of the numerous buttons, the many special shooting modes, and various options available. I still have much to understand, but the more I learn the more I like the camera, in spite of the problems discussed above.","August 3, 2006",1
cameras,"Does a pretty fair job, but not what I was hoping for",Chanda Marx,R37I0MLPXO1P4R,3,"I've had my camera for about 2 months now. A few points I must praise are the compact body, and super fast shutter speed (I've never owned a Digi Cam with such a quick shutter speed... very nice!) But I'm having some issues with the camera that I'm hoping to ""fix"" thru experimentation. These are to include;Trouble with focusing in low light conditions; shadowing on the super macro function; washed out background color (this applies only to my outdoor shots; indoor shots are fine, but my skies in all my outdoor pics are washed out to the point of being white, while the foreground and land in the same picture are almost over-saturated in color).Also, another downside is that you have to manually raise the flash when you need it. I've not found any instructions on a way to make it pop up automatically. This can be very frustrating when you don't think you need the flash, get your shot lined up, and then try to take the picture, only to get a flashing icon telling you to ""raise the flash"".I've pretty much only used Nikon in the past, and will most likely sell this camera and go back to the Nikon. However, the sharpness and vibrancy of the pictures used with this camera are quite good. I'm no pro, and I know that the user, not the camera, will dictate how good a final shot comes out, but I've not had these issues with my Nikon's, so I am not sure who is to blame for these issues. Canon is still a great company, and I think the majority of consumers will appreciate and enjoy the S3.","November 28, 2006",1
cameras,Great for Sunny Days,"Brian Bussey ""busseyb""",R3AEQI3960CK7Z,3,"I love the S3, it's a great camera but......the only issue (in my opinion) with the S3 is that it does not do well in low light and the pictures are a little too soft for my liking. I love the IS feature but even that doesn't prevent a few blurry ones from time to time. The IS dosen't do so well with Super Zoom or slow shutter speeds, You should still have a tripod. In sunny conditions it's a great camera but if it's overcast then I'm reaching for another camera. I initially wanted the S5 IS but after reading a lot of reviews about high noise I went with the S3. I was really disappointed when I noticed levels of noise that I didn't expect. I was also expecting the photos to be a little sharper. I have a bad habit of comparing a camera's sharpness to the Fuji FinePix S-series. I have seen some really stunning photos from the S3 and I have taken a few exceptional ones myself. I do recommend it but just think about the type of photos you want to take. I really did want to give this at least 4-5 stars but Low Light ability is a big one in my book.","March 20, 2008",1

The camera has an extremely difficult time determining what to focus on (it can't tell if it should focus on an arm or a face). This issue is in its extreme when you are shooting indoors. 1/2 to 3/4 of my pictures are not focused correctly. The camera is bulky, and if you just want to take your camera with you to take pictures it becomes a burden after a couple of hours. I live in Orlando so I go to Disney a lot, I've pretty much stopped taking my camera because of this reason. The battery life on the camera is excellent and outside pictures are great.

cameras,my review,C. Norton,R3I379PLUT3B14,3,"I like the S3. I am still learning to use the camera. I do agree with others that it is challenging jumping through the manuals. It would have been helpful to me for there to be a complete manual that gives all the details in how to use the camera in a logical sequence. And a quick start pamphlet just to get you going. I had to jump back and forth between the two manuals and that made it difficult for me to learn how to use this camera as I am new to the digital camera with so many features.The view finder can be improved. I have difficulty seeing the messages/symbols. Also, I had to kind of guess that I was right on target for my shots.The photos I have taken came out perfect despite me not being able to know exactly what I was looking at.

The battery life was amazing on this thing. I owned a Samsung before and it ate batteries for dessert. The main problems this camera game me was an occasional Lens Error. That was ok because it didn't do it often and It seems that their motion stabilization wasn't quite up to par on all the shots. On the same settings in the same light roughly 60 percent of the pictures would end up with some sort of blur which was quite disappointing. Luckly I had a large memory card so I solved the issue by taking several photographs. I took this camera to the beach being careful not to get sand in it but after that visit the Lens Errors got really bad and eventually in 2009. The camera refused to start up all together. I probably would not recommend this camera because there is several better and cheaper options on the market these days. For what they want for a new version of this camera you can add 250 dollars and buy a Canon EOS Rebel T1i 15.1 MP CMOS Digital SLR Camera with 3-Inch LCD and EF-S 18-55mm f/3.5-5.6 IS Lens which is a professional grade camera where this is just a high end Amateur camera.,"May 14, 2010",1

The handgrip flexes and the memory card door dosent exactly fit flush.Its also a little more expensive since you have to spring for a charger and a lens hood. (Sony includes both in their H5.)Hopefully Canon can include a bigger LCD and a more solid body in the S4.I'd recommend buying a cheap memory card reader so that you wont have to connect the camera via USB port and save that USB door from use.","July 26, 2006",1

I have had a learning curve, however, in going from 35mm to digital, primarily the lack of image stabilization. My 35mm shots were always in focus, but I would say about 25% of my shots now are soft-focused. I have learned to compensate through the use of prime lenses and manual settings, but I would recommend that anyone new to digital photography take a class or get a companion book for this camera.

My past includes a number of years as a professional doing weddings, portraits, families, etc. I decided recently to invest in a better than average digital and, having owned Nikons since the mid-70's (F2A still works great!), I figured the choice of Nikon was simple. I found the instruction manual a bit overwhelming - especially for a guy who is so comfortable with a camera it's like an extention of my hands. Once you get used to all the features, indicators, etc, it's pretty easy to use. Overall the fit and feel is great, seems like a pretty durable piece of equipment. But there are a couple of issues with the camera. The first is how tiny many of the symbols and lights are - would be much easier on my eyes to have less information but have it bigger! Secondly, the camera consistently over exposes by 2/3 to 1 full stop. I later found that this is a well documented issue discussed in many online forums. Yes, you can dial in exposure compensation, but why should you have to? Especially with a Nikon. Other than that, I'd recommend this as a great camera in it's price range.

cameras,The Nikon d40 With 18-55mm Lens,"Nathan Grammatico ""Nate""",R3V4QY6571DC1G,3,"Here is my Un-Biased review.I have owned the Nikon D40 for around eight months, so i know quite a bit about this camera. There are definitely a few things i like, and a few things i do not like about this camera. I will go over them briefly and discuss a few other things.Here are the Pros ( good things in simpler terms )* You get the versatility of changing lenses to get different effects. you can get telephoto lenses, super-fast lenses, super-wide angle lenses, and so forth. You do not get this maneuverability with a point and shoot camera. This camera being a Digital SLR is an advantage in and of itself.* The cameras delivers very good image quality, better than any point and shoot camera on the market. The images are very sharp, and all of the details are vividly shown, when compared to more expensive Digital SLR cameras, it's obviously not the best of the best, but it is good nonetheless.* The size of the camera is perfect for what it is. It fits nicely in your hand, and feels nice in it. The camera is made of plastic, and does feel a little cheap, but that is expected. People may argue that some of your fingers are left out in the grip, but that is not an issue to me.Here are the cons* With the Nikon D40/D40x/D60 cameras you can not Autofocus AF lenses. AF lenses need Motors built into the camera to Autofocus, and the D40/d40x, and the D60 do not have that motor. They do, however, autofocus AF-S lenses, which have a motor on their own. So, if you love autofocus, and have a few AF lenses, you may want to consider the D80 at least.* The camera only has six megapixels. This isn't a major disadvantage but you definitely notice it when you crop the images, so if you love macro photography, you may want to consider a higher-end camera. To the average day-to-day photographer, this won't be an issue, but for serious Photography, it is definitely a factor.* The performance at higher ISO's is horrible. At ISO 3,200, the images are practically unusable. You even see tremendous noise at ISO 800. If you are considering the D60, it is even worse. For low-light photography this is not a good camera.* No dust-reduction facilities. Yup, you are going to get dust in there eventually, and you are going to have to clean it manually with the D40, which can be dangerous if you are inexperienced, and you may have to pay to have it done, so this is definitely a con in my eyes.If you are looking for an entry-level Digital SLR camera i suggest that you spend a little more on the D60, you are going to get a few more features ( a VR lens, Dust Reduction, etc ) which are very useful. I would even suggest the D90 if you really want your money's worth. This is a good camera, but when compared to others it's not the ' best '. If you are an average person who just wants Amazing pictures and don't worry about ' professional ' things, this camera would be fine.","May 31, 2008",1

Even though it's only 4 mp, the ability to use 10x zoom equiv to 300 mm without changing lenses and a nearly equivalent array of photo settings would have given me a serious case of buyer's remorse if I had actually paid for the D40.The number one shocker was that what I see through the view finder is not what I get. I set the camera to continuous setting, jumped right into manual mode and started shooting away. I shot over 200 photos of everything from hummingbirds, kids playing indoors and outdoors, and landscapes. My mistake was in thinking that everything I shot would look exactly like the crisp imaging the viewfinder showed me.Wrong!At least 80% of the photos ended up in the recycle bin after loading them in my PC. Almost all of them were too dark.Okay - my mistake. I should have been checking the LCD immediately afterwards to make the necessary shuuter and aperture adjustments. On to another batch of shots. I set the camera to Large and Fine photos then headed to the local harbor with the 18-55 lens kit.This time I also brought along my Fuji 5100. My goal was to set up the same shots as much as possible at both widest angles and max zoom. Obviously, my Fuji would be able to zoom in much closer but I figured that with 50% more pixels, I could crop the D40 shots to give me approximate equivalents.The result is that in ideal lighting conditions, on as level a playing field as I could make it, there's virtually no difference in photo quality. The thing that I really couldn't pass up is the constant reminder that if I had just enough space to take one camera on a trip, I'd take the Fuji S5100 every time. It does everything the D40 can do and more without the need to pack along more lenses.The Fuji S5100, as well as many other higher end digcams, do something that I just can't do without. They show me exactly what my photo will look like before I completey depress the shutter. Pressing halfway, I immediately see what I will get whether I use the viewfinder or LCD.To be fair, so will the D40. Except what you need to ""see"" is not the subject, but the viewfinder display line under the subject, in particular, the analog exposure bars which tell you if the output will be too bright or too dark. In layman's terms, its a sliding scale with a ""0"" in the center and bars indicating ""+"" or ""-"". The only thing the subject in view will tell you is whether it's in focus or not.So bottom line is this: the D40 is a very, very good camera. Shots are terrific if you plan on letting the camera do the thinking for you with AUTO mode or some of the other preset modes. You can get used to reading the displays and become quite proficient at these. But for nearly the same price, a very good digital camera with high built in zoom will give you photos just as good without the extra ""cha-ching"" you'll ended up spending on additional lenses.If I didn't have a good digicam already, I'd have probably given this a 4, maybe a 5.","September 9, 2007",1
cameras,Average picture quality - but great screen and very ergonomic and light,H. Beachum,R23ATPPWMILKD3,3,"I'm weary from trying out 4 cameras - Canon A570, SD1000, SD850 and SD870. I actually had decided to go with A570 - but it rejected 2 sets of hi-quality rechargable batteries and screen display was low resolution and hard to see. Screen wasn't much better than my trusty A85 that I own now - just a bigger. Overall, I found the A570, and SD850 to take the best quality pics - I went with SD850 that printed superior pics even tho it's more expensive than SD1000. Pics printed from SD1000 were nearly identical in quality to my A85 that I've had for 3 years. I want an upgrade in picture quality, not the same quality. Don't get me wrong - if you've never had a digital, then you'll like the SD1000 pics and they are very nice. I'm just looking for a little better. The great things about the SD1000 are it's great layout of play/camera button, on/off switch etc. -much better than SD850 - and I also love the size and feel of this camera. I like the ""boxiness"" better than the SD850 or SD970 by far. The LCD screen is outstanding too - but so is screen on SD850. BTW, if you wear polarized sunglasses, SD1000 screen still is viewable - it must not have the anti-glare coating that SD870 has which makes it useless if you wear polarized sunglasses.While picture quality was more important to me this time, SD1000 still prints great pics with minimal effort - I'm a P&S; person using ""auto"" almost all the time. When it really comes down in price, I might actually get one to couple with my SD850 - a nice extra camera for my husband.","November 30, 2007",1
cameras,"Cool Features, but Picture Quality is disappointing.",Stacato,R37GXE3AF75V40,3,"Okay, first the pros. This camera looks super cool, if that's what you're going for. It's tiny and sleek, and the viewfinder is very bright and big, nice package on the outside. Some of the features include the face recognition (cool!), and red-eye reduction. Unfortunately I ended up returning this camera due to the horrible picture quality. I think it is because of the image stabilization or distortion to prevent noise at high iso's, but this camera took pictures that were fuzzier than my 5.0 megapixel Kodak. The images did have vibrant color, but every single one of them was fuzzy and soft, outside or inside, with or without flash. Maybe it's the lense? If you are a stickler for good picture quality and sharp photos, go with something else, even a lower megapixel camera, or wait for an improvement on the SD1000.","June 27, 2007",1
cameras,"Bad battery life, but we may have gotten a dud",kmango,R2QJJ095A76W32,3,"I ordered this after my older Casio Exilim got dropped and broke. The things I like about Canon Powershot in general over the Exilim: MUCH easier to switch between modes (photo, movie, review etc), automatically flips your photos the right way when you review/download them (how do they do that? so cool!).As for this particular camera, it was easy to use but very small. I personally didn't like the boxy look though I read that it is allegedly easier to grip (and I did drop my less-boxy Exilim, after all). I also found the 2.5"" LCD small after the Exilim. The shutter seemed slow indoors in not-particularly-low light, but I'd only had it for a couple days so maybe could have played with the settings if I'd known how.Would have kept the SD1000, but our battery did not seem to be functioning right -- we only got a few hours out of a fully charged battery (and it's not like we were leaving it on), sometimes had trouble turning the camera on when it was just charged, and constantly got messages to recharge soon after charging. I think this was probably a fluke because I haven't seen anything else about it... but that defect combined with my feelings of LCD smallness was enough for me to return it and ""upgrade"" (though you lose the optical viewfinder) to the SD750 (huge 3"" display). It was only about $30 more on Amazon -- We'll see how that one goes.","September 6, 2007",1

While the SD1000 is faster, the picture quality is about the same. The SD 1000 tends to take somewhat noisy pictures indoors. Overall I would say the Finepix E510 takes better or equally good pictures in regard to detail and color, which surprises me. I would have expected the SD 1000 to outperform my old camera.

cameras,The flaws are very annoying...,William D. Barrett (http://www.wdbarrett.com)...,R1DIE7EEZWF8V2,3,"UPDATE: The camera actually takes some very good pictures. The automatic mode uses ""scene settings"" to determine the appropriate mode. The default mode uses an aperture priority and adjusts the shutter speed for exposure. There is an action scene that uses shutter priority and adjusts the aperture for exposure. The landscape mode is smart enough to shut off the fill flash, open the aperture, and adjust the shutter speed for exposure. The trick is picking the right scene. Sometimes, it is easier to put it into manual mode and manually adjust the shutter speed, aperture, and flash.I have decided to keep the camera. The Li-ion battery lasts longer than my older camera that uses rechargeable NiMH AA batteries. I will eventually have to buy a spare battery for convenience. I hope there is a NiMH spare battery available. The reason is that Li-ion batteries only last 1 to 2 years, so it will need to be replaced. The NiMH battery is for backup only, but will last a long time.Hopefully, when I am ready to replace the camera, there will be one that can charge as easily as my cell phone.","February 28, 2009",1
cameras,"Great features, some poor execution",Tilo Christ,R1GQ65IBX033CO,3,"First off, the good: Shoots great, very detailed pictures, excellent videos, I love the high speed burst mode to shoot short series of pictures, the 10x OPTICAL zoom is awesome! The display is large and crisp. Is ready to shoot as soon as you hit the On button.The Big Problem:The lens cover is very flimsy. The camera fell onto the ground from about 1' high and it took me 30 minutes of shaking and manually pushing the parts of the lens cover back and forth until it finally recovered and worked again.On a recent trip to the Southwest (which was admittedly brutal with rocks and sand) the lens cover finally failed for good. Repairs are $160 flat, unless it was impact damage, sand damage, etc., which is the case here. Essentially I can get a new camera for the cost of the repair.I have decided to keep my trusted, super robust Canon Powershot S50 for situations where I feel a more rugged camera would be good and not sure what to do about the Panasonic, yet.Other issues:The packaged software Panorama Maker 4 is unsuitable for newer Intel Macs and Panasonic and the maker of the software both deny any support responsibility. The USB connectivity reports the camera as ""NO NAME"" which looks pretty cheap. Triggering a shot through the USB cable is not possible. I am comparing this to my Canon Powershot S50 which is much more mature in this regard. Basic functionality is available through Mac OS X, and the Canon PhotoStitch software works fine with the Panasonic images.","May 12, 2008",1

cameras,Canon A590: Impressions So Far,Robert Fleischman,R2Q5TAO62NW9KN,3,"I bought this camera so my wife could break into digital photography. She wanted a digital P&S; that had an optical finder. There are not too many of these--Canon is the only one I could think of, and not even all canons have an optical finder. Some just have the LCD screen.I tried a few shots at home before we left on a trip to Europe. It seemed to be working all right, so we took it along. She also brought her trusty Olympus Stylus film camera, ""just in case.""Here's what we found out: first, the camera turned out to be a battery eater. According to the instructions, you should get about 200 shots on a pair of AA alkalines. Well, my wife got more like 30 or 40. One set of batteries was good for about 4 to 6 hours of shooting. She couldn't get a whole day of shooting out of it, even though she turned the camera off when not shooting. Fortunately, I had several sets of spares along. When these ran out, I bought four Kodak AA alkalines in a Paris store. They were gone in a couple of days, so we made a shopping thrip and bought some German batteries. They were maybe a little better--she shot for several hours in the Musee de l'Orangerie.I am thinking the camera may be defective. No chance to follow up on that yet, as we just got back.I had a scare: the pictures viewed on the LCD screen had an out of focus look. I worried that all her pictures might be bad. But the good news is that after downloading to the computer, her shots, viewed on my 17"" monitor, are tack sharp! A fine lens! There were only 2 or 3 unsharp shots out of 579 total, and they are probably ther result of operator error.I can also say I'm very favorably impressed with the Canon's color management. Good, satisfying color that does not disappoint.I don't think the dynamic range from highlight to shadows is very great. The camera, in the hands of an amateur with no time to learn photography, produced quite few blown highlights on scenes that ranged from shadow to bright sky areas, and definitely favors the shadows, which remain readable at the expense of blown highlights. Probably an exposure tweak toward the underexposure side would help things a lot. Of course, almost all digitals are limited in this regard; point-and-shoots perhaps more so than DSLRs.So, summing up:Image quality: Excellent, for such a small camera.Color management: Very good.Exposure latitude: could be better.Ease of use: pretty good!Battery life: A big problem with our sample. We may or may not have a defective sample, and this needs to be followed up on. I'll try to post a followup note when I find out more.","April 22, 2009",1

I could go into all the finer points but there is no reason to do that since I would not buy this camera again nor recommend it to anyone. The fatal flaw; the on off switch is very easy to push unintentionally. When that happens, the lens tries to come out over and over again until the plastic gears are stripped and the camera no longer works. You can overcome this by switching from photo mode to view mode so that the lens doesn't try to come out when the camera is accidentally turned. That seems like too much of an effort for a simple point and shoot. Too bad.

Sometimes the camera fails to focus properly resulting in blurry pictures. I have not figured this one out yet. I take as many shots of a scene as I can and hope there is a good one in the bunch. There is also significant barrel distortion at the wide end of focus. Battery life has been good on mine using Energizer 2500mAh NMH batteries. I like the lighter weight of two batteries instead of four like my A85 uses. I have to crank up the custom color settings to avoid washed out colors. Noise has not been a problem for me so far. Do all cameras in this price range produce pictures which require touching up? This is good and bad news. Pictures usually require a little sharpening and some contrast adjustment and these pictures respond well to the adjustments. However, 90% of the pictures require this fiddling.

Additionally, the A590 came with a standard memory card of 32MB which equates to approx. 17 images. I'm not sure why the camera is sold with so little memory. Overall, I am satisfied with the camera for the price, but would probably save a little longer for a better one in hindsight.","September 23, 2008",1

Yes, it does at 1600x1200 resolution mode only but then why buy a 8M pixel camera to shoot in 2M mode?!? Geez...Also, the canon software will not upload to a network drive (like my NAS so I have to manually transfer them after it uploads to the local disk).Other than those 2 easy but critical features, it's a good camera. Well built. I bought a nikon 8M and it was flimsy (but it did the above 2 features fine). The nikon broke in 6 months so I bought this canon on it's good reviews.

cameras,Decent,"J. Speights ""cd fiend""",R3IXS8MAR5O3W6,3,"The image stabilization and the face detection work well, and most images come out wonderfully. There is a noticeable issue with noise and fast moving subjects are still an issue for me. One is common in ultra compacts and one may simply require another round with the manual so take that for what it's worth.I found the menu and settings to be usable, but the settings I want are sometimes buried on a third level. Sometimes menu response has lagged a bit, which can be frustrating when your subject is moving faster than you are.I moved from a Canon SD20 so having an optical zoom is wonderful. Plus, this camera is not that much larger than the SD20 so I still feel like I will take it out with me without worrying about bulk.Battery life seems fine so far...much better than the SD which only holds a few minutes charge these days, despite having replaced the battery.The SD1100 seems to do a decent job overall and overcomes the photographic failures of it's operator (what do I know). If you want a simple point and shoot, you could do much worse. If you want more manual control over your pics, really good low light performance or something to document your next roller derby match, this may not be ideal.","April 27, 2008",1
cameras,"Good Results for Its Size, BUT...",Confederate,RO4NSCYOTVD6B,3,"This camera is unremarkable in its output, but is rich in features. It makes a good traveling camera, but if you decide on it, I'd set the image compensation to +1. Set at zero, the images tend to lack contrast and rich saturation. This is true with most cameras, both digital and print. The extra boost in exposure fills in shadow detail and boosts color saturation. Owners also should invest in a copy of Adobe Photoshop Elements, if they don't have it already.If you can cart around a slightly bigger camera, it should pay off with better quality photos; but if you want to travel light, this is as good a way as any.","September 6, 2008",1

cameras,Long shot-to-shot time; fill flash feature hard to find,Silicon Valley Girl,R2G4QI8GLW5UWM,3,"This is a solid little camera that can provide excellent image quality under the right conditions. But it has two glaring deficiencies:1. No fill flash option in auto mode. (There is a fill flash option in manual mode, but it's not easy for the casual user to find.) There's red-eye reduction, of course, and you can turn the flash off completely or let the camera decide when to fire it. But with the camera in auto mode, you can't tell it to fire the flash on every shot, regardless of what its sensor thinks. Major bummer when you want to photograph a backlit subject.2. Shot-to-shot time is agonizingly slow, and focus time isn't especially speedy, either. This is a problem when, for example, you want to catch quick snaps of the animals you see on Disney World's Kilimanjaro Safaris. Ask me how I know.I'm sure this is a fine camera for people who want to photograph landscapes, still lifes, and posed portraits.

cameras,Great Macros...Poor medium to long range Autofocus,Just another reviewer,R3ETZKGIL793E1,3,"I picked up this camera two weeks ago at a local store. Overall, it's a solid camera. Color reproduction is wonderful, it's quick, low noise with high iso, and terrific macros. The camera is blazing fast. Please refer to the other posters for the good points of this camera.Now i'll discuss the shortcomings. The major one, which has been referenced to in various forums such as dpreview and a few online review sites is poor AutoFocus. Not all cameras are affected, but mine was. If you shoot at an object from w/in 10 ft, it has trouble over 50% of the time picking up the autofocus point and often selects the wrong point. If you use center focus, it gets pretty close but final image is still a bit blurry. It becomes a bit sharper w/ the live view autofocus system. When I took some outdoor pics of some animals, i couldn't quite lock on what i was interested in. Even when taking shots of people outside w/ a prominent background, it seems to have trouble deciding if it wants to focus on the person or the background. I'd say that 20% of my shots were actually in focus and those look wonderful. The remaining ones had the focus off. So i'm gonna send my camera to canon for repair. I went to best buy and tried out a 40D and the focus was rock solid. If you get a good camera, kodus to u.","July 6, 2008",1

cameras,"Great camera, *BUT* my images are not very sharp","Elliott S. Mccrory ""profelliott""",R20OADCM6ICFE8,3,"This review is hard for me to write. This camera is a great camera, and everyone who has credentials says that it takes great pictures--almost as good as more expensive cameras. This may be true for some, but it has proven to be problematic for me.My gripe is with the sharpness of the images I get.When I take a picture with this camera in anything but perfect conditions (e.g., outside on a sunny day with the sun at my back), I see blur in the image long before I see pixels. My wife has an ancient Canon SD200 (3.2 MPixel) camera, and in all situations (except ""perfect""), in an A-B comparison of the two images (one from her camera and one from the XSi), the SD200 images are usually sharper. I can zoom in on the pixels in the two images, and at the zoom level at which I see pixels in the SD200 image, I see blur in the XSi image.I know, I know, ""apples and oranges"". The SD200 lens is an f8 (or something) 8mm and this one is an f3.5 18mm. But what do I know? I know which image is sharper, and it is the SD200.The really frustrating thing for me is that the images on the SD200 in low light are better, too. Of course, the image stabilization of the 18-55 lens helps a bit, and the XSi will ""win"" sometimes because of this (the SD200 does not have IS). But, again, the A-B comparison is revealing: the SD200 wins most of the time.Forget about low-light close-ups with this camera. Use a small-sensor camera for that! You can get a LOT closer with those tiny, stopped-down lenses!They say, on the Internets, that there is a possibility of the focusing hardware being slightly off and in need of ""calibration""--that would explain my troubles. But I have tried f22 tests, tripod tests, and manual focus (intentionally putting the image slightly out of focus in each direction). I have also tried RAW capture and playing with the sharpness in the Canon-supplied software.I just cannot get truly sharp images with this camera.I suspect that there may be something wrong with the specific instance of the Canon XSi that I own. Maybe my camera was manufactured on a Friday afternoon before a 3-day weekend, and that my wife's SD200 is one of those incredible convergences of a happy day with happy workers making a perfect instance of a good camera.I just purchased a Canon 7D to replace this camera. I'll let you know how this 18.1 MPixel ""Image Monster"" compares to the SD200. :-) And look for my XSi on EBay soon.","September 23, 2010",1
cameras,"Good camera, okay lens",Roger T. Wright,R2Y379QCH0C4GM,3,"Great menu system, easy to use controls with a wonderful 3"" display. The supplied lens is the downfall for me, the image quality is okay but the ""feel"" is distressing. I know the lens is a trade off, offering a lot for the price but putting an ""L"" lens on the XSi is a real eye opener, brings the camera to life. Were I to do it over I would easily still buy the Rebel XSi body but would purchase a good prime lens (fast Canon 35 or 50mm) and give up the benefits of the zoom. Soon after purchasing the Rebel XSi kit I added a Canon 135 f2 L and was rewarded with some stunning photos with great ""pop"". While putting a high quality (and high priced) lens changes the XSi from a good camera to a great camera the reviewed lens/body combination is a great move up for most of us and priced well. Battery life is amazingly good and the RAW image files are supported by many software packages. The body with a simpler, high quality lens would receive a 5 star rating from this consumer.","October 28, 2008",1

I sensed the product was previously opened and repacked when I first received it. Nobody wants their new camera to have been used or even shipped to someone else. While Amazaon did say I could return the camera and receive another one, it was before Christmas and I didn't have a guarentee that I would receive it in time or even receive another one that was previously opened or even used as well. I have since found other items in the Nikon D90 box that confirmed my product was previously opened and used by someone else. Quite disappointing considering Amazon listed the product as new.The camera itself.....fantastic. I have waited some time for a digital SLR and have dealt with the slow instant digital cameras in the meantime. I had a Nikon 2020 previously and was awaiting the right product to purchase. I felt that the Nikon D90 was it and it hasn't disappointed. While perhaps the build quality isn't the same as my old 2020, it is still pretty solid.

The d90 performs well; so far I have no complaints, except the plastic body feels a little ""chintzy"" after my sturdy metal Nikons of the past. The images are acceptable, although this is my first time using a zoom lens, and I may be prejudiced in favor of the sharpness of prime lenses. When using the ""P"" mode, I found turning the aperture wheel a bit awkward. The d90 is a great option for photographers who are in between amateur and pro, and will make a good ""extra"" camera for professionals. I'm looking forward to getting a full frame dslr when the cost is right. Lens choices are complex due to the smaller frame of the d90: buy cheaper DX lenses, or pay the tariff on better lenses that will fit a future camera, too? If you're vacillating, don't fear the d90, just know it's not quite pro quality, but good bang for the buck spent.","May 7, 2009",1
cameras,I love my camera- updated,"shopping fiend ""sappy""",RX3ZVERJ4VFED,3,"This is the first time I have used anything but a point and shoot. I have been wanting a DSLR since I visited a friend with a Canon Xti and took some great pics of my child. I thought getting any DSLR would ""work"" and bought a Sony A230. I was so not satisfied and read that maybe the lens would help. Still not happy with the pics so I took it back and after extensive review bought the D90. The pics I am taking with this thing are outstanding. I bought the $100 potrait lens, the exposure books and some Nikon D90 guides. I still am deciding between a telefoto lens, between the 55-200mm or the 70-300mm. I also did a 30 day trial with lightroom and decided to buy it. Since buying this camera a month ago and learning all I could to do portraits, I have actually been asked for the copyright of the pics I took of my daughter and her baby brother because the photo guy thought a professional had done the pics. I also have been asked to take a pic for my friends article in a sports magazine. I knew nothing about photography before this. I've never adored a piece of equipment before where I thought if I could only save one thing in a fire it would be obvious what I would save until I got this camera.

The problem wasn't the lens, since I compared both cameras using a new 16-85 Nikon lens, which by-the-way, is a really nice lens.

cameras,Too Bad the Video is not up to par = Don't buy for the Video,J. Marshall,R22FQDRTQ6FQ9C,3,"As a very happy Nikon D80 user, I mostly bought the D90 for the Video feature. Unfortunately the Video just does NOT work well. Unless you are rock steady while hand holding the camera, you will get jumpy and distorted videos. Even while using a very good tripod you will get mixed results. Also the Video focus does not always stay locked on, so you can start in focus, and then lose it. Plus, if you are shooting Video in brite sun, it's often hard to tell if the focus has gotten locked because it's difficult to see the Video Focus lock indicator on the screen. On the plus side, I really like the new INFO button that puts the data on the top screen of the camera on to the rear screen at twice size. It's great if you need glasses to read the top screen. Also the rear screen is larger than the D80, which is very nice.The Camera has a mini HDMI output, but mine didn't come with a cable and they are tough to find right now. So you might want to buy one when you buy the camera.Other than the poor Video, I think this is a very good camera.","October 10, 2008",1

cameras,Awesome 21x zoom camera and HD camcorder that fits in my pocket!,Happy r/c,R2TMZIL0QWCMLY,3,"PROS:I'm usually the camera and camcorder guy and my wife never takes out our old camera and camcorder before but with this new Panasonic camera, she takes it everywhere to shoot closeups of my kid's soccer games and snaps pictures from afar with action shots with kids that are airborn and limbs/ball flying in midair. Although the camera is rated at 12x zoom at 10 megapixels, if you lower the megapixels down to 5 then you'd get 17x zoom. If you lower the megapixels down to 3 then you'd get 21x zoom.The HD camcorder has unbelievable clarity and the microphone is clear. Be sure to buy SDHC memory card (not SD) with speed rated at Class 6 or higher or it won't keep up with recording video. Also, your pc's SD card reader slot will NOT read SDHC memory card so remember to buy an external SDHC card reader.The included HD camcorder software figures out what your pc's cpu is and adjusts the framerate. Turns out my 6 year old HP Pentium 4 2.5ghz pc is too slow so I went out and bought the new HP p6120f (AMD Quad 4 processor at 2.6Ghz, 6gigs RAM, 640gigs hard drive) from Staples for $[...] and the HD animation is smoooth. The software suggests a pc with at least a processor of 2 Core Duo 2.6Ghz to edit HD video.The real test to determine if I were going to keep the camera came when I developed a photo onto paper to assess the picture quality. The picture was sharp so I decided to keep it and bought a spare Panasonic battery from Amazon for $[...].This Panasonic's twin is the German-made Leica D-lux4 camera that sells for $[...] (that's $400 more than the Panasonic twin) which has a classic look and saves raw format with more manual adjustment features. So, you're getting a very high-end camera. See Leica:[...]Back in 2001, I bought a 3.3 megapixels Panasonic DMC-LC33 camera and it still works great today after 8 years (considering how many times I dropped it and my kid has fallen on it with while the lens were still out but the lens retracted just fine) so I know that it's a quality dependable product, and that was with a plastic body.- There's a setting that lets me take videos of saltwater aquariums (which are usually lit with a blue bulb) and gets rid of the blue so that the footage is not bluish.CONS:- Only included an RCA cable to connect to my tv. Too bad it didn't include an HDMI cable (mini to standard) so I ordered one from [...] for $[...] (ROSE RCW-H9039 6"" HDMI-MINI CABLE - Retail)- The included PhotoStudioFunHD software manual says that you should use this software to copy your AVCHD LITE format files to the pc and NOT use Windows Explorer to copy your files over or it will not be able to read it. I found out the hard way... however, all is not lost, you can download free trial of Sony Vega or other softwares at [...] then edit all your files and it doesn't matter how you copied the files to your pc. When I opened Task Manager to see how much work my processors were doing, I noticed that the included PhotoStudioHD software was only using 1 processor whereas the Sony Vega software took full advantage of all 4 processors.- Doesn't take low light indoor rooms as well as SONY.- 12/1/2012 UPDATE: Lasted a little over a year when dust somehow got into the lens so now a black spot shows up on the screen and the footage.","November 13, 2009",1

When my camera broke, I was never able to speak to a real person. Panasonic's automated phone line and web help both directed me to send the camera and all its accessories to their center in Texas. I shelled out $15 to send the camera back. I then received a letter telling me my warranty was rejected but that I could get a reconditioned camera that was about $50 below what I could I get the camera for on amazon.

Unfortunately, I dropped it when taking it out of my pants pocket. It fell less than three feet to the ground, where the glass on the back broke. I can see only the tiniest nick in the glass, but about a quarter of the screen is black and the rest is nearly worthless- I can see about a third of the lines that used to show what I was seeing. If I'd dropped it from a greater height or onto a rock or something I could see it being damaged, but it was a short fall and now the camera is worthless, as there's no other viewfinder.

cameras,HD is great; photos not so much,Boston Tom,R3QQ91HW9VW1I6,3,"Full disclosure: I bought this unit and returned it.I bought this camera primarily for the HD video capabilities. In this regard, it's spectacular. No disappointments there. I had a first generation Flip Video unit, so the ZS3 was a huge leap forward.Coupled with the excellent stereo microphones (mounted on top so be mindful not to cover the mics), the video quality is top-notch, provided there's decent light. Battery life seemed to be very good. Anyone familiar with today's point and shoot cameras won't have a problem using this camera after playing with it for a day or two. If you search for the words ""chapman"" ""school"" ""christmas"" at vimeo DOT com, you'll find a HD video I shot.(I was about 50-75 feet away from the stage. People with slower machines/connections might get a lot of stutter unless they turn off the ""HD"" setting.) But despite the video quality, I was less than pleased with the photo capabilities. I tried a many of the quality settings, but unless you use the flash or have plenty of available light, photos at ISO 400 and up have too much noise for my taste. I have a DSLR (Canon Digital Rebel 300D) so I'm used to better photo quality. While photo taking was a small reason why I got the camera, it nagged at me that the quality wasn't better, so I decided to return the unit. When the price drops over the next year, I may get a used one at a lower price because the HD quality is that good.","January 7, 2010",1
cameras,No EVF a big problem,PierrefromBayRidge,R34C34IXT3M0UN,3,"It's probably unfair to write a review after only one day's ownership, especially a work day, but here are a few thoughts.12x zoom in a pocket camera is an amazing thing. Whatever other camera(s) you own, this is the one you can take everywhere.And while the 65x zoom available with combined optical/digital doesn't produce pictures that you'd want to show anywhere, it's certainly fun for spying on people. I was even able to see people at the top of the Empire State building taken from the street, 10 blocks away.Polarized sunglasses can make the screen disappear in bright sunshine. (Do wish this camera had a viewfinder.)27 scene modes cover most conditions, but they're on 2 separate screens, and the first has modes such as ""baby"" and ""pet"" (which I don't need) while ""burst"" and ""flash burst"" are on the second screen Wish one could move them around.Tried flash burst in a pretty dark room and didn't work very well, pictures were much darker than with normal flash, though the camera's flash refreshes fairly quickly so you can take a series of pictures with full flash almost as fast as in burst mode. Didn't try burst flash in a room with some lights on, yet. One of my reasons for wanting this camera is to be able to take candid pictures in a party situation and my old Sony H-5 just takes too long and I'd miss more pictures than I'd get.I'll add to this review after I use the camera a bit more.UPDATE: I've had the camera for about a month now and just returned from a weekend in Wash DC. The weather was gorgeous, not a cloud in the sky, and that was the problem. Without a viewfinder, I ended up taking lots of shots just guessing because I couldn't see the screen because of the glare. You want to take pictures with the sun behind you, lighting up the subject of your shot, but that means the sun is shining onto the screen, thus making it almost useless. It actually turns into a mirror. If you focus, you can barely see through the picture of your own face and see a dim outline of what you're shooting and hope for the best. This is not really acceptable. Otherwise the camera is great. The wide angle allows you to get shots that would be impossible (the whole dome of the capitol from underneath it) and the 12 x zoom is great and the HD movies are great, but taking pix in sunlight is what everyone needs to do. I did not try making the screen brighter, and I will play around with this next time I'm in sun and not with family, but the glare off the screen was so bad that I can't see that making a difference. I have a protective shield on the screen. Maybe they make one that acts as ""sunglasses."" I'll have to check. I don't know why Panasonic chose not to put an EVF but this was a major blunder and while there aren't a lot of point and shoots with 12 x zooms to choose from out there, you might want to wait for one that has an EVF.","October 14, 2009",1

cameras,Water leaked in on first snorkeling trip!,Amazon Customer,R2WATZRSX77B3B,3,"This is a great camera actually. I took a series of 100+ shots outside water, and was very happy with the results and file quality (I normally use a high-end Canon DSLR semi-professionally). In fact, I rented this camera from a camera rental outfit to test it before buying one.Unfortunately, during my first snorkeling outing in Hawaii and on only the second day of my vacation, the camera leaked in water. I was dismayed because I had checked and rechecked all the ports for the presence of dust. I even made sure to press the ports down firmly to get a tight seal. Everything seemed perfect, but it wasn't so. I only noticed the leak inside the camera after it stopped working while snorkeling. I came out of the water right away, but there was already water inside the camera, as seen by water pearls on the back of the LCD, and in front of the lens. Ironically, a couple next to me in the water had the same camera and theirs was working perfectly.Of course, even drying the camera for a week didn't revive it. The guys at LensRentals were super nice when I called them right away, and refunded the rental price. Unfortunately, I could not take any underwater images during the whole vacation as a result.The idea behind this type of camera is great, but I believe that it's implementation, whether Canon, Olympus, etc, is fraught with potential for disastrous leaks. I've used underwater casings before, and they are usually very reliable. The way it is implemented here is not!","September 9, 2009",1
cameras,Great little camera ready for a rough life.,"Sheepsaymoo ""Silence is golden. Duct tape is ...",RWEYLM7OJRA99,3,"I am a notorious camera killer. I have worked as a professional photographer and can take care of those cameras, however I have a tendency to be rough on my point and shoots. I've gone through 3 Sony point and shoots in the last 2 years, so when looking for a new camera, I wanted a DURABLE one.After doing a lot of research and reading a lot of reviews, this camera stood out as the top durable, waterproof, all around camera. And I am quite happy with it so far after 4 months.This camera ha withstood 10+ foot drops from my roof, getting stepped on, dropped, beer spilt on it, left out in a rainstorm over night, fell out of my car while rushing around dropping people off, videotapping sledding, got lost in a snow drift, and lot of little sticky kid hands and has taken everything like a CHAMP. It has never once froze, halted, stopped, or died!Now onto the taking picture parts. My sister has a Canon Powershot that I have been superimpressed with, in terms of photo quality, speed, and use of flash in low light settings and I thought I would be getting that performance with this one, which is what really sold me on the camera. However, I was a little disappointed. It does take fantastic pictures in perfect light, however in low light situations the flash is SLOW and pictures do not always come out in focus. Underwater, you have the same problem in low light settings. It's battery life is also incredibly poor, I have to charge it after 300 pictures.The features on the camera are rather nice, however. It's easy to use and navigate, and you have lots of fun options to play with. It's automatic settings work quite nicely, and change according to your lighting situation seamlessly. The hatches are hard to open, but should be. It took me a bit to finesse finagling with the ball at the end of the strap to get the hatches open. They seal very well, you know when the click in. I've had it underwater numerous times Extreme Todepooling (snorkeling in tidepools) up to 5 ft and it works quite happily. I wash it off with fresh water at the bathrooms after and have never had any problems with it malfunctioning.In terms of portability and size, this thing is a BEAST, but that's why I love it. It's meant to take whatever you give it, it's build to be tough not pretty. It's got more weight then your usual point and shoot but can fit in a small/medium purse without a problem (it doesn't take up too much room in my square Harvey's purse) I've beaten mine up and so far the body has no visible scratches on it. The lens is easy to clean with a soft t-shirt or lens cleaning cloth.It was expensive, but I am glad that I paid for a camera that will make it longer then 6 months!","November 19, 2010",1
cameras,Nice Camera. Smaller than I expected (and that's cool),"JR Fent ""4 8 15 16 23 42""",R2WYPS6OOOFSTF,3,"This is my first camera that I've ever had that does not have a view finder. I'm a little perplexed by that and looking at an LCD to take pictures is not comfortable for me yet. HOWEVER - the results were excellent. I took a couple friends sailing the other day and they had forgotten to charge the batteries on their water-proof digital. So I let them use mine for the day. They said the differences were shocking. To them, the Canon was easier to figure out, faster loading, and had a faster 'shutter speed' (I know that in digital, it's not really a shutter). They were also impressed by the 30' water depth capability of the Canon. Their camera a major brand sold at Costco) was nearly the same price as the Canon, and was only rated to 3 meters (about 9')The picture quality was IMPRESSIVE. The one thing I was a little surprised at was the drain down on the battery. We took about 90 pictures that day and the battery was wiped out. We only had a handful of pics that used the flash - so I was surprised the battery did not last longer. I'm adjusting some of the settings such as how long the LCD stays on and seeing if I can get better battery results next time. If All else fails, I'll buy an extra couple battery packs.So I would have rated this 5 stars, except for the lack of an 'old school' view finder, and the limited battery life. BTW - if it had the 'old school' view finder, I'm sure the battery would have lasted way longer.UPDATE: On second trip to Hawaii we had a leak in this camera. I noticed the water when the interior of the lens fogged. We were able to keep using it - but I'll never submerge it again.","October 20, 2010",1
cameras,Nice Camera but a few things to be aware of,K. Wolter,R17049IXJQ037M,3,"I bought this from Amazon for my wife who does a lot a canoeing. It's a sweet camera that takes nice pictures. However, there are a few things we are not happy with and users should be aware of. FIrst, the bar of soap / submarine shape is not very good for something you want to hold on to. It slid out of my wife's hands one time when she went to pick it up and hit the floor. One of the strap mounts popped out and it got a little ding on the corner of the LCD display. Fortunately it continued to work, remains watertight and I glued the strap button back in with some G-Flex epoxy. Second is an occasional ""lens error"" message that pops up. We have had three Canon cameras in this price range over the years and two out of three suffered from this problem. I figured some dirt had gotten into the mechanism that moves the optics for zooming but this is not possible for the D10. All of the mechanism is totally sealed and all motion takes place inside the camera. Dirt and water can't get in. I'm surprised that after having the ""lens error"" problem for about a decade that Canon hasn't resolved it. Search the web for ""canon lens error"". Third, be very careful using this camera where there are jets of water i.e. around a running hose, the water park, etc. The streams of water can have enough force to get past the seals in the camera. I suspect that tossing the camera into the water or moving it swiftly through the water can also breach seals in the camera. I noticed a few spots of condensation inside the LCD screen cover while taking pictures at the water park. Though the camera still worked fine, I immediately removed the battery, and set it in the sun for about an hour with battery and connector doors open. The condensation cleared and all is well.So, nice camera but needs some help in the ergonomics department and Canon needs to dispense with the ""lens error"" problem some of these cameras have once and for all!!!Two years after the above review and the camera still works well with no more lens errors. I think moisture inside the camera was causing the lens error. However, we avoid using it in the water now since it's no longer waterproof. I also made a little wooden grip out of a 7/8"" diameter dowel that is glued to the right side of the camera (Looking from the back) using West Systems G-Flex epoxy so that we can get a better grip. Works great and my wife loves the ""upgrade"". When I wanted a waterproof camera I wound up getting a Canon ELPH 300 HS and a waterproof case for it. I prefer this combination since it's cheaper and I have the best of both worlds, compact camera and waterproof camera.","August 10, 2010",1

cameras,3.5 - 4 stars,Gadgets & Gizmos,R7HKGTHGGW5JZ,3,"I pretty much got this camera as a 3rd camera for water trips since I was too cheap to buy an underwater housing for my s90 and 5dmkII. Picture quality wise it's never going to be as clear as the s90 and obviously no where near the 5d. I expected this. For a point a shoot, the camera does its job, although it really struggles in low light. Maybe I'm spoiled by my other camera's but I expected more especially for $300.Size wise this thing is a honker. Sized funnily so it doesn't fit well in your pocket and is heavy to boot. Had it not been for the fact that I have several batteries for my s90 which this camera can also use I would've probably gone to the underwater Panasonic TS-3.Overall durability of the camera is good. I think it's more geared for families with kids who go to the water park or to the beaches. toss the camera to your kids for some quick pictures, if they drop it in the water or the sand no worries.","March 4, 2011",1

I consider Canon a great company with quality products so I decided I should just bite the bullet and get the Canon D10 instead.I used it underwater about 5 times shooting photos and video. They all turned out wonderfully and are great quality. It was easy to switch back and forth from picture to video, from underwater to beach mode.However, yesterday I took it to my favorite snorkeling spot and used it for about an hour. Afterward, in the car I wiped the lens down (I didn't want water droplets on my photos for the rest of the day). Then I tried to turn it on and I got this message ""Lens error. Restart camera."" Every time I start the camera I get this message and can't go any further. There may be water under the lens (it looked like a little seeped through but it was hard to tell).In other words, the camera is broken. It worked at the beach for awhile, but I've only owned it for one month. Should last a lot longer than that for the price and because it is Canon.

I checked all the little doors to make sure they were securely closed before I got into the water. When I tried to use it in the water it wouldn't turn on. Thinking the battery was dead I took it back to the boat. That's when I noticed that there was water inside the screen. When I opened the compartments for the battery and the USB plug I noticed that they were damp. Clearly the camera leaked while in less than four feet of water.I was unhappy with the initial response I received from Canon. However, when I sent an email letting them know that I was unhappy with the response, a supervisor contacted me and sent me a UPS shipping label to send the camera in at no cost to me. She told me that I should email her a copy of the repair estimate once I received it. The estimate said that it would cost $179 to repair the camera. When I contacted the supervisor she said that they would send me a refurbished camera (which could actually be a new camera that was excess inventory) free of charge. I received the new camera today.

It has been a great addition to our collection of other Canon cameras. I've always been a Canon 'junkie'. We have purchased this camera for the third time. I will take the blame for the first replacement as the seal wasn't all the way in. But on the other two - the seals were all the way in and the camera filled with water. The second replacement of (3rd camera) we used for the first time in my parents pool in NJ and it filled with water the first time. We sent it back to Canon who determined the seals failed and they sent us another (which actually makes our 4th camera). After having that one for a few months - the seals have failed again. While we were waiting for the replacement of that one, we purchased the Olympus digital water camera - and I HATE IT. The quality of the pictures is pathetic, which just makes me even more sad that our Canon has failed us again. It really is a great little camera with fantastic versatility but I can't see myself purchasing another one to see it die after a few months.

Everyone felt like they were in the raft with us. Shooting video in the ocean while doing boogie boarding was great too.I paid a lot more than the current price and think it was worth it.ConsI wish it fit in my pocket like the Nikon AW100.The neck strap configuration, which looks like a great convenience, is an extra and is priced excessively. Highway robbery by Canon if you ask me.Towards the end--my wife lost the camera this summer--the zoom wasn't working while recording video. That wasn't good.I've basically sworn off of Canon point and shoots because of recurring dead pixel problems on the LCD--""scratch"" lines give way to a dime-size gray circle, which are annoying although picture quality is not affected. Canon apparently has a systemic problem and won't address it for customers. I did not have that issue with the D10, but Canon's LCD failures have scarred me. I'm leaning towards the Panasonic or Nikon cameras.","November 3, 2011",1

This camera although good does not even come close to the 850. The biggest problems are red eye and blurriness. I rarely had either problem with the 850. The flash is in a tiny sliver at the top front of the camera and the instrutions warn that if you accidentally put your finger on it it could destroy the flash. It makes holding the camera akward. I was so happy with the 850 and this is most certainly a downgrade.

Connections to the camera's via Dlink is slow and delayed. I had and still am having trouble setting up the (2) cameras I purchased by just using a 3rd party app on my droid and by setting up port forwarding optioning in the router. It was so much simplier with my Cisco camera.My only other gripe is that the email notification optioning is limited. Either Motion Detection is ON ALL the time or you can set time frames to send you notfications but on a given interval basis only all the time. (ie: every 60 sec, every 300 seconds, etc.). With my other camera, I can set for Motion Detection during given time frames which this DLINK doesn't offer.

The motion detection is sensitive to sunlight so as the sun moves around your house sometimes you will get false positives based on the amount of sunlight in the detection area.

We have a very old laptop that we have converted into a permanent baby-monitor, so any time we wake up during the night, we can glance over at it and see how the baby is doing.If you're technically inclined, setup is rather simple, though I have to admit, I did not follow the included instructions. It must be set up using ethernet, even if you intend to use it wirelessly - so plan to set it up near your router.There are a number of down-sides. The audio is really quite terrible. It is filled with static and frequent pops. It picks up noises well, but it is really obnoxious if you're going to leave it running all the time. The other downside is that the software it comes with is awful. It is extremely limited. The IOS app is fine, though it does not include many of the features of the PC software. The Android app is awful - it is delayed by perhaps 30 seconds. When you connect to Android or via the dlink online website, it will time out after a certain period of time, and will need to be reconnected.In order to use it with our old laptop as a full-time baby monitor, I wrote a custom HTML file for it, based on the dlink network page.

I unfortunately did not notice this until after I had downloaded the pictures the first day... a simple fix though, I just made sure that I wiped the lense off before I used it and it did fine the 2nd day.The camera also does not take very good ""macro"" pictures as it does not have this function so trying to take close shots of flowers or such yields fuzzy pictures. The only other downside is that in bright sunlight it is hard to see the viewfinder to take a picture... not a huge deal as you can use the eyepiece, but was kind of a downside.Overall for 2 days on a river and almost 200 pictures later, the camera fit my purpose and I ended up with shots that I might not have otherwise gotten had I not had a waterproof camera.","July 22, 2011",1

cameras,"Works well, just might wipe all your photos accidently.",Abe The Babe,R21QGTO7W2NYAX,3,"I bought this to take with me on my honeymoon in Cancun. I took it everywhere for 10 nights. I took it snorkeling, I took it to the beach, I took it to the Grand cenote, I even took it zip lining into the water at XPLOR. Pictures are not amazing quality but they are more than enough for memories and it was great knowing I didn't have to worry about it getting wet and being underwater.Even though the processor is slow and it take a couple of seconds to start the camera, load pictures, etc. I would have given it 5 stars because it's such a great value for the price. However, we're sitting at the swim up bar on the last day of our honeymoon looking at the pictures and my wife asks me to delete one of them. So I press delete, it asks me if I want to delete just this picture or all of them. Obviously, I select the option that deletes this picture only and press enter. Then it says, are you sure you want to delete all your pictures? Now at this point I'm having a mild heart attack and I make sure to select NO and I hit enter. AND IT STARTS DELETING ALL THE PICTURES. I felt incredibly bad for about 2 hours because I thought I had lost over 300 pictures of my honeymoon. Now I'm tech savvy enough to know not to take any more pictures or all hope will be lost. I cross the street to radio shack and buy a card reader and download file recovery software and I was able to get 99% of my pictures back. Disaster averted, but an unnecessary experience.In conclusion, buy the camera, it works. Just DON'T try to do anything on the actual camera except take pictures and change settings. When you transfer all the images to your computer, then you can decide which ones to keep.","July 30, 2013",1

cameras,Good with limitations,John Russell,R1C1S2LH92EXMR,3,"For the price this camera works quite well but can also work very poorly if not used correctly.My wife used this camera on 2 snorkeling outings in Belize. I didn't look at the camera or read the manual before the trip because I didn't think it would be worth the trouble. After seeing the pictures from our first day I was impressed. Decided that I could improve on the pics. Found that the mode she used was auto and not H2O and showed her how to use the zoom.The second outing produce awful pictures. They were green. So very green. Many pictures were not clear anymore now either.Back home now and looked at camera specs. No optical zoom. All zoom is digital. So don't use zoom. If you want to zoom do so on your computer using crop and leave camera unzoomed.So if you,1)use auto2)don't zoomIf you do this you will get some very nice underwater pictures.Camera did not leak.Set of batteries lasted each day out.","January 18, 2013",1

cameras,"Good, but not great",Robert Evans,R38OSODJ0E7CLT,3,"I bought this camera to take with me for some underwater video for my upcoming Great Barrier Reef trip in Australia, however when it arrived, I knew right away that this was more of a toy than something I wanted to capture memories with. The camera is actually good, with adequate lighting and the video's are great too, but I wanted better images and real HD video.Cons: - Takes forever to turn off - Extremely slow SD card transfer of images (using a class 4 card) - Slow if you want to take images quickly - LCD makes pictures look great, but then you look on larger screen and they are blurry - Not real HD 720/1080 video, just SD - Only 10ft underwaterPros: - Uses easy to source AA batteries - The cheap priceAll in all, I will spend a little more money to buy a Fuji XP50 or 60 so I can get better quality imagery and great underwater video. You can find a refurbished Xp50 for about $100 dollars as of 04/2013 and it can go up to 33ft underwater.This Kodak is a great all around camera, but so is my Samsung Note 2 - and much better. I bought a Frieq universal underwater case (upto 100ft underwater) for my phone if I want to use that too (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00AW2QT8I/ref=oh_details_o00_s00_i01?ie=UTF8&psc;=1)UPDATE: After countless days of being indecisive - I didn't get the Fuji XP50. I was then looking at the XP100, but it seemed to not be adequately reviewed and I wasn't 100% sure of wanting that over the XP50/60. The XP60 was a little over $200 dollars and I just really didn't want to spend that much - especially since I'm buying this specifically for my trip, so I then keep going back to the XP50. After more searching I then came across the Nikon Coolpix AW100, it hands down was the BEST choice for the money, comes with GPS, 16MP CMOS Sensor, 33ft depth for underwater and 5X optical zoom. The pictures I came across online look great underwater and out of the water and it can do 60FPS HD 1080 video! If you search the webs you can find it for about $160-ish bucks refurbished and I'm REALLY happy with it - so much more camera for about 65 bucks more.","March 30, 2013",1
cameras,"Canon C123 - Very good, but ...",GeBat,RT5LTL8PHFFVB,3,"I bought this camera for my boyfriend as a Christmas present, and since my sister lives in Chicago and we live in Argentina, I got her to bring me the camera. Very good price, good quality picture, and it looked as a reliable product. I have some concerns about some of the negative reviews, saying that there were leakings and odd behaviour after using it underwater. I decided, though, to give it a try, risking that if the camera failed I wouldn't be able to get a refund, because sending the camera over would be a pain in the ass and it could take forever. Plus, I really wanted this to be the present. So, this was the scenaro in which the camera was bought, to give you an idea of why the rating. Here's what happened. We used the camera for regular shooting, outside, inside. I'm a photographer so I tried pretty much everything. We used it out of the water like a week or so, because the weather was bad and we couldn't get to go to the beach or to a swimming pool. Yesterday the weather was pretty much ok and we went to a water park. As soon as we got there, we got into the pool and started taking underwater photos and shooting videos. It was ok, the lcd wasn't very visible 'cause of the sun, and the audio of the video wouldn't play (though I knew that it was made that way). So, after a couple of hours of using it and pluning into water and sliding down some rides, we turned of the camera and the screen begin to flicker. Then it went blank. Then it flickered again. We didn't know what to do or what happened. We looked every compartment to see if water had leaked or wtf could be causing that. We got into the internet and searched for the problem. It said that the camera should be left off for drying, so we remove the sd memory and the batteries, quit using it for 24 hours and waited. We just turned it on again, and it works perfectly! The screen doesn't flicker, nor goes blank. We downloaded the pictures and videos and it all looks pretty good (image and sound too!). It is a very good camera, nice, easy to carry in a swimsuit pocket and around your wrist. BUT that flickering thing freaked me out. I think it maybe had to do with some steam or sth. Like the camera got wet and because of the heat, there was steam inside it. IDK. The thing is, it is a very good product, but I'd be more comfortable with a product that doesn't behave that way. But I think that that's one of the risks of getting things via amazon living on the other side of the globe. It IS a good deal. You just have to be careful. I read every review for this camera at least twice before buying it and tried it anyway. I'm satisfied but not entirely. I hope this flickering thing was a just one time thing.","January 5, 2013",1
cameras,poor display illumination,"Edward ""Eddie P""",R13JRBOLYXWKM7,3,I bought this camera to take to the caribean and use while snorkeling. The led display is useless outdoors in the sunlight. You cannot make anything out on the display. There is no view finder so the the camera does not work in the daylight. It is better tho not much underwater. The display is difficult to see underwater. I was essentially guessing where I was aiming. Maybe that is expected from a low cost camera.The pictures are nice enough but since it is difficult to aim they are not always of what is expected,"May 3, 2012",1
cameras,Nice camera poor software,jd,RJX0G7ZFAPL1U,3,"i purchased this camera for my father for Christmas. He wanted a good digital camera that he could easily upload photos to the internet. the camera arrived quickly. It is super easy to use and comes with batteries. the problem came when attempting to load and use the software. the easyshare software claimed to be a one button upload to the location of your choice (email, facebook other social media)After attempting to load the software which should load automatically when plugging the camera into the computer, the software failed to load. after numerous attempts, i finally went to the kodak website and had to load the software from there. after doing that, the photos can be uploaded to the easyshare software and then later to the net site of your choice but they are not uploaded by pushing the ""one touch"" on the camera. It appears that button does nothing. i do not know if that is a camera issue or software issue but at any rate it does not work. As for the camera alone, it takes great pictures, does video, and is water proof and drop resistent. would have given 5 stars based on the camera and price if the software and the one touch function worked.","December 30, 2011",1
cameras,This camera EATS batteries!!,Michael LeFevre,R1YKNSTAOLH2TO,3,"We took only 82 pictures and had to put in 4 sets of AA batteries. During this time, the camera was off between uses. The underwater pictures were all right. It was great to have to use to take pictures of people snorkeling. A couple of times though, water must have gotten into the lense because I had six or seven pictures that look like they are foggy.","December 28, 2011",1
cameras,"Great camera for the price I guess, but...",Sean Knudsen,R2KPM1V3HGJLN8,3,"After just having used this camera to go snorkeling and seeing the results, I can say that this is a fair camera for the price. It stays watertight as advertized, I actually like that it uses AA batteries instead of a rechargeable since it's fast and easy to swap them out while on vacation, it takes nice clear regular pictures as well, with very good color quality, face detection seems to work great, etc.. The underwater features work great as well, and we got some very nice underwater video of the fish and coral, etc... Having said all that, however, the camera has some serious flaws. First, it apparently has no optical zoom whatsoever, it's all digital, which means it has no zoom at all, because the digital zoom is horrible. I would recommend not using it at all. Second, when shooting underwater, if you do use the zoom while you're recording video, the zooming mechanism is very loud and very noticeable when you play back the video on your computer. Sounds like something is hitting the camera twice every time you zoom in or out. Very very annoying... Not even sure why it happens since there is no optical zoom, but trust me it's there. The position of the mic is also poorly designed, as it's near the bottom corner and more than once I've found my finger covering it up while holding the camera underwater, and so when you play back the footage, it's like there's no sound. The built-in speaker is also very weak for video playback, if you're outside, good luck hearing it.So basically, it's good for the price point, especially since it's 12MP and it shoots underwater, but the lack of any zoom and the poor design of other components only merits 3 stars from me.","August 15, 2011",1
cameras,"Was a 5, now more like a 3",Kristina Weller,RM0RDM8POK8I7,3,"I really loved this camera when I bought it for a river rafting trip. It still works great in the water and takes decent pictures. (I Agree with someone that close up pictures aren't very good).However, the orange 2nd cover over the batteries (which is, I assume to keep water out of the batteries) won't click close. I've only had the camera 4 months. So, because it is Kodak, you have to connect it to the computer through a USB cable to get the photos off of it. Except you can't, because the spring-loaded orange cover won't stay closed! So I literally have to hold it close while the pictures are transferring. There's a little piece of plastic it appears that breaks off.Otherwise, it has been a good camera to me.","November 10, 2011",1
cameras,Waterproof for under 70 bucks....what should I expect?,tamastar69,R2Z9FOFFTFO7B8,3,It is indeed waterproof. I bought it a few weeks ago and it has been in all sorts of Michigan rivers and lakes since.The camera cannot handle bright light at all. If you take video and happen to catch a sun reflection off the water or something similar the image is ruined....like an old 35mm that got exposed to sunlight. Strange for sure but I'm guessing it has something to do with a cheap color encoder used to keep the price low.The zoom is worthless. I don't use it at all. The 12mp allows me to crop as needed and maintain an acceptable quality.You also cannot see the LCD in the sun so just buy a large SD card and snap a lot of photos. But a warning: you need to be patient as the cycle time between pictures is rather lengthy.If you need a camera to take with you when you don't want nice stuff to get damaged or lost - buy a camera like this.

The photo quality is decent, but inconsistent. Some of the ""dry"" photos are very nice, while others are just OK. The underwater photos are acceptable, but it's very tough to actually see what you're attempting to photograph (but I believe this is true of almost all underwater cameras).Shot-to-shot is very slow.

Many of the pics were better than my high end DSLR! I found myself opting to carry this little thing around rather than my expensive camera set with all the lenses and attachments. Now the bad news...Just a few weeks after returning home, the inner protective waterproof battery/mem card cover had it's small and flimsy retention clip break, so now the camera is no longer waterproof. I wasn't even doing anything to break it at the time. It just broke sitting there. Ingenious design, poor material used on the most critical of parts.Had not been for this, I'd have given it five stars!

We have yet to get through an entire snorkeling venture without killing the batteries...usually after 20 pictures or so.

It goes underwater, and I'm not afraid to take it on any of my outdoor adventures. But if you decide you'd like to zoom in on anything, you'd better find a different camera. The images are immediately pixelated when zoomed in at any magnification. The different settings make a little bit of a difference, but nothing profound. I was hoping for a few more capabilities (such as magnification or more manipulation with exposure), but I keep reminding myself what I payed for it and then I feel better. :)Like I said, I love taking it out in the kayak or swimming in a lake- no worries and it makes for fun memories.

But, the pictures posted here on amazon.com are quite superior to what you will usually get. That is why I am posting my own test pics to give some comparisons.I purchased this for my outdoor activities, right before the first trip to Grand Canyon for my novice companion. from day 1, I knew the picture quality was below average, not good enough for my grand trip. I decided to stop using it. And, when I returned, I brought it out to the beach(October heat wave, yay~!)near where I live.You will see the result of it. I cropped one or two pics, but, I did not use photoshop and you can see the candid images I took.____________1. Location - The beach scene is done around 12-3pm on Sunny October daytime.-Underwater pics are not impressive and most of the time, out of focus, and these pics are slightly better ones.-Whenever you switch 'on' the camera, the setting goes back to 'AUTO"" mode, and, the difference of the 'Auto' and 'Vivid' are shown(very yellow-tinted with Vivid, on the sandy hill background)____________Although I don't show it here, the 'self-portraight pics' with flash light(Strong sun-shadow contrast) tend to be the best feature of C123 as the pic results are almost as good as the other one with manual flashlight settings.And, the pics taken from the car, with 40+m/h speed, was decent.____________2. The Video mode,You can also see that the digital zoom is real joke and you will hear my unsuccessful zoom out click attempt, just like woodpeckers. And, the sun gets in the lens and the image is simply dull.3. location - Boat docking area, Butterfly, and plant closeup scenes are taken from my walk, around 4-5:30pm, on the following day in October, 2011.-Although the good composition and the nice objects, Sunset make the images look rich often, as you can see, it often darkens the image, and less saturated color, and, most of the time, it is not true to your eyes greatly.4. Close-ups and evening scenes are no,no.And, you should expect greatly compromised with the result if you use it to take picture for the ordinary day life. Exposure is inconsistent. And, I could not get the result that I could get from other higher-end cameras.I instantly noticed the cheap price means, their processor is probably from mid- to late- 1990s. My first digital camera of 1.2mega pixel has the similar quality then.5. The 'blue metalic paint' peels off from the first beach day and the body is white plastic underneath it.____________In conclusion,With its price under $70, I can't be complaining as I can explore more of the 'in the water,' situations- not under the water, really- i get the different angles of the distant landscape, walking into the Sea, or braving heavy rain storm seasons-For Now.This Kodak C123 will be a great toy for the young kids or a decent expansive option for unusual weather situation.","October 11, 2011",1

cameras,Decent camera for the price,Tracey,R1IRS13DVUFT3D,3,"I bought this specifically for our trip to WDW to use at Typhoon Lagoon and the resort pool. It's a pretty neat little camera and for the most part it held up well after 2 days at Typhoon Lagoon and a week in the resort pool. The only problems I encountered were the lens getting fogged up a couple of times and having to put it in the sun to clear it before I could take more pictures and that the sound ""disappeared"" from videos after being submerged in a wave at Typhoon Lagoon. All the videos taken prior to the ""wave"" video had sound including those taken under water in the resort pools, but then the sound actually disappears midway through the wave video and won't work anymore. For $65 though, I have no real complaints since I was able to get pretty good shots in Shark Reef and around the water park/resort. The photo quality is not as good as my regular Canon Powershot (and obviously not comparable to my D90), but for what I wanted it for, I thought it was a great deal on a pretty cool little camera!","August 7, 2011",1

Not a big deal if you are going to be using it around a pool, but if you want to capture good quality pics of marine life it can be hit or miss. Make sure to double check how the picture came out before swimming off somewhere. The camera performed reasonably for the price we paid, but if you want really nice underwater pics - don't hold your breath! Oh yeah one other thing to consider is sunlight.

cameras,Pros and Cons,"James Cormack ""Beefhearted""",R1XA37LZ8EL33N,3,"If you want a waterproof camera because you want to take pictures on or near water and not have to worry about getting it wet, this camera takes decent every day pictures, if you want a camera for taking pictures underwater it does take good pictures in good light without flash or in any light with flash. I have been a photographer for a long time, so I am kind of spoiled, I own a Canon 60D and 4 or 5 lenses, so I am used to things working for me. I took some snorkeling pics this week at Trunk Bay St John, USVI, I will post them for review. The irritating thing is that for some reason every few seconds now the camera just shuts itself off, or goes to sleep, and its not the battery, also underwater its very hard to see anything on the LCD screen so you can't tell if the camera is off or on, you just have to point and hope. One time I took about 20 pics underwater and did not even realize the camera was off. I have had it for about 18 months now so manybe its some kind of degredation of the camera??? SO the difficulty of seeing the screen underwater and out of water in bright light is a big disadvantage for me, I am used to an eyepiece and this drives me nuts. So for these things I am taking off two stars. Otherwise the picture quality is good, it takes nice everyday landscape and portrait pics, and good underwater pics, so three stars for that. Never had a problem with water or sand getting in it, still perfect in that respect. I'll post three pics from St John.","May 6, 2013",1

It has a fairly wide zoom range.Features are reasonably easy to find from the menu. Quality of images is often quite good. It has a few negatives. The chief is that the dynamic range could be better (blueskies are often not if the light range of the image is large). The battery life is not very long and the batter indicator doesn't seem to change until the batteryis almost out of power. And, it oddly doesn't have bracketing even though it easily adjusts for exposure or aperture and evenhas a low light mode that does multiple shots and puts them together. I would give it a 4 or even 5 stars if it weren't for the dynamic range. I likeblue and not white skies when they are blue.","September 5, 2011",1

cameras,Mixed Results,rusty,R1ZU50E36S92HR,3,"After reviewing the SX 130 for 60 days, I returned it due to soft image quality and purchased the SX 230. This camera has been a mixed bag of sorts for me, and it makes it difficult to write an evaluation.I desire to give it 5 stars for some of the impressive images I have taken with it, but problems with auto-white balance (and maybe exposure compensation, too) are causing me to downgrade this camera to three stars.Depending on the dial setting, I can take PASM shots on a tripod in controlled lighting and get different tint shades, and the photo brightness levels can vary quite a bit at times. Auto-mode works best, but I have seen times when an orange tint was present. Images shot in program mode usually come out looking too light, outdoors, and too dark indoors. I have resorted to taking a few shots - of the same subject - in several modes in order to find an acceptable image. I had no such troubles with the Canon SX 130.Image sharpness and detail is very good. This camera takes good movies, too, and I like the 16:9 screen for that purpose, but I wish the overall viewer height was a bit taller, as it makes it easier to see small wording - such as auto-ISO readings when shooting photos. Movie mode uses an auto-shake feature that works well. I recorded a few miles in stop and go city traffic while holding the camera with my right hand and driving with my left. I reviewed the 10-minute clip on TV without feeling motion induced eye fatigue. Be forewarned though, recording movie clips will drain the battery rather quickly, so I would encourage you buy a spare or two. http://www.amazon.com/1200mah-Battery-Replacement-PowerShot-Digital/dp/B000IWTHYA/ref=pd_sim_p_4There are too many bells & whistles to list them all, but one I like is the high burst mode. The SX 230 can take 8.1 images per second (non-flash mode) as long as you keep the shutter depressed. I shot a few seconds of my child in a rocking chair with said mode, and when I played the images back at high speed, it almost looked like a movie. Another good item is the auto-tracking feature in Auto mode. If selected (by a light press of the plastic rotating menu dial at the 12:00 O'clock position), a small white box will follow a moving object, and I sometimes use it to focus on a fixed background subject instead of letting the camera resort to using multiple green boxes to focus on foreground items.I think this is Canon's worst ergonomic camera. The flash location takes some getting used to as it wants to pop-up everytime the camera powers on, but light finger pressure will keep it retracted. If you find you need the flash, you can raise it manually with your fingernail, and lower it with the press of finger. The body finish has no anti-slip texture, and no raised finger placements, so be sure and wear the provided wrist lanyard in case the camera slips out of your hand (this happened to me once, and the lanyard kept the camera from hitting the floor).I have about two weeks left to review this model, and if I can't fix the white balance issue then I will probably send it back and buy the S95. A Canon rep talked like the white balance problem was a non-issue. What do you think? Is this the mark of a good camera? If it is, then why did I not have these issues with the SX 130? I don't mind changing things like exposure compensation for low-light shots, but I should not have to do this in normal lighting conditions in Program mode. Auto and Program mode should yield similar results if the shooting / camera parameters are the same, and so should Av, and Tv modes. (I wonder if CHDK could be of help here)For what it's worth, you can view three good images I took with the SX 230 here...[...]The four twilight images were taken with the SX 130.","January 22, 2012",1
cameras,yellowish white balance,Dr. Marko Rocznik,R3MD6B0GTI85M7,3,"Nice camery except for the white balance. All auto mode make pictures yellowish. There are also manual modes where you can manually set the white balance, but you lose all other automatic features as well.I was very happy with a FinePix F30 and hoped the SX230 could be a good replacement, but not with this color sensitivity!","January 8, 2012",1
cameras,"Powerful telephoto, but image clarity & battery life leave something to be desired",M. Rosewater,RR2RBUJWDCSN,3,"This is a good camera for its class. The lens is particularly impressive (macro, telephoto, low light, etc.). Gives you good auto as well as manual control, and very cool macro shots. Image quality and color really good, and video is excellent as well. Initially it met and exceeded my expectations and I gave it 5 stars, but then I discovered that often images appeared a bit washed out and not very crisp (even with careful ISO & Whitebalance settings) - something that was also a problem with an old (2004) Cannon PowerShot but never a problem with my old Sony CyberShot or my Canon Rebel SLR.Other telephoto cameras I was considering: Sony Cyber-Shot DSC-HX7V and 9V, because a number of years ago (2005)I remember Sony's CyberShot series having far superior image quality to Canon's PowerShot, but was put off by the reviews that the still image quality of the high-end DSC-HX9V is not that camera's strongest point (haven't actually tested that personally). In retrospect I probably should have gone with the Sony (although I don't know how I would have actually liked the new CyberShot).","December 24, 2011",1
cameras,Be aware of the pop-up flash - it gets in the way,"E. Barnes ""Never enough tools""",R271O0S5HGWNI0,3,"First off, I love Canon cameras and have gotten to the point where I will only buy Canon cameras (I tried a Sony and a Pentax/Lumix and the user interfaces were lacking). That said, my initial impression of this camera is that it is awkward to hold. The biggest issue is the pop-up flash: it gets in the way of your left hand when you hold the camera normally and always pops-up when you power on the camera. While you can push it down, there is a fairly strong detent that, if the manual hadn't specifically noted that you can manually push it down, I would have thought I was breaking it. I guess I may be a bit harsh giving the camera only 3 stars for this, but All of my other Canon cameras (I have owned a total of 5 digital Canon cameras) have been ergonomically superior to this one. I can't comment on the GPS feature and I just discovered last night there is a mode that captures a video snippet for each still picture so I'm intrigued by that (I just haven't played with it enough to make a judgement).Bottom Line: I'm on the fence for the first time with a Canon digital camera.P.S. If you're looking for a DSLR, I love my Canon T2i and highly recommend it. (But obviously this is for a totally different use model than the SX230.","December 1, 2011",1
cameras,"Lots of potential, but GPS was disappointing",Jim Chou,RSZAHC0M853PO,3,"First, the good: it takes great pictures. Low light performance is the best I've ever seen in a point & shoot, so the HS system does seem to do something. The zoom worked well, even during video, though I wish it were a little wider. The instant video from any mode was a great addition, and the controls were easy to use.It did seem harder to figure out some things than on other digital Canons I've owned (about 5 PS and 2 SLRs), I had to read the manual to figure out some things.The biggest disappointment was the GPS. In addition to being a major battery drain in logging mode, it was easily confused. While it worked well in the open outdoors, it did not work at all well in a city, even in locations where my iPhone and a dedicated GPS logger were easily able to get signals. At one point I had my logger (Locosys BGT-31) showing 12 satellites in view, 8 tracked, but the SX230 was unable to get a lock after 5 full minutes. This was very disappointing, since I think the addition of GPS is something that would be really useful, or at least cool.In summary, if you're looking for a PS this size, you could do worse (though perhaps you really want an SX210)... if you're looking for a camera with good built-in GPS, look elsewhere.","August 21, 2011",1
cameras,Choppy video at 1920x1080 /24p but excellent image quality,Byrna,R3MCWQPDH6Y8SD,3,"This camera has a very good low light performance, sharp and relatively noise-free photos and videos, even at higher ISOs (i.e. above 800, max. 3200) but the video frame rate is only 24 fps progressive at full HD (1920x1080) and this is definitely choppy. When you pan the camera horizontally or film fast moving objects like people walking quickly or close to the camera, or cars, there is a definite ""after-image"" choppy effect whereby one sees a ""trail"" of the moving object.However, on the good side, photos are very sharp, good colour and good exposure and so are the videos. This camera has very very good overall image quality for both and if it was not for the disturbingly choppy videos at full HD (on a class 10 SDHC memory card at 20MB/s transfer rate), I would recommend it. Canon needs quickly to get out a camera in this class of superzooms which is an upgrade to their SX30is model and upgrade their 1920x1080 video to 60p fps., their view screen to AT LEAST 461,000 pixels (the SX30is has 230,000 only even though HS230 has 460k... but the Sony HX100V has a whopping 921,000 pixel screen!) ONLY THEN, Canon will be a formidable competitor in all respects with the competition. The ONLY competition which stands out in this class is the SONY HX100V which can do 1920x1080 at 60p video and has excellent pixel sharpness, even at higher ISOs. The Sony is not available yet but it will be soon, in probably 2-4 weeks...","April 17, 2011",1

I find the photos from the 300HS are over-saturated and macro close-ups are very difficult to take. White balance is poor. Focus is different than my SD870IS so there's a bit of a learning curve to this 'new' processor.This is an Automatic Point and Shoot. Turn it on and take a snapshot.The settings menu is not as easy to navigate as previous Powershots and for space-saving they moved the Scenes from a dial to the menu which is a bit more effort to select night scene or pets or fireworks.. etc. There is a single switch to shift between fully AUTO and whatever you've set the scene, via the menu, to be.SUPER SLOW MOTION VIDEO is awesome!~ As are a few of the other scene options. The camera works great for the point and shoot and it's just the right size for my intended purpose. I need to have a camera with me at all times and this fits the bill.A screen protector on the LCD allows me to toss this in a bag or leave it lying in my vehicle console without worry. I'm on the fence about wether I would purchase this exact camera again, leaning toward no since I have grown accustomed to a Panasonic's impeccable focus (since my 870 died) and I definitely prefer the white balance of a Sony I have for Macro work - i.e., taking pics for eBay or product shots.Seems the 300HS is better suited for 'general' photography, like catching the sunset, taking pics of houses for work or catching your friends doing silly things. As with most of these little cameras, there is no telephoto and the 3-5x zoom doesn't do much at all.I vote middle of the road on this.. what was my favorite camera in the world and my 6th Canon Powershot.Update: I should have given this camera another star simply for the fact it can take pictures in incredibly low light without a flash. It is quite a remarkable little camera, but I still have issues with it. ...as my only camera which I carry with me and use nearly every single day.","January 31, 2012",1

We plugged it into a tv to show friends, that worked really well, video was good and battery life was good.

cameras,Good Not Great,Tierra,R355XRLB34M2WA,3,This camera is pretty good. It has a lot of different modes to shoot in with toy effect being my favorite. Going through the modes is easy to understand. The pictures come out pretty good. If you're looking to take professional pictures I would say go elsewhere. I use this for everything from random pictures or taking photos for my blog. You can see a shadow in the corner of your pictures where the flash can't get to because of the lens so take that in consideration before buying. I knew this beforehand so I wasn't shocked when I saw it. Readjusting to more light on the side where there would be a shadow sometimes helps; it gets annoying when it doesn't. I don't keep the battery in the camera when I'm not using it so I can't say exactly how good/bad it is but while using it with it in it works great. And unless I did something wrong there wasn't any sound while recording if you zoom in which really annoys me. Also there is a zooming noise you can hear.,"January 3, 2013",1

cameras,Great camera... get an extra warranty,"Jeremy dePrisco ""www.mindspeak.com""",R1BS6GHCLX7ABZ,3,"This is likely the best camera I have owned in this class. I am an amateur photographer, and I like the portability. I've got some great pictures from this camera on a number of vacations and for musical performances that I attend or where I perform. It doesn't do macro mode as well as my old 2.1 MP Fuji, but I can forgive that.Reason I can't give this more stars is that it has some design flaws. I've had two of these cameras so far - my original May 2011 purchase, then a replacement that was needed for spots on the lens from dust (Sept 2011). Canon warranty was good that time. But now (June 2013) I am getting ready to send it back because of the same problem and an additional flaw where the shutter doesn't close all the way. Problem is, now it is out of warranty, and I don't know if they will be as forgiving.This camera sucks up dust incredibly quickly. Even though I keep mine in a case most of the time, it seems there some flaw with the casing or the telescope lens that just encourages dust to get inside. You can NOT put this think in the pocket of your kaki's and expect it to remain dust free. Kind of kills the portability.A repair right now is $160. The camera is going for $175 new on Amazon.

cameras,Good Camera - check in fresh water first,Daniel F. Lynch,R3F5H4SQOMCRH4,3,This is a very well built camera with excellent features...but. I took it it on a recent cruise and tried it under water (very brief) a few times with no problems. I always rinsed it in fresh water when returning to the ship and was extremely careful when opening and closing battery door. Then I took it snorkeling (same trip) and was under water for 10 to 15 minutes ay a time. When I came out of the water it stopped working. When I opened the battery door I noticed there were droplets of water inside. I knew right away the camera was toast as salt water does not play well with electronics. I then tapped the camera on my hand and more more droplets came out. Fortunately I had another camera with me on the trip (not waterproof).I want to stress that I was extremely careful in following all instructions on using this camera. I'm assuming I just got a defective one. Amazon took it back and gave me a full refund. Excellent service from Amazon as usual. I would still highly recommend this camera but I would highly suggest you immerse it in FRESH water and leave it submerged for awhile. I'd also move it around like you are swimming. Then open the door up and tap it on your hand lightly to make sure no water comes out.I have not replaced this camera yet but will probably just buy the same one again and do some testing first.Dan,"September 1, 2011",1

The underwater pictures were crisp, and minimal glare. However, the camera stopped functioning altogether after the second use underwater. It regained function after a few days, but I decided to return it for a replacement. Maybe this was just a one-of-a-kind software glitch, since no water appeared to have penetrated the camera.

Despite carefully reading and following the cleaning instruction before getting the camera wet, it flooded after first contact with water. Amazon accepted the return without quibble and substituted with new camera. This one has been waterproof up to now including scuba diving to the advertised depth of 10 meter. When doing so, the LCD display shows a large pressure point in the middle that disappears again when surfacing. The same can't be said from the microphone, this has not survived the scuba diving and only registers the loudest sounds over an irritation permanent noise rendering the video function useless.Picture quality is reasonable, optical zoom range is limited by the waterproof casing.Strong points are the sturdy construction and extensive features that allow plenty of experimenting for a child.","September 17, 2013",1
cameras,Impressed but not so waterproof,Amazon Customer,RA4KO86J8ETRB,3,"*** 7 Months Later ***Still going strong. The minor salt water incursion has not affected anything, except my willingness to take the camera below a few feet depth. Never tried to return it as there's nothing wrong. All functions working well, no new problems. Have traveled all over the place with the camera just thrown in my backpack, and it doesn't seem to mind at all. The GPS has proved to be weak compared to my iPhone or outdoors GPS unit, but with a good sky view it works well.*** Update to first part (which appears below)***After a week's vacation...Took the TS3 to the Caribbean for various activities on the beach, in the water, and on land. I'm still impressed with the image quality and overall performance. Video is very nice too. I took it along on two beach trips, just into the water but not at any depth, with the accompanying sand and dirt. Followed the prescribed rinse / dry / seal cleaning with the included brush and no problems.BUT, then I went snorkeling with it to depths of 15 - 20 feet (half the rated level) for about 45 minutes. Got great stills and videos that live up to the claims. Upon returning to the boat I took the camera to the head and soaked / lightly rinsed followed by shaking off excess moisture and drying. When I tried to use it about 10 mins later the screen started to flash and it would not take photos. I immediately opened the door with it positioned down so any liquid would drain away from the battery / card, and found a drop or two of water in there that had gotten onto the USB / Video connectors; there was visible corrosion. I blotted up the drops, removed the battery and SD card,and closed it up. On returning to my room a couple of hours later I carefully swiped off the contacts with a slightly moistened piece of stiff paper, which removed the visible corrosion. After an hour of drying with the door open, the camera again works fine. No water had penetrated to the battery or SD contacts or into the bulk of the camera, but just the same this was not what I expected. Thus I docked a star from my rating.I will attempt a warranty repair / replace, but I don't think I'll take it below a foot or so of depth after this experience (which is similar to others have reported here). Even though I followed the instructions it failed anyway.*** Original Review ***Only had it for 24 hours, but I wanted to write down my initial impressions. I purchased the Panasonic Lumix DMC-TS3 and a Transcend 16 GB Class 10 SDHC card to replace my older Nikon Coolpix S560 point and shoot purchased in 2008. Well, no comparison really. The technology has advanced considerably in the 3 years since I got the Nikon. I paid just about the same for the Nikon in 2008 as for the TS3. For a quick comparison, I took the same composition on both cameras, flash and without flash, and the TS3 comes out light years ahead in resolution, color quality, lack of fringing and jpeg side effects, etc., let alone the video, location features, and many more. So, onward to the new camera, old one goes off to auction somewhere or maybe I'll give it to my daughter.Played with the TS3 a little taking shots and videos of the dogs, just to get the feel of it. The user interface is similar to the Nikon and many other cameras of this type, so I had no problems learning the basics. I haven't dunked it in the pool yet; that will wait for the next warm weather water opportunity. But I did take it on a hike today to test the GPS and Intelligent Auto mode. For the most part GPS was pretty accurate. I took along my 'real' outdoors GPS receiver that I know is accurate to less than 10 feet or so, and then compared the GPS metadata in the pictures by plotting waypoints for each picture overlaid on the GPS track of the 3-mile or so hike with my spouse and our dogs. She took the pictures and turned the camera off and on a few times, with the GPS set to 'always on.' Most of the 20 or so photos were spot on, but one came out positioned about 50 feet northeast of the track. Then the GPS seemed to stop working, and the last few jumped to a single point about 15 miles southeast of the true position. Not sure what happened there; nothing different about tree cover or clouds, and the outdoors receiver continued to work. Could have been related to turning the camera off long enough for the GPS to deactivate, and then not waiting long enough after powering back on to get a good fix. We didn't look at the displayed GPS status so it's hard to say. Next time I'll try to pay more attention. Anyway, GPS seems to work very well when it was working and properly initialized.Intelligent Auto mode had no problem switching to macro mode when close to some mushrooms, and the rest of the photos of medium to long-range objects were fine. The flash functioned well on macro and normal shots. Overall exposure was accurate, although underexposed by ~ 1/2 stop. Auto white balance was correct for the overcast day.Leaving GPS on almost all the time, taking about 50 photos (maybe 40% flash) and around 10 mins of HD video, the battery is less than half used.Overall I'm very satisfied with the DMC-TS3 performance. Next challenge -- using it underwater or in other adverse conditions where I wouldn't dare take my SLR. Oh, now I need to find a vacation...","November 26, 2011",1
cameras,Great functionality but it fogs up.,Jason Norgan,R3NGPYZJBL08S3,3,"I purchased this product about a year ago, and was very excited to use it. I must admit it is extremely versatile, both stills and video are great quality. However, I experienced issues when transitioning from water to dry elements. The camera fogged up and did not clear for some time. All images taken afterwards were foggy, basically worthless. At first I thought it was just an isolated incident, but when exposed to the same conditions the issue repeated. I have double checked the seals, and cleaned the camera as directed, but I keep experiencing fogginess after removing the camera from the water. Utilizing the camera in either environment by itself is fine, just don't expect to be able to use it about 15 minutes after getting out of the water.","April 21, 2013",1
cameras,"YEP. It does leak, but seems to recover...",polishp,R2MLI35GCR7N0M,3,"We bought this specifically for snorkeling on our honeymoon. I followed all the directions regarding the seal and care and preparations and after care regarding soaking and drying. On the first swim, about a few hours after we got out, the playback function started getting wonky, flashing something about the dimensions of the AV input. It seemed to go away after it dried out a bit. Each swim got progressively worse, a few hours out of the water, it would have playback errors, then eventually shut off all together. At one point the lens seemed to fog from the inside. But after sitting for a day, with silica pellets inside the battery cavity, it made a full recovery. On one of the later failures, I did open the hatch to see what was up, and found the A/V port to be corroded and crusted. Salt water definitely got in, which explains the flickering playback messages. Luckily it did't get to the card or battery. So we got lucky...The camera takes excellent macro shots, which is one of the reason I got it. And the pics we got while snorkeling were awesome. Wish we could have used the camera everyday without it's ""time outs"".Just be prepared for issues with the waterproof quality. But I still like the camera.","April 2, 2013",1
cameras,not bad at all... not the greatest,"Petr Marecek ""glados""",R22CQJI3CH2PGR,3,"This is a replacement for my stolen Sony Cybershot camera. I have 2 kids so I was looking for something rugged they drop and step on and that I can take to the beach and shoot them playing in rain splashing mud around. As far as ruggedness goes, it's been exposed to all of the above and held up pretty well (6 months in) as I took good ""aftercare"" described in the manual.The picture quality is average. It doesn't have a lens cover so if you take one picture in rain and a drop dries off on your lens and you don't wipe it off and go on a weekend trip, you'll have 50 smeared pictures. In low light, it's kind of grainy and the flash is not the most powerful. And the video in low light is just sub par. The video is otherwise decent but the width of capture is not quite as wide unless you're standing at a good distance. Underwater looks pretty good. The zoom buttons are somewhat awkward, definitely preferred the zoom ""lever circle"" on the Cybershot.Battery life is average. Size is not the super compact but not too big. Looks are great.It is slow. Sometimes it takes 3+ seconds before taking another picture with flash on. And from off position to start shooting a video easily takes 5 seconds which with 2 hyper kids makes you sometimes miss the best action shots.Overall, not a bad camera. You can certainly find a better point and shoot for similar or lower price.If you like rugged and don't mind extra steps and waiting time, add a star.","May 16, 2012",1
cameras,"Good with the right settings, but not great",NaturePhotog,R1GRKSINYOJJW,3,"I purchased this camera primarily for snorkeling excursions. I've used it several times now in the Bahamas and Bermuda. I was also able to use it while scuba diving this year.I followed the instructions meticulously about preparing the camera for use underwater, and for cleaning when out of the water. I've had no problems with leaks and it's been over a year.The ""intelligent auto"" setting of the camera did fairly well. It recognized when I was photographing a person and switched to portrait mode. It also switched to macro mode when doing a close up of a flower, and landscape mode while taking pictures of a small island from a boat.The camera has several other pre-set modes, including one for beach/snorkel, and a second for underwater. According to the manual, underwater mode is used when going deeper than 40 ft, with the use of an underwater housing. Beach/snorkel mode is used for depths less than that. I found that these modes do not work that way.Using snorkel mode while in a 4 foot pool of clear water in bright sunshine, the camera took very good pictures, both above and below the water. The video turned out very clear as well. However, during beach and reef snorkels, despite the bright sun, any pictures under the water have a very noticeable blue-green look, like they were taken through a cloud on turquoise gas. They are in focus, but the colors are washed out. I assume that the camera's mode is trying to adjust for the loss of light and the color shift as you go deeper, but even near the surface, the pictures were not very good. Out of the water (on the surface and in a boat), the pictures were fine and the colors were accurate.Switching to underwater mode made a huge difference. The camera still did well on the surface using the underwater mode, but the underwater photos were bright and clear. Both snorkeling, with the camera from inches to a few feet under the water, to scubaing, down to about 25 feet below the water, the photos were clear, sharp, and colorful. If you will using the camera under any water besides a swimming pool, I would recommend only using underwater mode.The largest liability of the camera is its LCD. While on land or the water's surface, it is easy to see the LCD, read all the icons to see the settings, and make any adjustments. Underwater it is a different story. The LCD becomes nearly useless when looking through a snorkel mask underwater. Holding the camera at half an arm's length, the LCD was only a light blob with no detail at all. If you held it right up to your face, you cold see it, but then you couldn't see around it. I wasn't always sure I had my subject fully in the photo. When zooming, it was nearly impossible the be sure what you were actually photographing. Even having the camera at a slight angle caused the subject to be partially out of the frame. Consequently, I used much less zoom than I wanted for many subjects.The camera is far from perfect. However, I don't want to spend the money for a waterproof housing for my DSLR. So, as a compromise, this is OK. If you are planning on using this more at the pool, on the beach, in a boat, or other areas where you want the safety of a rugged camera, this is a good choice. If you spend a lot of time in the water, this may not be the best choice. However, I don't know that there is a great choice in point and shoot underwater cameras right now. With the right settings, the pictures are good, but the limitations of the LCD are a barrier to many shots. Overall, I am happy I have this camera, but I will continue to look for a replacement.","August 9, 2012",1

I mean, it takes great shots, feels solid, and stands up to the scrutiny Nikon owners have for their gear.HOWEVER...It is very menu intensive and doesn't have the ability to store settings profiles.Every time you need to change settings you have to take you eyes off your subject/environment and sift through menus on the LCD.

cameras,"Shocked, yet amazed at the same time!",Mykers,R1IGJD0C09NOZZ,3,"Hello all,Please read ""oz zy ""waiting for the dvd"" review first before you continue with mine....Alright folks after two full days of accurately testing the Nikon Coolpix AW100 camera, I feel it's time for a partial review:A little background, I wanted a rough and tough camera that I could put to the test physically. I have two young children and pictures are the greatest way to capture wonderful moments. Nonetheless, low-light conditions were always a huge problem in our house.First, the picture quality is great. I just came from a Canon elph 7.1 MP camera. After shooting a total of 232 pictures on the Nikon, the quality is much better can Canon respectively, and obviously. The one thing that most individuals will not like is the lack of options to manipulate the lighting effects. The Nikon itself is made for dummies- and I use this loosely. I do not intend to placate anyone as a ""dummy."" I am merely stating the obvious once you have this camera in your possession.Moving forward with the quality, I have read some reviews stating that low light conditions really aren't that great. I do beg to differ, I come from a Townhome that is very dark and all low light pictures came out great once you select, ""the low light feature"", or select auto, which in turn will automatically select low-light conditions. The low-light pictures come out good, not great. Most cameras out there like the Sony TX10 (I think) did not perform well in this aspect.As for the video quality, it is indeed good. The HD video on this camera is the reason I gave it three stars. The reason for my rating, is not the quality it's the zoom (please refer to Oz zy's review). Once you start recording, the low light conditions I feel are really good. My videos came out decent enough for me wanting to keep the camera. I had also tested the Sony TX10, and I thought the Nikon was much better.Now onto the zoom! Once you depress the zoom button you are in for a big surprise. Of course, this surprise does not reveal itself until playback. It appears like oz zy has stated, you indeed hear the zooming from the lens which sounds like a cat purring. On my camera alone, the zoom sounds louder (quite a shock). Furthermore, this was only half the problem. The other problem I encountered was depressing the zoom button alone. Once depressed, you can hear a loud knock or bump (describing it verbally is difficult) each time you press either zoom button. This alone sounds aweful. IF you attempt to film a quiet seen, this will be the only annoying noises you will hear.I was shocked when I heard how loud the zoom, and buttons were on playback. There is a positive in all of this, I guess- It appears the microphone on this unit is very strong and accurate. Almost to strong in a sense to be troublesome depending on how you view this. The only other reason I can think of these noisy buttons is because the unit is waterproof...The unit/casing is very sturdy. My wife is under 5 feet, and she is prone to accidents (sorry sweetheart). After about 12 minutes of her testing the camera, WHOOPS she dropped it. The Nikon made a thud on the floor, and she looked at me with fright. She was surprised that the camera was unscathed and was able to resume its duties in this house.Following this, I had sub-merged the camera in water 2 separate times: the first, in about one foot of water for 6 minutes, the second, 8 feet of water for 12 minutes. Both times the camera came out fine. I did test a couple of basic pictures underwater and they appeared fine. (please note, Nikon recommends you have the camera serviced once a year because the gaskets that help lock out the water where the battery/memory cards are located can wear).All in all the camera was a good pick up. Again, I was unimpressed the with functionality or lack of with the zooming and buttons on playback. I also want to reassure you that not using zoom for the video recording looks great, and performs very well with the Nikkor lens. I am NOT an expert reviewer so please be gentle upon posting comments. Hopefully, this will help some individuals decide whether or not this is the right camera for them. In the meantime, my rating of three stars still stands.","November 9, 2011",1
cameras,Excellent!,D. Faulkner,R34J2PLSRJQQAP,3,"It holds charge well, has a fast shutter for a point and shoot. Nice effects. Waterproof-shockproof-but not sand proof. Be care with this thing on the beach. We took it to Pictured rocks and the photos are great, but if you get sand in the navigation controls its will mess with the controls until you clean it out.3 stars for poor menu setup, its a pain trying to find the menues since the menues are contextual based on where you are in the camera.

Daylight photos turned out great!- Decent battery life... we recharged it each night and it was fine for the next day of moderate usage.- GPS tagging is cool.Cons:- Could have an easier menu and navigation system.- Can be confusing with the different buttons.. you have to configure the button on the side to be GPS, etc.- Does not take very good pictures in low-light. We didn't have much luck with low-light scenarios.- Battery charger is bulky. Our Canon has a small wall plug-in charger that it very convenient.

cameras,Size - Shape - Function is just ok,Boise Nelson,R364Q3DZ5IC4S5,3,"I got this as our family does lots of active outdoor adventures together (rafting, snow skiing, boating, mtn biking, hiking, camping, etc.). I felt this product would offer solid solution in price/size/toughness for us. I was not expecting DSLR quality photos but did expect better pic quality then we are getting. It is very touchy leaving minimal room for error on taking photos and that you must really slow down on getting the 'hold button half way down' before taking photo. This does help on static photos but action photos are often blurry, even when using the 'Sports' setting. I am finding the best method is to put into continuous mode and hope that 1 out of the 20 or so that get exposed turn out. Somewhat disappointed here.Other then that I love everything else, the size, waterproof, etc. In fact the kids take photos frequently in the pool and this function has surprisingly been better then expected. Overall if you want 'decent' photos on a camera that is easy to carry around then this one works for you.","October 1, 2013",1
cameras,"Great for snorkeling video, outdoors, so-so still picture quality",Chris Ukes,R1WOY0TKIE3LIL,3,"If based on snorkeling, water parks, and underwater pool shots/video, I'd give it Five Stars.But the image sensor has difficulty with dynamic range and sharp focus in still images...in short, no better than an average smart phone, precisely because it has a cellphone sensor and lens system... 1-Star, inconsistent image quality. Adjusting the exposure down on-camera or using a neutral density filter w/ the filter attachment helps, but isn't foolproof either. The new AW110 update has the same sensor and lens, so CAVEAT EMPTOR.The GPS feature also gets 5-stars and is the best of all current manufacturers. In Hawaii, it tagged coordinates to each photo, as well as, the locations name - very nice!!! The unique map viewer feature is also neat when hiking in parks, etc. No other manufacturer features a GPS map viewer!I paid less than $200 on clearance for the AW100 w/o regret, but would recommend the Olympus TG-2 in the $350 range over the AW110 for an all-purpose waterproof camera - the sensor/lens system of the Olympus is much better.One tip: If shooting fish underwater, taking snapshots from video on computer yields the best results.","April 17, 2013",1

cameras,"Great underwater performance, awful GPS",Praty,R1XIKWN4K1QWJI,3,"I own other point and shoots: I bought this for underwater use and geo tagging.Underwater performance is very good. It switches to underwater mode on its own - and it is a breeze to use, even for children.I was really disappointed by the GPS - it is virtually useless. It locks only 20% of the time, and takes several minutes to lock if it does- which it promptly loses the moment i switch it off. It feels they have squeezed in a 10yr old GPS chip just for the sake of it. I have several SD card-sized dedicated GPS units for use with my nikon DSLRs, and they are very dependable (they lock in 30 seconds, and work even inside the airplane). I would not buy this unit if you are keen on geo tagging pictures.I wish they had a more reliable GPS in the unit- given the $200 premium to similar 'ordinary' cameras.","February 19, 2012",1

I ordered it without checking further (my bad), only to found out that I could buy the next model HIGHER (with Wireless connectivity) for about $50 LESS through Amazon.

It takes very nice photos and videos. The size is small so carrying it is easy and convenient. Image stabilization is excellent. It works well and takes good photos and videos under a few feet of water. You can take excellent photos during rain.There are also some limitations with this and many other waterproof cameras. The controls have little travel, are too numerous, and are too close together. The zoom control is inconvenient.The menus of the Nikon AW 100 are hopelessly misleading, complex and slow to respond.Battery life is poor with 200 shots max. Buy extra batteries!Finally, do not buy aftermarket batteries for this camera because they will likely not operate the flash unit.

laptops,Powerful Laptop BUT! UPDATE,Arcturus08,RS914W9QWWUM2,3,This Laptop is great! The i7 processor is a beast and it has enough RAM to not get bogged down. The GPU is powerful enough to play Modern Warfare 2 and Bad Company 2 with all video controls on high! The only thing that some will find as a con is the size. The ASUS G73 is very thick and bulky but that thickness allows room for its kick butt cooling system! All and all I'm very pleased with my laptop purchase and with all of my dealings with Amazon. I would recommend this laptop to any computer nerd or PC gamer but it may be a little too much machine for a novice.***Update: 6/6/12 Sending my Laptop back to Asus for the 2nd time in 3 months. Something in the GPU or Motherboard has failed two separate times and led to green flashing pixels and an unusable display. Sent it back in April they replaced the motherboard and that lasted for 2 months. So far everything has been ok with Asus Customer Support but this is getting ridiculous. I thought ASUS was a quality brand... I've been using their Motherboards for years. Maybe they are just not as good at notebooks.Reduced from 5 stars to 3... figured 3 was fair since they are fixing it.... If not it would be a 1!Still love Amazon Prime tho!,"July 13, 2011",1
laptops,"A Mixed, Mixed Bag",Informer3X,RNB7VBOF34CRO,3,"Times like this, I wish that the Amazon rating system was out of 10 rather than out of 5. I feel this is more of a 3.5/5 than anything else, but that being said, I'd like to provide a bit of insight, having owned this computer for about a month-and-a-half now.The first thing anyone will probably notice about the notebook is its design. It's a sleek, matte black, arguably minimalist and perhaps even understated. Yes, I've had people compare it to a stealth fighter, but I personally enjoy the low profile, so to speak. It's no where near as flashy as Dell's Alienware, but it's not supposed to be. On the other hand, yes, it is large, about the size of a typical 17-inch laptop. It's probably a tight squeeze with most 17"" cases--as a note, I managed to squeeze it into Targus's 15"" case, but I have yet to ascertain how. Be aware that it is substantially thicker in the rear where the vents are located than in the front.Concerning hardware, the laptop is top-of-the-line, with a Sandy Bridge i7 Quad-Core processor, 6 GB of RAM (or 8 GB in some models), a 7200 RPM 500 GB hard drive, and a GTX 460M, plus a 1080p screen, all of which is denoted in the description. A few notes on this: there are four RAM slots, two of which will be filled (with either 3 GB or 4 GB modules), so you can take advantage of the incredibly low RAM prices and add up to (presumably) 24 GB of RAM. Be advised though, the BIOS is notoriously finicky, so your mile WILL vary. On the plus side, the laptop can accommodate a second hard drive (mine came with a second hard drive mount pre-installed into the second hard drive bay; apparently some others have not). Apart from that, the monitor is acceptable, though I had to toy with the settings a little to get the colors right.If benchmarks mean anything to you, you can comment and I'll respond to you personally; I don't feel like cluttering this review up with dozens of numbers. Suffice to say, the processor is *almost* on par with the first-gen desktop i7 920, and it'll tackle most any calculation you throw at it, including sophisticated systems modeling with MATLAB. The GPU is excellent, if an energy hog, and it is very good for gaming, even at 1080p resolution; you should be able to play on ""high settings"" with easy, and reasonable anti-aliasing, anisotropic filtering, etc. It also accelerates all variety of media processing, whether conversion, decoding, and editing. I've found it to be acceptable for rendering, but not optimal; however, it can be overclocked by around 20-25% with no stability issues, quite the feat. RAM and hard drive, well, that's up to what you do, but I've found them both adequate.The chiclet keyboard takes some getting used to, and it may feel crammed if you have big hands/fingers, but the backlighting is nice. I found the lack of dedicated volume controls problematic, but not a deal-breaker. In other news, there's a single ethernet port, a VGA and HDMI output, three USB 2.0 and one USB 3.0, a mic and headphone jack, and a card reader. Again, minimalist, but I haven't found myself desiring more. The webcam is surprisingly high-quality, on par with Logitech's mid-range models. The speakers are tinny and a bit of a disappointment. Sure, laptops aren't renowned for their audio quality, but it feels as if Asus's engineers didn't even make an attempt. You may also feel that the track-pad buttons are stiff, but it is not difficult to get used to. On the plus side, I'm actually amazed at how cool this stays, even when running the CPU and GPU at near 100% load.Battery life is around three hours if the computer is kept to a minimal state (for typing or limited productivity work). It is around two hours if a number of intensive applications are running at once, and around one hour if gaming.This alone, the laptop should easily qualify for four stars, perhaps even five. There are two significant barriers in the way:1. The bloatware this laptop comes with could capsize an SSD, much less and HDD. It slows the computer down substantially if not removed, a process which takes at least an hour, if not more. And the restoration disks they ask you to burn still include the bloatware, not to mention taking up a half-dozen DVDs. I highly advise a fresh installation before doing anything else with the laptop, using the Windows install key found underneath the laptop. With just removing the bloatware, the underlying system is inherently unstable afterwards--a month-and-a-half in, I've experienced significant slow-downs, and am now running off of a second hard drive I installed, with a clean Windows installation. Which gets me to the next point:2. Accessing any hardware on this laptop actually requires a teardown. Why, Asus? Every other laptop I've owned has an easily accessible hard drive and RAM; just flip over the laptop, undo one or two screws, and voila, you can swap the hard drive or change the RAM. For this one, you have to remove the keyboard and the panel with the trackpad, undo three ribbons and about a dozen screws, than finally prob open the back panel to get to the guts of the laptop. It may sound simple, but it's a cautious, time-consuming process, and absolutely should not have been designed so absurdly. Just to add a RAM stick, you would risk rendering your keyboard and trackpad inoperable, and possibly damage the motherboard.So that's about it. I haven't experienced the power button or the power jack issues others have described, but despite its great value, the Asus G53SW is a purchase which demands caution.","January 7, 2012",1

When I got it back, the screen was badly misaligned when the laptop was closed so after I complained about it they tried several more times to fix it. Finally they had to replace the screen again but it was still not aligned properly like it was when I purchased it. They then told me it was all they could do and they would not do any more to fix it. The technician said It was a common problem but only cosmetic so I am out of luck. I though Apple products were supposed to be higher quality than this. My wifes cheapo budget laptop has a better screen and its aligned properly. She makes fun of me for wasting my money to but this one. I am not really impressed with the quality of the product or service at this point. Way overpriced for what you get.Other than that, it still works reasonably well. I do like that its light and thin. Its also pretty fast thanks to the SSD. Not sure I will buy a Mac again though after this experience. I do like the Mac OSX though, just not impressed with the hardware. I might just have to make a hackintosh after this one.I am an IT specialist and have experience with a great deal of different computers and laptops and I can say there is nothing special about this one. Should have spent my money on a more powerful windows laptop instead for the same price.","January 10, 2013",1
laptops,beautiful computer but too small,Danielle,R3RUO0EXY2U334,3,"This is a beautiful computer. It is thin, light, does not overheat. No radiation heat headache or skin burn from this computer. You don't even miss the disk drive. When you think about it, everything is downloaded now. Disks are not used that often, and when they are needed, there is the option of an inexpensive external disk drive.It's simply an amazing computer. Turns on in seconds when you gently tap the button. Super fast. Quiet. I can't say enough good things about this computer. I love it but needed to return it because the print was very small and not adjustable in some areas. The toolbar print is ridiculously small and not adjustable. Web text is adjustable. But for me, no matter how many times I changed the font or adjusted the resolution, my eyesight was not good while using this.I also found I was needing an extra port that was not there. No big deal. The positive definitely outweighs any small amount of negative with this computer and it will be great for anyone that uses it. This is the perfect travel computer. I did not want to return it, but I just felt it was too small. I'm really hoping apple will release a 15"" Macbook Air. I love the design of this computer I just wish they offered a larger screen size.","June 29, 2012",1

laptops,"Great portability, not so great guts..",bmckinney,R33ZKRZBXLCZTQ,3,"I have owned many macs over the years, and I might have made a quick jump on this one. I purchased the 11"" this past October, and I am already to go back to my macbook pro. The first thing you notice when you get it, is the screen, it is definitely made of a different material, and it doesn't have nearly the same quality as the macbook pro does. The memory that comes stock on these is also not the best. I am not to worried about the disk drive, as it is almost 2013 and you really don't need anything to read a disk, cause you can get it mainly online now days. It is definitely light, and very portable, but I would suggest for anyone to spend a couple hundred bucks more and purchase the macbook pro. It comes with better processor, better built in memory, and a lot better looking of a screen, it is by far my favorite mac product ever made.","December 17, 2012",1
laptops,"Not an Mac Air-Killer, but not bad",Nick Miller,R1U6MZTFQA9DRD,3,"Let me start by saying that our home is all on the 'dark-side' and we have any number of Apple-based computers. I still wanted a mobile, small, lightweight PC to use with software that comes in PC form. The Aspire S3 comes close - far from perfect, but it will do for what I need. The form-factor is nice - I especially like the aluminum lid - but he rest of the machine does feel pretty plasticky - it is really a plastic body, with an aluminum sheet on the lid. It does not carry the robust feel of my Macbook Air - so I sometimes feel I have to treat it somewhat gingerly. Everything works fine (once you remove all the bload-ware that comes pre-loaded) - I was a bit surprised by how often the heat fan kicks in even when doing the most basic tasks. The battery life is at best 'OK' - so far I am lucky to get much more than a couple of hours out of it when browsing or word-processing. Would not call it lightning fast - resume from sleep is fast, but performance is again 'OK'. There are a couple of things I don't particularly like about the design - first the touchpad is on the one hand way to sensitive - it's easy to move the cursor or accidentally click while typing or moving around the screen. On the other hand the touchpad is a bit stiff when you want to right-click - you really have to press quite hard - which is especially difficult when trying to select a region. If you use a mouse, it is much easier. The other thing I don't care for in the design is the positioning of the USB ports at the back. They are stiff (tough to get the cables in and out) and they are too close to the power cable - which has a big old connector that gets in the way. You have to arrange the cables in such a way that the machine sits flat on the desk. For $900 it is a bit on the pricy side when compared to what you can get from Apple (admitedly their equivalents are over $1000) - so if I were chosing I would probably save for a couple more months and spring for the Mac. Peformance-wise you can get the same for much less than $900 in the PC world - but if small form-factor and relative light weight is a big deal, then this machine is pretty good. In short, you are paying to for the cool 'Air-like' look - but that look is pretty superficial - a bit like having a sexy Mustang, but with a Ford Focus engine in it.","November 7, 2011",1
laptops,Not 3 lbs...,Cee H,RL6B645LHOFMW,3,"Revised: Acer Aspire S3-951-6646 Ultrabook I took off 1 star for a heavy charger & another for a wonky keypad. I originally took 2 stars off because I bought this for travel and weight was a primary consideration-- It was advertised as 3.1 lbs, but discovered the charger cord with it's brick and heavy 3-prong plug weighed in at a whopping 12 oz. so the real weight nearly 4 lbs. I also have to carry an 2-prong adapter for the 3-prong plug which makes it heavy, cumbersome and needs about 4 in. clearance from the wall. Some companies (Samsung & Apple) are making cords with small or no transformers.After using this for 2 months, I think it's worth noting that I did travel with this machine for a month and did not find the weight too inconvenient. I did, however, discover that I needed a mouse because the keypad is seriously spastic--pointer and pages jump all over the place--however it performs fine with a mouse. Battery life is realistically 3-4 hrs.Pros: Nice size, good wifi range, fast, nice screen resolution, stays cool.Cons are:Â· no ethernet connection to hardwire broadband (haven't found this to be a problem)Â· cord with a heavy 3 prong plug and transformer brick adds another 12 oz.. spastic keypadBottom Line: Overall I'm very happy with my new ultrabook, and given the price considerations, I do not regret my choice and would recommend it.","January 14, 2012",1

laptops,By itself it is okay but not worth more than 300 dollars.,Samuel,R1EE20O5IIASZW,3,"I bought this laptop at an insanely nice price from staples when it was on clearance. I replaced the hard drive with a solid state drive, replaced the terrible wireless card and the sub par fan. I luckily spent only $100 dollars on these extra parts on black Friday. The laptop I paid $210 for at Staples. It runs incredibly with all of the new updates but with the factory wireless card, you are going to have some troubles.The wireless card: Drops signals randomly and will not work until you reboot the computer.The hard drive: I put it in an extra external hard drive enclosure and it died on me within four months.This computer is not worth it unless you understand how to upgrade a laptop. The parts are cheap. But for the price I bought it for such a small and light laptop I cannot complain.","January 12, 2013",1

laptops,Zenbook beautiful but poor quality control,NYC outlaw,R3FNX3WCBPJK0U,3,"I've been waiting forever for Windows laptops to finally catch up with the form factor/design of the Macbook Air. This time Intel and its partners deliver!I've owned a Macbook Air for the last 2 years and I definitely prefer this laptop to that Macbook Air (to be fair I don't have the current generation Macbook Air).The Asus Zenbook which looks like a macbook air Clone online does not look like a clone of the mac air except for the form factor. The brushed metal look is definitely classier in person than it looks online. As far as performance goes -- so far it's been great. The instant on actually works (finally Microsoft!), the audio BLOWS away the audio on macs and is wonderful. The laptop does not seem to heat up while on my lap or on the sofa -- but I've only had it for 2 days.My only criticism of the laptop is the keyboard and mouse. The keyboard is not backlit and is definitely not as nice to type on as the Macbook air. The trackpad was initially somewhat unresponsive, but when I called asus they suggested that i download new drivers from the asus website and voila the trackpad is working great now.EDIT: GT's review is accurate in that Asus shipped these with different components some better than others. I was lucky enough to get the ADATA SSD but had the Syntellic trackpad.I had to ship my laptop to asus a few times regarding trackpad, and eventually I simply asked them to replace the trackpad with the elantech pad and everything has been better since. The customer support was pretty good and the repair time was great. BUt it really should've have been shipped to me in the condition it is in now. 1 year later -- this is a better product today than it was when I bought it.","October 15, 2011",1
laptops,"Nice look, but some bugs to work out",Ugruk,RUMI5C6GURS70,3,"I bought the Zenbook about 8 months ago, and thought I'd hold off on doing a review until I'd had a chance to fully get the feel of it. In retrospect, I wish I had gotten a more conventional laptop. I absolutely love the look and feel of the Zenbook, but switch to my old Asus netbook, desktop, or my wife's Toshiba if I want to get some work done. When I use the Zenbook to work on a MS WORD doc, I am constantly re-setting the cursor, which frequently jumps to other places in the document. This happens with or without an external mouse - and when I am careful to touch only the keys. I have also noticed that the battery life isn't what I expected. If you want a nice looking computer to impress your friends in the coffee shop, and plan to use it only for checking e-mail or surfing the web, this one's for you. If you plan to use it for serious work, you might want to consider something else.","January 20, 2013",1
laptops,Good First Try,Chris Macias,R16QL4MBQRM04A,3,"Pros:Battery Life- this outshines my Sony machine. With the sony I can last about 2.5-3 hours. on this machine I can get over eight hours, a huge plus!Cloud- it is very nice to have work synced up with my main Sony machine. This is of course if you are comfortable using Google's web applications. I would make sure not to utilize the cloud for any sensitive information.Boot-Up- almost instantaneous! Definitely nice to not have to wait on a desktop to load upCons:Keyboard layout- Some minor quips about button placement. The top row of function keys have been replaced with web-centric keys, I never use them! I having been using Alt + Arrow keys to navigate and Ctrl + R to reload on my Sony I still do this. There is no delete button, instead the power button takes up the position where the delete key resides on my Sony. I have to consciously adjust my typing since all i have to work with is a backspace button. The Caps Lock key has been replaced by a dedicated search key, I hardly used the Caps Lock key, so I have tendency to not use the search key as much as the designers had intended. Other notable missing keys that I had used often are: home, end, page up, and page down.Mousepad- I have been using both a Sony Laptop and Macbook Pro, both with multi-touch functionality. It is disappointing to to not see similar execution built into the over-sized touch pad. Right clicking is a little awkward using two fingers to get the right click menu. However, Drag and Drop is made painful by placing one finger down and using the other to drag the item around the screen, while keeping the other one still in its place. Not very well executed, and can be uncomfortable.Data- 100MB for one month! Ridiculous with the amount of content on a single page, I would be surprised if you didn't hit the ceiling by the end of one week let alone a couple days. I checked my facebook page, logged into gmail, and updated my tweetdeck app, in a matter of 15-20 minutes i had used up 12MB of the 100MB allowance. The pricing on the data options are very unreasonable. 5G of data for one month will set you back fifty dollars! Of course this is the same treatment that smartphone users have to endure, an unfortunate consequence of an oligopoly .Google Music Beta- having been an early adopter of the chromebook, I would have thought that Google Music would be pre-installed or at least a definite invite.Removable Media- I tried plugging in my Western Digital 1 TB external to test out the file manager, that I had read about. After about 3 minutes of waiting, I gave up and unplugged the device. It was taking way to long to try to read the files.Lack of Apps- The Chrome Market has many apps, but very few great apps, while this is most likely due to the infancy of this platform, I find the lack of options a little diappointing.Notes: The computer was designed with the sole purpose of consuming content on the Internet. It does not disappoint in this arena. However, I can not recommend the device as a laptop replacement, or content generator. It is very convenient for traveling, being light weight and able to connect to either 3G or nearby wireless networks with ease. I would say this would be a suitable substitute for smart phone web browsing allowing you to save battery life on your precious iOS or Android device. I am satisfied with my purchase, and believe it is a good first attempt.","June 24, 2011",1

laptops,great toy or writing,justme,R1H1KIKAMWIBY1,3,"Wonderful quick little toy. Can be serious for some light coding, or if you are a blogger or writer - fantastic device.Light, quick, actually has a battery life.You can quickly get used to everything being ""web app"" and not having a ""file system""...However I know that at some point a few things will be an issue1) as downloads become plentiful, managing them and finding will be problem2) being limited to a tab interface becomes almost tiresome. Multitasking isn't as intuitive... but that could be a plus because you can just focus on getting one task done. The tab becomes cumbersome because page titles aren't always the most helpful so once you have 20 tabs open... and multiple windows, you need a road map.Biggest complaintThe finger pad. Some really cool possibilities like two fingers scroll the page up and down. Nice touch.. however the finger pad is rigid and follows different standards. Clicking and dragging isn't as simple as my other laptops or a mouse.The fingerpad doesn't seem responsive BUT nor does the computer overall. You need to remind yourself your on web pages.It would be nice if the ""apps"" could indeed run outside of a tab window. So they can feel more like apps instead of windows.Interesting thought, we've been making computers feel more like browsers and now that there is one that does that, you realize it would be nicer if I can minimize, scroll and have little modal windows/apps running instead of running them in just a main chrome browser window.Another drawback is you go app/sign in crazy. Suddenly, to many apps, to many logins and you get lost.I also found interesting that my 7 and 8 year olds as most kids are, just pick up a device and use it. Kindle fire, droid phones, motorola tablets - we have them all in the house.. kids never even ask me to do something or how can I. They find apps, install them, play them or remove them.I was excited to let the boys try the Samsunc Chrome book and some of the games on there.. they both walked away after 15 minutes use. I plugged in a little usb mouse ( which they HATE using the mouse ) and it improved it a little... but I was really excited to try some games like google Input/Output but my one that loves games like that got frustrated after a few hang ups, the game not working, sluggish response and refreshing the page.HOWEVER POSITIIVESI want it for me... I can do with out the games but found same frustrations above.. and I am a power user, and a web developer... so not a novice.But in the Chrome defense, I wanted to connect to a webpage, make some html changes and move on. I quickly found a great app. Completed tasks and moved on.I am an avid writer working on several projects which I store in google docs.FANTASTIC. And for it's compact design, the keyboard is nicely spaced. I was typing at normal speeds within minutes.DESIGN OF PRODUCT - externalslim, sleek, proud to carry it, nice and simple. No frills.Feels a little cheap in a way but its aesthetic is nice.. and the ""cheap"" isn't so bad.. first - it is. Price point is fantastic.. and it boots up as promised.. so I know the weight of it is intentional. It almost doesn't even feel like there is a battery in it.I would buy another, probably a nicer model to see if it boasts anything more. Would be great for homework and kids, not so much for gaming.And I hope the app designers start adopting wider standards for logins and such. Some apps were just annoying to login.. and I don't want to share every game I play on facebook so don't force me to.Great for new product, has a lot of work.. for the dollar amount, it would be tough to be dissapointed.","April 6, 2012",1
laptops,"Good, but not great","J. Orate ""Viper""",R4HOMS6E3UTX0,3,"My first Chromebook was received DOA, so my first impression wasn't very good at all. After submitting it back for an exchange, I waited about a month to receive another one. Again, not a very good impression and I hadn't even worked on it yet.Once I did receive a working model, I began using it for what it was intended. Basically a netbook without the bells and whistles.The weight is heavy, although the battery life is outstanding. If all you do is surf the web, check e-mail, and social network, then this is ideal. Productivity type activities is done via Google apps (docs, g-mail, etc...). Good for people who haven't used Microsoft Office before, but hard for people that need to transition for a feature rich set of tools.Overall, I think this is a good start with the new technology, but still needs some maturing to do before it's ready for prime time use.","August 6, 2011",1

laptops,generally happy with it (except for serious wi-fi problem),"Ricky Blue ""I must be the worst grad student ...",R1RPIFXMFJIN5R,3,"A couple of years ago I bought a Lenovo because I needed a Windows device to run statistics for a lab I was working in for school. Initially I hated it because it was I had always been an Apple user way back to the days of the Apple IIe. I eventually got used to it, but I was still happy to have an excuse for getting a lighter laptop. Returning to Apple, I can see that there are things I prefer about both platforms. I really can't wait for Chromebooks to get more established, because I imagine I'll ultimately prefer those to Windows or MAC so there's that.As for this device, I mostly love it. The screen goes dark for no reason once in a while, which makes me wonder if I should return it or see if the Apple store will do anything about it even though I got Squaretrade instead of Applecare. The device itself is very nice. I can't really think of much I'd criticize about. In particular, the trackpad is good as Apple's trackpads always are. I just find Apple to be very controlling and sometimes I get annoyed because there are so many limits to customization. Also, I got some cheap plastic cover for it, and it looks amazing. It makes me smile when I use it, just because it's so pretty.I wonder if I spent too much money on this, but I spent just as much money on that stupid Lenovo, which continues to give me headache after headache...EDIT: The one thing I've noticed though is that it's constantly dropping the wi-fi and not wanting to reconnect to the same signal. It's so stupid because even the stupid Lenovo I have has no problem with these wi-fi networks. And it's not just certain networks it's almost every network. It's a constant problem to the point where I'm considering returning it or something.","November 2, 2013",1

laptops,Love/Hate,Mr. K,RFPIBL0MKPFZP,3,"I replaced an early 2008 Macbook with this base-model Macbook Air. The speed difference is astounding, and the battery life has me frequently forgetting my charger - and only realizing I forgot it when I see it laying on my desk when I get home. Getting used to the smaller hard drive is a work in progress. I think that is mostly because it's nice to have all my movies, music, and pictures available on a whim, but in reality, I rarely access my movies and pictures, so they have made their way onto an external drive until I set up iTunes Match.I have had some pretty significant issues, though.Firstly, I am unable to connect my 1st gen iPad via USB cable. While I don't expect to be able to charge from the MBA, the inability to even set up wireless sync with iTunes, which requires a USB connection to set up, makes this habitual backer-upper very nervous.Secondly, connecting the 2007 Apple bluetooth keyboard and the 2009 Magic Trackpad interferes with WiFi, causing low speeds and intermittent connections. These issues are experienced when one or both devices are connected, unless I am standing right next to the router. Even adding a repeater does not boost the signal enough to solve the issue. The suggestion thus far from Apple is to switch to a 5GHz router or to test all the channels on the 2.4GHz band. At this point, I am unable to practically use bluetooth devices with my brand new computer.I have been in contact with Apple Support, replaced the MBA, duplicated the issues on a fresh install (and after running software updates) and been back in touch with Apple support with the same issues. It is frustrating because everything works with my older Macbook under the same conditions. The issues are currently escalated and awaiting resolution.I am willing to settle for these issues for now with the hopes that they will be resolved soon by Apple with software updates.","August 22, 2013",1

laptops,"A powerful, compact and durable laptop, ruined by awful cooling",Derek Elam,R52J2EE9QLJGG,3,"I liked almost everything about this laptop when I owned it except two things: the price tag, and the cooling system. It's not upgradable either, but chances are if you're buying a Mac you won't be doing that anyway.The i7 processor on Apple's lightweight OS X is impressively fast for a laptop, and 8GB of RAM is more than enough for most uses. Mine had a 640GB hard drive and an optical drive that worked well enough.It's expensive, yes, but Macbooks are impressive systems even for this price. They're made from aluminum instead of plastic and are solidly built, and very compact. The i7 processor coupled with Nvidia's mobile graphics card is powerful enough to game on, BUT...the real deal-breaker for me with this Mac was its cooling. In favor of a sleek ""unibody"" design, Apple neglected to install proper cooling for the CPU or the graphics, with the only exhaust vent being behind the hinge of the laptop, and no intake vents anywhere. Fifteen minutes of Minecraft would easily get the CPU chip hot enough to boil water, and sometimes it would just crash. The lack of vents on the bottom makes chill mats/cooling pads a fruitless effort. The aluminum body absorbs some of the heat, but this is actually a bad thing, because it can easily get too hot to keep on your lap, and touching the bottom with bare skin could even cause minor burns.So I sold mine off. But if you aren't planning to game or do anything else that demanding of your laptop, it's a great system. I'm just stumped as to why anyone would pay 2000 bucks if they weren't going to use it for something like this.","January 20, 2014",1

Kinda Gentle....If you are going to drop a big dime.....Think carefully. Another of my issues was that I wanted to transfer my DOS stuff from XP...Pics, music and soforth...wasn't sure about about Mac....Those tiny buttons tho were the deal killer.Good luck in your search....I have Kumbyaaa in my house....:)Good luckMark","October 15, 2013",1
laptops,"Great Computer, as always....",buysALot,R2BBPBYHOL8VR4,3,"my review is to commend apple on another amazing product. 3 stars is because of the horrible way amazon sent me my delivery. My first attempt at posting this was rejected by amazon, hopefully this one makes it.

laptops,"I like the MacBook Pro, not the amazon service...",Ashley,R3QXPWJBJP8MJG,3,"I switched from Windows to Mac when purchasing this laptop. I was extremely happy with the OS itself. It does not take as long to learn as I expected. After a few hours of usage however, I was having issues with it. The fan was at 6000rpm and the CPU usage was high. I am an Info Sys major in college, so I started researching this issue on my own. I found a solution but I was lacking files required to do it, so I gave in and called Apple. I told them that I just received my brand new MacBook but I was having issues. He looked up the serial number and told me it isn't new; that someone had registered my MacBook with Apple Care 50 days ago.When I ordered this, there was no mention that I was ordering a used/refurbished product. I refuse to buy used technology. Hopefully my replacement is brand new. I will be calling Apple as soon as I get it so they can check the serial number.**I definitely recommend a MacBook, just not sure if I would recommend buying one from Amazon. Try going straight to the source. Its probably worth the extra money to ensure it is a new product.","October 13, 2013",1
laptops,Switching from Windows 7 to OS X,R. Kavuri,R1KWV88UFXTQ4N,3,"I have already posted a similar review for the MBP old version, I am posting the same review here again since my review concentrates on the user interface of OS X. (not too sure whether I am allowed to do post the same review but just thought it could help some people before they switch to OS X)I have been a Windows user since I started using a computer and I never used a Mac OS X till I actually bought the MBP in 2011. So, this review would really help someone who is considering a Mac for the first time and wants to use it either at school or to remotely connect to work. This article summarizes what you would love and what you could be missing.I previously owned a desktop, a HP laptop and a Compaq laptop before I bought a MBP. Also, I still use Windows machine at work. One of the major reasons I bought the MBP was because it was available on a eBay deal from Macmall for $950. I assumed that if I did not like it, I could always sell it for at least $850 on eBay or Craigslist.Before reading the next part, please do understand that MBP and OS X come together. Things you need to know --**OS XSwitching between applications - This is one of my biggest quirks with OS X. Windows 7 does an awesome job in switching between applications. When you want to switch between the applications, you use ALT+TAB in Windows 7 and this would shift the focus to the next application. If the application is minimized in OS X, you can switch between applications by using CMD+TAB but it does not automatically bring up the other application, it just changes the active application in menu bar. I never understood the reasoning behind this, why would I just want to see the menu bar of the other application, I cannot imagine doing anything just with a menu bar.After some search on the internet I found the work around to do this in OS X. The answer is to press CMD+TAB followed by the option key (just before releasing the CMD key) to switch between the applications perfectly. You can also scroll your four fingers on the track pad to bring up all the applications and then highlight the application you want to choose to change the active application window. It is simply irritating to switch between keyboard and the track pad when you are typing some document or email. You can also use function key F11 instead of swiping the four fingers on the trackpad but at the end of the day Windows 7 does a great job here.Please do note that you can only switch directly between applications but not directly to the active window of an application when you use CMD+TAB, for example you cannot switch directly to a open second excel workbook, you have to bring up the excel application first and only then can you switch to the second excel workbook. I am aware that there is software available (namely Witch for $14) to do this but I already paid for the machine and why should I go through all this trouble and change the system registry entries to simply switch between applications.We can also use spaces and assign some shortcuts to spaces(like option+arrow) to make the switch between applications easier but you need to assign a different space to every application and this could be tedious after some time. Also the animations could make you dizzy after a while (not too sure whether everyone would share the same opinion) and there is no way you can turn off these animations AFAIK.Switching within an application - To switch between the various windows of the same application, the answer is to press CMD+~, it works but what if I have 3 open excel workbooks. Same answer as above, scroll the four fingers or press the function key F11 to see all active windows.Taskbar could be a big deal - It is irritating not to have a task bar in OS X. You can never actually know that you had two open excel workbooks or two separate browser windows at a glance. To put this into context, try working in Windows 7 grouping all your applications together all the time, in Windows 7 the users have the option to ungroup individual windows by selecting ""Combine only when taskbar is full"" in the taskbar properties. The problem with this approach in OS X is that you will never know all the application windows unless you display all the active windows or highlight the application in the docking bar.Also, the docking bar still occupies a substantial amount of screen space even in its minimal size , in Windows 7 the taskbar is comparively small. Due to the screen size and resolution constraints we usually tend to hide this docking bar on the 13"" MBP so that we can see the applications in the maximum available screen space. So either compromise on seeing the active applications in docking bar or full screen mode for applications.Again, the app Witch is the answer for taskbar but it will display these active windows only when we press CMD+TAB.Full Screen - I am addicted to seeing everything in maximized window mode in Windows 7 machines, I could never be satisfied with the default resized small windows, so I installed a free application RightZoom to address this issue. So far, so good.Quick Links - The docking bar essentially acts likes the quick link shortcuts in Windows 7. CMD+W closes the application and CMD+Q quits the application, you have to be careful enough not to press Q instead of W. Please note that closing a window does not automatically quit an application, the application is still active and consumes CPU resources.VPN Connection - Certain (or many?) VPN connection softwares like Juniper cannot be installed on OS X because some of these VPN connections connect using some plugins that are designed specifically for Internet Explorer, which is not available on OS X. I wanted to connect to work using the Microsoft Office remote desktop client but could not do it due to this restriction .External Applications - All the applications cannot be installed in OS X. There are lots of companies out there that make products just for Windows machines. I had to install StatTools for my course work and the tool was not available for OS X, so I had to work from another Windows machine at work on the weekends for my course work. I could have also installed Bootcamp and that comes up next.Bootcamp - I installed Windows 7 using bootcamp on MBP. I observed that Windows 7 is slow and the hard disk makes squeaky noises when you are trying to open an application in bootcamp, also the track pad experience is not the same despite the various drivers and the keyboard layout is obviously different. You can overcome these problems by connecting the MBP to a HDTV or any monitor and then using a wireless Windows keyboard + mouse but then the whole setup is too much hassle and defeats the purpose of a laptop.Microsoft Office - The experience of using Microsoft Office on OS X is pretty subpar in comparison to Windows 7, may be it the fault of Microsoft but it is simply pretty hard for someone to transition from Office 2010 in Windows 7 to Office 2011 in OS X. For example, I am used to zooming in and out of Microsoft Word using shortcuts like Ctrl+Scroll Up (on trackpad) and Ctrl+Scroll Down but this option is not available as shortcut in the OS X version of Office. I wanted to type a formula for a cell in Excel and cannot find the formula bar. May be someone can help me if they know a way around enhancing this experience.Delete button - There is no substitute to Shift+Delete in OS X(CMD+del). Deletion followed by emptying trash is the only way to do it, if you are someone who is addicted to deleting the file at once there is no shortcut. CMD+SHIFT+DELETE is a shortcut to empty trash after you delete something (so two steps, not a major gripe).Cut + Paste - There is no such option as 'Cut+Paste' in OS X. If you want to move something to a different folder, you have to copy and paste the file into the target folder and then delete the original from the source folder. Or select the file and carefully drag the file from the source into the target folder.Preview - Preview can be used to view PDF files and image files. Preview can also be used to make some markings in a PDF file, that is pretty cool. But what if I want to see all the pictures in a folder at once using preview, the only option is to select all the images and then right click to open with preview to see the files (In certain situations we can select all images and press space bar and the photos come in a stream slideshow. Also, every time you open a PDF or an image file the preview application becomes active, I would have preferred the application to quit automatically when I close the image). In summary, it is easier and cooler in Windows 7 to view images.Software Installation - There is no control panel in OS X. Just drag the application into the trash bin and it is gone. It has traces in your system but essentially it is gone for all practical purposes. I like this easy deletion aspect in OS X.Wakeup time - The MBP is pretty fast on this aspectMountain Lion - Mountain Lion will provide you the option to wirelessely stream the content from your MBP to HDTV if you own a Apple TV (I do not know the other improvements, this stood out for me), something similar to the WiDi on the Windows laptops. Thats a really cool option, you do not need to have any HDMI cables at all to stream content.**HARDWARETrack pad - This is something you would love to use and a big selling point, you can never think of going back to other laptops after using this. I always used a mouse on the Windows laptops but never even felt the need for a mouse on the MBP. The two finger swipe to scroll and three finger swipe that replace the 'Home' and 'End' buttons, pinch and zoom for PDF document and images are pretty cool options. I was pretty amazed at the track pad when I started learning more about the OS X.Keyboard - Keys are located spaciously. My previous two laptops frequently had dirt stuck in between the keys which used to drive me crazy.Heat - HP and Compaq laptops generate so much heat that you can use them as a personal heater (I used to do it). The whirring sound made by my Compaq laptop's heat fan used to be pretty embarrassing for me in my class or in the meetings, I hated opening the laptop. In a contrast, the MBP is very calm, the fan does go up occasionally when you run some intensive applications such as office (along with some other intensive applications) or play graphic video games but you will hardly notice it.Build - Unibody aluminum build with just 10 screws at the back is something you would appreciate only when you have used other laptops made of plastic material that make creaky sounds every time you lift them. The upper lid of these other plastic material laptops tend to wobble a lot over time but the MBP's lid is pretty stiff even after 7 months of daily use (at least 3 hours a day).Screen - I personally like the fact there is no slight gap between the glossy screen and border of the lid. In other laptops dust gets stuck between the screen and the plastic and it could be really irritating when you cannot remove the dust. Screen quality, there are different manufacturers for the LCD screen, please search for 9CC3, 9CC5 and 9CC7 to know more about this. I have a 9CC3 (luckily) and it is supposed to be the best one available for a 13"" MBP.Ports - HDMI port is not available directly but you can buy a 10 feet long HDMI output cable for less than $20.DVD Drive - Other laptops tend to have DVD drive as an attachment but in a MBP it is inseparable (at least by the looks of it). The DVD drives on the two other laptops I owned before MBP used to make a quirky sound when I used to wake them up from sleep or do a restart, no such sounds on the MBP.Battery - The longest battery life out I could extract from MBP was about 6 hours with browsing. That is pretty good considering that other cheaper laptops can only last for 2.5 hours. Of course you can upgrade your battery on the other laptops but you need to compromise on the weight.Power Chord and Charger - One of my friends accidentally tripped over a $1000 Sony Vaio's power chord and the machine fell on the floor with brute force. I still remember how anxious he was till the machine powered up. This would not happen with a MBP, the chord attaches to the MBP with magnet, in case of an accident the power chord would detach itself and nothing would still happen to the MBP. The adapter is light weight and you can carry it in a backpack (no big bundles like the ones you see for HP and Dell).Function Keys - I use the function keys in Windows 7 machines to close application, essentially which means that I am going to just use F4 for pressing Ctrl+F4 or Alt+F4. I like the Apple's way of function keys, pretty easy to use and only contains what we exactly need. Ctrl+F4 and Alt+F4 are replaced by CMD+W in OS X.Webcam - 720p & perfect for Skype.Backlit Keyboard - If you have not used one without a backlit keyboard before you will love this option.Resale Value - Based on the eBay listings I can say that you could expect to recover 75% of the actual value of a MBP if you maintain it well (if sold within a year of purchase).Apple Warranty - International warranty for 1 year + easy replacement within 3 months + Apple protection for 3 years for $200 (warranty is international again) is really worth it. I felt that my battery was losing its power quickly and Apple Store promptly replaced the battery for me.Cons (the only one)Speakers Sound - Sound is kind of low for me, I really wish that it was louder.So to summarize I am impressed with the hardware by every bit and I really do not have any complaints about the hardware design.******************************************************************************In conclusion, if you are going to use your laptop for Microsoft Office and want to connect to Windows machine through Remote Desktop or VPN, I would recommend not to jump the ship to OS X and instead consider other alternatives listed below. The experience of Microsoft Office, switching between applications and productivity is much better on Windows 7.I would still recommend a MBP if you want to buy a laptop for casual browsing and simple applications at home, the hardware design is pretty awesome and Apple support is trustworthy.Alternatives to consider - Similar hardware design with Windows 7 would be a very good combination and that brings me to Windows Ultrabooks. Ultrabooks are about the same price (or in some cases cheaper than MBP), faster with a SSD and are very appealing with Windows 8 soon on the cards. I read on tech websites that HP Envy Spectre 14, Lenovo U300S, Asus Zenbook, HP Folio 13, Dell XPS and Samsung Series 9 are pretty well built like a MBP but run on Windows 7. Samsung Series 9 looks pretty good and has a 15"" option as well, so thats some good news if you are a Windows fan.","July 6, 2012",1

I am still transitioning from being a PC user to a mac user and I like the gestures feature on the trackpad. What I am not satisfied with is that Amazon did not have competitive price for this Macbook. I have always trusted Amazon for the lowest price, so much so that I stopped comparing prices around. However, 3 days after purchasing this Macbook Pro, I found the exact same macbook in Frys for more than $100 less! It taught me to compare prices before purchasing anything from Amazon in future!","October 23, 2012",1
laptops,Excelent but not perfect,"Felipe ""Felipe""",R1DRTQVL15OMSS,3,"For me this laptop was an important upgrade from my relatively old 13"" MacBook Air.It is much faster and the screen is almost perfect for photograph edition.The illuminated keyboard is an important feature for me specially when I use it on dark environments.The only bad thing is the MagSafe power connector. It was a big surprise for me see how easily can be disconnected so I have to reconnect very very often. It seems that the magnet is not strong and the cord not flexible enough to avoid accidental disconnection's.. Apple did not do a good job here. The old magnet connector was excellent this new one is a nightmare. Apple would replace it because it's an obvious design mistake.Update 8?24: I have solved the Magsafe 2 problem applying some glue between the connector and the cable and fix the cable in 90 degree with the connector. This minimize the lever effect when the cable is pulled up or down as it is in the Magsafe 1. Apple should change it in this way.","August 21, 2012",1

It bothered me but I thought just a small inconsistency, immediately three days after keys came off immediately with no effort. The compartment for the cd-rom seemed a bit unsteady.Very alarming, but a relative said it was obviously defective send back to Amazon and they will correct it. He purchased his Asus from them about three years ago and it is working perfectly. I occasionally jump on to use for quick research. Ironically I jumped on his to purchase mine in the first place.The great part of this experience is Amazon was very helpful. They immediately arranged for a return to their facility and help calm my being so disappointed. I hope to have my perfect laptop in time for research. Considered getting another brand or color, but I really loved the white. Very nice size and seemed good except for the external. But next time on the new one I want insurance (sorry guys)Amazon's immediate reaction is the only reason their getting a good score.","August 1, 2012",1

laptops,"Excellent power, annoying audio bug.",Greg Siegel,R11G1QA3D1S7MS,3,"Everything you've read in the other reviews about its power is true. Portal 2, Skyrim, etc. all look beautiful on this laptop. The matte screen with full 1080p resolution is very nice and easy on the eye. The jet engine fans on the back of the laptop have allowed for hours of gaming without feeling like I could flip the laptop over and grill an egg.Now, some issues. One is that the space bar is not as responsive as I would like on a gaming keyboard. If I have my thumb too far over to one side, it will fail to register the press. This being the jump key in a lot of games, one can imagine the annoyance this has caused (I've run straight off of platforms like a dork).The major issue, however, is that the subwoofer will sometimes play when you have headphones in. For a while, every time I started a media source that had audio, I would have to pull out my headphones and reinsert. This is quite annoying when you are trying to play something in a crowded room, or when someone in your house is sleeping. I uninstalled the drivers and let windows install its own, but now it mutes the audio until I click mute then unmute again. I don't know what is going on with this audio chipset, but there appear to be some kinks to iron out.The audio issue is not a dealbreaker for me, as the laptop really is quite nice looking with excellent performance.I am hoping an update in the future will make my $1300 purchase perform as it should.","August 28, 2012",1

laptops,Great if you're not a fan of the letter D,Sampson Simpson,R2L17X3136YZXR,3,"This computer is gorgeous. Absolutely gorgeous.I bought this Zenbook Prime to replace a 2011 11"" Macbook Air which, after a bit of water damage, was going to cost $750 to repair. For that same amount I was able to buy this fella used through Amazon Warehouse. It was a no-brainer and I still have no regrets, though I primarily used Windows 8 on the MBA as I find it to be preferable to OSX.I would like to first emphasize how amazing Amazon Warehouse Deals are. This computer came completely refurbished--the only difference between the refurbished Apple products I've bought and this one was the amount of accessories that came with this thing. For the price paid it was absolutely excellent, especially considering it was actually cheaper than the UX31 sporting an i5. It was like new, with no scratches or anything, and it very clearly had a roto-rooter refurb job done on it for much cheaper than the models listed as refurbished.This computer is physically gorgeous. The screen on this thing is life-changing. It is, in my opinion, a prettier package than the Macbook Air--while the Apple aluminum look is now dated, this brushed aluminum look is a head-turner. While the new Haswell chips are excellent for battery life, Apple's failure to incorporate a full HD screen makes the MBA not even worth considering when compared to the UX31. It comes with what would have been $100 worth of accessories--cases, adapters, etc. The backlit keyboard is a nice touch, and the keyboard itself is stately and aesthetically pleasing.Performance is good. While the integrated graphics aren't powerful enough to handle full HD gaming, by lowering the settings slightly Super Meat Boy was playable, and the screen made playing (wandering around?) Fez a great experience. I'm not a real gamer but it has thus far suited my needs. The computer can handle any multimedia one throws at it, and Photoshop runs so easily on this computer I fear it would get bored if it were sentient. I'd highly recommend upgrading to Windows 8 as the vivid colors of the OS really pop. The screen isn't as great as the Chromebook Pixel, and I haven't compared it to the Retna, but for $750 used it's impressive enough to make me forgo watching things on my HDTV. I haven't experienced the leaks around the edges of the screen others have mentioned--the exterior construction is flawless and gorgeous.There is, however, one fatal flaw with the quality control--there is none. I nearly returned this computer, and certainly would have if it weren't for my roommate's torx wrench and a little technical proficiency. There are many reoccurring issues into which buyers of these computers have run (both used and new, leading me to blame Asus rather than Amazon), ranging from light leaks on the outer parts of the screen and the one with which I had an issue--the keyboard just isn't connected strong enough and random keys stopped working (D, delete, and the direction pad) consistently but intermittently. This issue was so common I was able to Google the issue and find out how to fix it. I had to pop open the back of the computer (something I'd assume most would agree shouldn't be necessary with a brand new computer, and something with which many wouldn't be comfortable), take off the MASKING TAPE WHICH HELD TOGETHER THE KEYBOARD CONNECTOR and reconnect it. Since I've done this I have absolutely zero complaints about the computer, but for a computer that typically retails for over $1000 this seems a bit egregious. I know if virtually any of my relatives had purchased this computer it would be considered ""broken.""It is really tough to recommend this laptop to anyone without a bit of technical proficiency due to these sort of quality control issues. I nearly returned it, knowing I can't trust the innards to not fall apart when a piece of tape dries. If you're going to buy this laptop, the most must-have accessory is a torx wrench. If I had the option for half stars it'd have been 3.5, but I can't suggest it's nearly perfect. Now that 1080p is becoming the industry standard for screens, and everyone's producing ultrabooks, it's likely worth looking at some of the competition. I wouldn't discourage you from buying this laptop if you're confident you can handle some minor internal maintenance but that really shouldn't be necessary. [Consider this review to be four stars if you're the type who doesn't get anxiety when opening the back of a laptop.] If Asus spent as much time on quality control as it did on the excellent screen and gorgeous aesthetics this would've been five stars.","July 2, 2013",1
laptops,I wanted to love it...UPDATED,Maryrose Larkin,R2M0EPDXQOIPK6,3,"Update: February 10, 2013...I worked with the customer service specialist below and I have had my computer repaired. I didn't have to use my other warranty. I'm still not wholly happy that the computer had so many things wrong with it, but I was glad that they replaced everything. I WILL KEEP UPDATING. II purchased this computer in October 2012 and I've been disappointed with the constant small problems this machine has had out of the box.I assumed when buying a premium laptop, that I would receive a premium product, but I've been very disappointed.I primarily bought the Asus Zenbook because I'm disabled and self employed and I needed a very light but fast laptop.I'm not a programmer, but I run an internet consulting and research business, and I am entirely dependent on the computer for my income.I've been primarily a dell latitude user for the past 10 years, but wanted to treat myself to something that was more state of the art. I was attracted to the ASUS Zenbook as an apple alternative. This is the most expensive computer I've purchased and I had very high hopes for it.The good1) This is a beautiful machine and I loved unboxing it. People compliment me on its beauty all the time.2) I love the responsiveness of the solid state drive. I'm never going back to a traditional hard drive again. The programs and the operating speed is fast fast fast.3) the keyboard is a good size and is easy to type on.4) The computer is really lightweight!5) The audio is pretty good for a laptop.The bad1) The screen is beautiful but very fragile. I've had two six inch white marks spontaneously appear on the screen and I've only owned the computer since October2) From the start I've have a really difficult time with the virtual wi-fi miniport. Although the system usually hooks up to my wifi when the machine is booted up, after putting it in sleep mode I've needed to continually troubleshoot my wifi to get it to reconnect. The troubleshooter has given me various solutions including reloading the wifi card (which is internal). I've used ASUS's online technical suppor which suggested I download new drivers, which I did with no improvement.3) The last straw is that tonight, after less than 3 months of use, the ac adapter has started to misbehave in that way where you need to jiggle to adapter input and pull the wires to get the adapter to recharge the battery, so you have to push and pull at the adapter and it continually stops recharging, and you have to jiggle and jiggle it. I've had this problem with Dells before, and it could be the adapter or it could be a bad soldering job and unlike the other problems, I can't work around this one and still use the machine.I went through a lot of things with the Dell Latitudes, but not in the first three months! I'm really disappointed because I've heard many good things about ASUS and this machine has been a disappointment.I'm currently trying to figure out whether I should deal with ASUS or deal with Square Deal (where I also purchased a warranty) to have these problems fixed.I've tried to contact ASUS by email about my original wifi problem and the person tried to be helpful, but didn't acknowledge that I had already reinstalled the drivers etc. I'd rather go through ASUS so I don't invalidate my Square Deal Warranty, but although they offer accident protection, You need to sign up in several different places, and I'm concerned that I might have missed the deadline by a few days on the accident protection (I'm assuming the screen issue will be considered an ""accident"" even though I have no idea how it got there.Anyway, if you need a laptop for business purposes, you probably want to buy something more reliable, and where you sign up in just ONE place for services vs. multiple place.Maybe I just got a lemon, but I'm sad I'll need to go through the hassle of backing up, boxing up and returning a new computer for a handful of manufacturing or design issues. I'm especially unhappy because it is a premium machine. My dell latitude just keeps plugging along, and I guess i'm going to go back to that while this gets fixed.","January 1, 2013",1
laptops,Great except for the backlight bleed!,Tom,RRHHDDFBPPY9E,3,"The design is great, sleek and light. The screen looks amazing with such a pixel density but the bleeding along the bottom is killing me. I work in the terminal on linux with a black background. This makes the backlight bleed a nuisance and for the price is unacceptable. I am considering exchanging it and if that does not work I will return it and purchase the Lenovo X1 Carbon that comes out next month.I really don't want to have to RMA it as I need a laptop for work and soon school. Especially without a guarantee that it is fixed.","July 30, 2012",1

laptops,Beauty is skin deep,Ziad Krayem,R343C88G3ZGBFF,3,"I do purchase lots of laptops each year, as I have a nag for trying new tech.But I like to think that I am in constant search for the perfect gadget and never finding it (be it a laptop, a tablet, a phone, a remote control...)And let me tell you, I have never been torn by a product as much as I did with Vizio CT15-A1The laptop is gorgeous, the screen is amazing, and the build quality is superb. But there are some serious short comings.I had the laptop for nearly a month now, and I stil feel this love and hate realtionship. I can't make up mind wether to keep it or ditch it for another laptop. (either way, in few months, a new laptop must fill its shoes, especially with Win8 on the way)What I love about the laptop:* Looks space-age. And I don't mean like a Macbook Air does (althoug the similarities are stunning), it is the angular design of the screen lid, and above all, the grayish hue on the body.* Excellent construction, with very useful rubber bottom.* Amazing IPS full-HD matte display* Cool charger ligths (abit too bright)What I hate about the laptop:* The touchpad* The touchpad* The touchpad (yes, that much!) of all the laptops I ever used, no touchpad ever came close to the horride experience of this laptop; gestures are erratic, touch sensitivity is horrible, and above all, the touchpad always ignore any minute gesture: to stick the pointer over something small, you must first swipe hard to get the cursor moving and then quickly set the cursor where you want... an exercise in patience.* Short battery life: while doing nothing but surfing the web, I get about 4 hours.* Keyboard is not likeable, but in reality is not as bad as other users have described. and of course, it is not backlit. It would not register some keys if very lightly pressed.* Should not really be called an ultrabook, because it does not standby as other laptops do: if you simply close the lid, the laptop goes on standby, not the deep sleep mode. So in few hours, battery would have dropped by about 20%, and then it goes into hibernate. So, first you are faced with unexpeted reduction in battery, second, you have to wait for the laptop to resume from hibernation, which BTW takes longer than a full boot.* There is a 2GB hibernation partition, which is weird given the laptop has 4GB of memory, so I think it is useless and unused (which might be the cause for the behavior above)* Recovery partition is there, but there is no way to extract it on Media, and, you must boot windows in recovery mode to be able to access it. pretty useless if your main parition is corrupt (which is at times why you would like to do recovery in the first place). It is a weird decision to do this, and maybe it is justified by the fact that the hard drive is not meant to be user replacebale. Or maybe such decision reflects Vizio's inexperience in the PC business world.* Charger is standard size (which is to say big), which is a shame given how beatifully designed the laptop is, and since battery life sucks, leaving the charger behind is not something you would want to do.You can see how many shortcomings there are, and yet I cannot hate the laptop... that should be an indication how beautiful the laptop is :) Beauty is skin deep? yeah, but it got me!","October 8, 2012",1
laptops,All It Needs Are Accessories To Make It Usable,"R. Cross ""LVWolfman""",R1BGTRTVIY3NCA,3,"This was purchased from Amazon, but by my boss, not by me. He was so disgusted with it that rather than return it, he just gave it to me.Weight, looks and performance-wise, this is a good notebook! Slim, easy to carry and a beautiful screen.However it needs a few accessories to make it what is in my opinion, usable.1. A wireless mouse or touch pad as the provided touch pad is extremely unusable. Granted, I'm used to the one on Apple notebooks, but my wife's cheap HP notebook touch pad is much easier to use. I suggest going with a Bluetooth mouse or touch pad as there are only two USB ports on this computer.2. A wireless keyboard as the provided one looks great but the keys don't always work. I have to pay special attention when typing an 'f' or a 'c' for instance as it usually won't appear. Or you'll easily get double keystrokes. Combined with the native touch pad which I haven't been able to disable, when typing up a report, letter or even a Facebook post, I'll find that the cursor has suddenly jumped up a number of lines and I'm typing in the middle of something previously written. Again, I suggest a Bluetooth keyboard as there are only two USB ports. Though if you have a Logitech unifying receiver, you can use one port for both the keyboard and mouse/pad.3. An external hard drive. The 128GB SSD is fast. However, 100GB for applications and data really isn't very much. I've install the software that I need to use for work, (Adobe Creative Suite, Office 2013, etc.), my documents and very little else. I ended up with about 41GB free. I can't install Dropbox as our shared folder would fill the drive. So, tie up a USB port with an external USB hard drive. I picked up a 2TB Western Digital that uses USB3 at a decent price.4. A USB network adapter. The radio on this thing is WEAK. Our WiFi router is currently two walls and about 40 feet away. Every few minutes, I lose Internet access and have to reset the radio by pressing the F3 key to turn it off and then again to turn it back on. (That same key also disables Bluetooth for some strange reason.) My wife's HP sitting two feet closer has NO problems. If I move to within six feet of the router, I can keep a connection a lot longer but it still drops out from time to time. The latter also applies with my Verizon 4G LTE hotspot sitting 3 feet from the Vizio. Using a USB WiFi adaptor, I don't get any network dropout.So, if you're willing to spend more money, use the Bluetooth and both USB ports, this is a pretty snappy and beautiful notebook and very usable.On the other hand, I think that if it was MY money being spent, I'd have gone with the Acer at Costco. 8GB of ram vs 4GB, almost as thin but has a DVD burner and 3 USB3 ports and a touch screen perfect for Windows 8. It only uses a 750GB spinner hard drive so wouldn't be as snappy. The keyboard is backlit, has a numeric keyboard and types a LOT better. Even the touch pad is very usable. I only use the Acer as an example of how for a $100 more, one can get a much better thin notebook.Hopefully, Vizio has learned from their mistakes with their first notebook and has fixed them in the newer models.Pros: Thin, light, lovely and snappy performanceCons: Bad keyboard, bad touch pad, weak WiFi radio, limited storage, limited memory and poor expandability. (Remember, like the newest Apple notebooks, what you buy is what you get. Nothing in this is upgradable or expandable. No swapping the battery, putting in a bigger hard drive or more memory.)","March 24, 2013",1
laptops,"Worth the price, but not much more",Matt,R14GXU1542BASM,3,"Vizio's first attempt at a lightweight laptop is very promising but it just misses the mark.What I love:The big screen is just gorgeous. I love the matte finish, as in the sun, there's minimal glare. I've had MacBooks before and frankly this screen is up there with any of them. Cheap, great displays are kind of Vizio's game, so I'm not surprised they excelled here.The system comes as a Signature product, meaning the OS comes as Microsoft designed it. I really like this as it's faster, more efficient, etc.Speed and performance for the $ can't be beat.What I hate:The keyboard and touchpad are subpar quality. Made me really miss the Mac (and I'm not a Mac fan).The case can be hard to open. It's more annoying than anything else.Battery life is just not as good as other models at this price point. But you always have a tradeoff between weight, speed, AND battery life so I was more willing to sacrifice on this one.All in all, I'd probably have gone with another machine and paid a bit more, but for the price point, this is a pretty good value...","October 22, 2012",1
laptops,VIZIO Thin and Light CT15-A1 15.6-Inch Laptop,Reginald Carter,R1ENI1BDYD3L70,3,"This laptop is beautiful. Very zippy and thin. Easy to carry around and extremely easy to boot up. However, I do have some recommendations, the mouse-pad is TERRIBLE. The keyboard is below average for a laptop, keys to close together and hard to read. However, there are some work around, I bought keyboard stickers to make the keys more visible. Of course if you will need an external mouse, especially when you're using the laptop on desk. I guess the mouse pad wasn't built for long-term usage because after a short while it starts to stick. So if you're look for a zippy ultra thin laptop for relatively low price you should look at this one. However, if need a 100 percent functionally laptop you may like to look at others.","April 6, 2013",1

laptops,Awesome tablet but keyboard doesn't work,Neddie B,R12ENKNXSLKBOH,3,"The tablet is great! It is light, thin, nice looking, quiet, and the screen is incredible. The tablet itself exceeds all expectations I had when ordering this device. To clarify for some of the confused and misguided users, this device DOES come with the keyboard dock and DOES NOT have 3G/4G (A01US model).The big disappointment and the reason I only gave 3-stars is the keyboard dock is unusable. The physical connection seems solid and well engineered but the electronic connection between the keyboard and tablet is a complete failure. The keyboard is constantly connecting and disconnecting forcing windows to play the ever so annoying connection/disconnection chime. Typing is next to impossible because the keyboard is only connected to the device about half the time. I can be sitting perfectly still and just the slight movement caused by touching the screen or hitting keys forces the connection to fail. I've spent over 4-hours dealing with Samsung Executive support who has really tried to help but they seem unequipped to send me a new dock which we both decided would be the best first step in solving the problem in lieu of sending the unit in for repair (I bought this from Amazon thru Tiger Direct so an easy and QUICK exchange is not possible). Samsung is supposed to call me back with a solution (fingers crossed).The S-Pen is also great! Taking notes on this screen is better than using paper and twice as good as trying to use the S-Pen on the Note II due to the much larger screen.Bottom line is this would be a 5-star unit if the keyboard worked and if they shipped the first models with 3G/4G (the pain of being an early adopter).","November 21, 2012",1
laptops,"5 star tablet, 2 star keyboard",Isaac Einstein,R3L2AA6Z65PXPG,3,"Another early purchaser from a windows store here. I'm having the same problem as some are posting with the non-pro model, where the keyboard often thinks it is disconnecting and reconnecting from the tablet (windows8 makes the docking/undocking noise). Despite that, the keyboard mostly seems to keep working fine, so if I turn off the volume, it's mostly a non-issue. This maybe an overall poor engineering job, or perhaps there are just some defective units. Either way, on top of that issue, I think the keyboard is very low quality. The keyboard keys are ok to use(I normally type 60wpm and tested at 50wpm on it, not bad), but it is too light (too top heavy with a solidly built tablet sitting on a flimsy cheap feeling plastic keyboard) and not backlit. I also find that when used in my lap, the screen doesn't quite tilt back far enough for my tastes. The tablet itself is great - super fast, awesome stylus (tested with one-note, wow it's awesome!), superb screen & resolution, feels solidly built, etc. However I bought it for the 'convertible' aspect, so the top-heaviness and overall poor keyboard is really off-putting.For me, as a tablet this thing shines beautifully (minus the fingerprints smudges), but due to my perceived pitfalls as a ""laptop"", it just doesn't warrant the high price point. Maybe I'll try the non-pro and see if its fast enough for my needs. At that price I might forgive the keyboard, though I'm not sure I can accept a screen lower resolution after using this one. I'm going to return my first unit and hopefully the docking problem will be fixed on the second, and I'll give it another week or so to see if it grows on me, otherwise it's going back, and I'll wait to try the surface pro or maybe something else that comes out with a digital stylus. I think Samsung really missed the boat not making a quality keyboard for a quality device. I think just adding a battery to the keyboard would have balanced it out and as a bonus would have given it a better battery life (battery life seemed good, but realistically I can't comment on it as I don't feel I've had enough real world usage yet), plus some backlighting on the keyboard and this device would be top-notch. Maybe they'll come out with an optional keyboard later, but at this price I'd need it to come included.","November 16, 2012",1

laptops,6 month review,Christoph64,R35KMUFJZORPQQ,3,"It's nice to have a laptop that doesn't burn your lap. It's taken a little while to figure out Windows 8, but once you learn the secrets it's OK. I also like the smooth finger pad vs. those with the tiny holes. I initially rated this computer 4 stars but it was lowered to 3 stars because what you see on the screen when looking at a picture you're going to print is NOT what you get printed out. When I print pictures from this computer they are either very dark or oversaturated. The reason, I think, is because the colors on the laptop screen are not as vibrant as the actual colors on the photo. And so I was increasing the saturation and adjusting the colors, in Windows Photo-Gallery, to make the pictures look normal. This resulted in oversaturated and dark photo prints even though on the Gateway screen it looked fine. Most of the pictures I download from my camera onto this computer seem dull in color and needing the saturation increased. There is no way to increase the saturation of the screen, only the brightness. I have an older Dell desktop which accurately shows the colors of the downloaded photos and what the colors and brightness will be when you print them out. So I have to use the Dell and can't use this Gateway for photo editing and printing which is inconveniant. Otherwise this computer has worked fine. But next time I'll buy a laptop that will have a 'What you see is what you get' view of photos.","February 19, 2013",1
laptops,Very good buy for the price.,"Rose Mora ""Redflower""",RW92PVSJNYDY2,3,This is a good computer for the casual user. It has good memory and disk space. I bought it as a gift.,"January 10, 2013",1
laptops,"Good for casual user, better for advanced users. Great price.","M. McFall ""Yay interwebs""",R3K9EZV85E4CX9,3,"Overall, this is a decent to good Ultrabook, providing fantastic value at the price point the i3 version is being offered for ($500 at time of purchase). I'd rate it at 3.5 stars. It's a handsome looking notebook and I bought this to replace a tiny netbook my wife had been using; the price of this Ultrabook is only a couple hundred more than a difficult to use small, brand new netbook, while having good functionality (good luck typing on a fancy, more expensive tablet, or sub 11"" notebook), more processing grunt than tablets and most netbooks, all within a slim, relatively lightweight profile that is suitable for travel.There are a lot of pros and cons to this ultrabook, but some of are non issues to casual users, while others make this ultrabook better suited to advanced users (or advanced users who set it up for a casual user).OUT OF THE BOX:The quality and appearance is great. The aluminum body and top lid are very sleek looking. The darker brushed aluminum on the top does tend to discolor and pick up fingerprints with ease. It's not terribly heavy and while the base is very sturdily built, the screen lid feels a bit flimsy. The top lid appears to be a combination of flimsier plastic, with a very thin brushed aluminum overlay. Lightly pressing on parts of the lid causes the LCD screen to have fluctuations. Despite the notebook being light, you'll want to resist picking up the notebook by the lid/screen, as it may risk damaging the LCD.LCD QUALITY:The glossy screen is clear, but has very poor viewing angles. 1366 x 768 resolution is merely adequate. Minor backlight bleeding on right and left edges. Colors are bright, vibrant, with a lot of contrast, but actual gamut (range of natural colors it can reproduce) is only average. This isn't a graphics workstation replacement nor intended for photographers/graphic artists who will be using this notebook for producing color perfect prints, so it's mostly a non issue.TOUCHPAD:The large touchpad seems to have fairly high dpi sensitivity, which is a very good thing. Swiping and navigating with the touchpad is fairly smooth, although I did experience an occasional stutters. Two and Three finger multitouch work as advertised. There is an easy to understand short manual showing users how to take advantage of the touchpad features. One of the nicer ones is to swipe in from the right edge to bring up the Windows 8 ""Charms"" bar.KEYBOARD:I'm a big fan of island style keyboards and having a full numpad. Keyboard feels very good to use and will have no problems for users who need to do a lot of typing and numerical input with it.SPEAKERS:The speakers are pretty unique and are actually integrated into the laptop's battery and produce a fantastic range of sound for a laptop. Among the best I've heard. UPDATE: Apparently, they're in the laptop. The battery has a faux speaker cover looking applique.CPU+GRAPHICS:The i3 provides a nice balance between power consumption and speed. The i3 is not slow by any means and the Intel integrated graphics aren't either. While you won't be able to play the newest games on high settings on this, many games are completely playable at low-mid settings. 1080p videos play flawlessly (when output to a higher resolution screen). The Intel integrated graphics share graphics memory with the computer-- if you add another 4GB of RAM (~$25), you can, through the BIOS settings, increase total graphics memory allocation to 512MB. I was able to play Shogun 2: Total War on decent quality settings after a small memory upgrade. The graphics power is around that of the Nvidia GT 610M or GT 630M (with max 512mb memory allocation).HARD DRIVE:This ultrabook has an integrated 24GB mSATA SSD (short type) on the motherboard and a 500GB 5400 rpm secondary hard drive, where both operate in tandem as a hybrid HDD (via Intel IRST). This provides relatively quick boot up and loading of most programs, but the 5400rpm hard drive a big crutch and despite any marketing, these 5400rpm drives are always a crutch and I've had a bit of slowdown on this notebook solely due to the 5400rpm drive. I swapped it out for an SSD, but it was a lot of work, which I'll get into later. This Ultrabook operates much faster and more reliably with an SSD in place of the 5400rpm mechanical drive.INTEGRATED PERIPHERALS:A nice amount of ports, USB 2.0 and 3.0 work at advertised speeds, HDMI and VGA out is nice, although I do wish it had an eSATA port. The camera is not very good and produced a very grainy picture. It's a typical low end webcam. Bluetooth, which was included in my model, has adequate range. I am surprised that a DVD drive can fit in this form factor, squeezing one in might have resulted in some QC issues with mine-- the eject DVD button works strangely, requiring a abnormally hard button press to get the DVD tray to eject. The DVD drive motor is also incredibly loud. DC Power jack seems pretty reinforced and feels like it won't be the first thing to go, as opposed to some of the other laptops I've owned.BATTERY:I get close to 5 hours with regular use which is more than adequate, considering how slim the battery is. Not as high as other ultrabooks, but this ultrabook is also less expensive.BLOATWARE:Not too heavy on bloatware, as compared with other manufacturers. Only had about 6 unnecessary programs to remove, albeit some of the Asus apps may be useful for the casual user (as they can provide easy file swapping options for connecting smartphones, working with the webcam, and setting up power options).ADVANCED USERS/UPGRADES:RAM is pretty easy to add another 4 GB. I also do like that it is just one single panel to remove (2 screws) to access both the HDD and the extra RAM slot. If you want to remove both sticks, you will need to remove the entire bottom cover/enclosure (about 16 screws). The BIOS is very lacking in options, which is unusual for Asus. There are no options to remove the Asus boot logo, nor are there options to select which boot device to use. It doesn't appear that this ultrabook allows booting from a USB thumbdrive, as I tried several bootable thumbdrives when I was trying a clean install, each time met with failure. It does allow booting from DVD, but I would feel better knowing I could boot from USB in case of DVD drive failure. Additionally, regarding the BIOS, this uses Secure Boot and an SLIC BIOS, which for the layman, automatically loads licensing data and prevents ""unsigned"" bootable DVDs and thumbdrives from loading/booting. This is why the laptop has no Windows License sticker. This was a big issue for me as I tried doing a clean install of Windows 8 Pro, but the SLIC BIOS automatically kept loading up the manufacturer keys for Win 8 Standard OEM during install, preventing me from using my own Windows 8 license. I was ultimately able to do a clean install Win 8 Pro, but it required some very hacky methods and backwards logic that I'll detail in the comments.Replacing the slow 500GB HDD with an SSD and installing an OS on it is a little tricky due to the integrated onboard mSATA SSD. If you're doing a clean install you'll have to reinitialize the mSATA SSD to restore the Intel IRST functions (Fast Boot, Fast Resume, Instant On, etc). You can also liberate and get full use of the onboard 24GB mSATA SSD as a conventional drive, alongside your own drive by deleting the GPT partitions and creating new volumes...but I recommend making a backup of all factory partitions+data from the 24GB mSATA SSD so you can return the laptop to factory settings, if necessary. The 24GB mSATA SSD is removeable, but it uses a short card; the longer, larger capacity standard size mSATA SSD cards, while they will fit, have no screw standoff to secure it. I'll be adding a laptop screw standoff so I can swap the 24GB integrated mSATA SSD with a 128GB mSATA SSD. Or you can completely remove the mSATA SSD and just have a single drive notebook. The wireless network card can be removed, but there may be a hardware lock that prevents other wireless network cards from working on the motherboard. For now, I'm happy with the Atheros card that's in there, as it's compatible with some penetration testing software I have. There's a limited amount of tinkering that can be done on this Ultrabook, and I do feel some is necessary to get the most out of this notebook (replace HDD with SSD).Despite some of its flaws, the underlying common denominator that makes this worthy of a purchase is it's price. You get a lot of Ultrabook for not too much money. With some tweaks, such as replacing the HDD, and maybe reintigrating the Start button via the $4.99 Stardock Start 8 program, it can be a great Ultrabook for casual and advanced users alike.","November 29, 2012",1
laptops,"Good laptop, albeit a few issues",DanP,R14Q565EEHG78W,3,"There were many different opinions about this laptop among the reviews when I bought this, so here is my two cents about this laptop. I bought the Asus S56CA two days ago on Amazon and have spent a lot of time working with it. Right out of the box I was impressed with its weight and thickness. Upgrading from a six year old HP laptop, the S56CA seemed worlds apart with its slim form. Purchased mostly for word processing and email, it runs fast and quiet. I am typing this review from my ASUS laptop. Some of the things I like about this laptop are -- Looks great!- Great laptop for school and office- Includes a SSD drive- It stays fairly cool during use- Asus complementary 1 year accident protection warrantyThere are however a few things that needs to be addressed -- First and foremost, Windows 8 is not great (that is an understatement). It is not intuitive or very user friendly. While this isnt something ASUS can control, I wish the laptop came with Windows 7 as well, at least until 8 is sorted out.- The single most issue about this laptop itself however that mine has a poor touchpad. It seems to suffer from a sensitivity issue where my webpages would zoom in and out at the slightest touch, and scrolling only works half the time. It should also be mentioned that the touchpad buttons are somewhat clacky. The sensitivity issue I am having is bad enough to knock a star off this review. Trying to find a solution to this.- As some other reviews have mentioned, wi-fi connectivity can sometimes be spotty. Mine would randomly loose my home wi-fi isignal before finding it about a minute later. This happens about two to three times a day.Things that I think are just 'OK' about this laptop and not necessarily cons are -- Battery life is pretty average. I get close to three hours with a mix of web browsing and watching videos.- The speakers are above average for a laptop, but their placement at the bottom of the laptop could have been different. When I place the laptop on surfaces the sound is muffled.- Back-lit keys would have been a nice feature!Overall, I like this laptop and would rather try to resolve the touch pad issue than return the laptop. If I cannot find a solution online I will contact ASUS and test out their customer support. I have purchased ASUS non-laptop products before and have had good experiences up till now. I hope you find this review useful, and please keep in mind that this was my experience with the S56CA, and yours could be different.-","July 24, 2013",1
laptops,asus,paul p.,R2S0MML5DAIU2Z,3,Hard disk went out shortly after arrival but ASUS delt with it quickly and at no charge to me. It is running great now and I purchased on sale for $325. Worth it.,"July 12, 2013",1
laptops,Was Awesome...,Sandra Furbush,R2PP0RVXVDXJ12,3,"I purchased this laptop to replace the HP that I got in 2007. This laptop was exactly what I was looking for, and since its an Ultrabook, it is really thin, and looks very nice. The battery life isn't outstanding, but it's a small 4 cell battery, which does really add to the aesthetics of this laptop. I loved everything about it, except the CD drive stuck out a bit from the rest of the laptop, and after opening it a few times, the silver paint on it has worn down, and it doesn't look as good anymore.So fast forward to 3 months after purchase. I turn it on, and the power button lights up, but nothing on the screen at all. Nothing to an external monitor either. So I frantically call up ASUS, and within 15 minutes they have me boxing it up to send it in. They do pay for the shipping to get it to them, just make sure it's packed good because they aren't responsible for damage during shipping. That was a week ago, and the tracking says it's there, but haven't heard anything yet. They told me they weren't responsibly for lost files during repair and that I should back all my files up...well that's kind of hard to do when it doesn't even turn on properly and can't be used. It was only 3 months old so I didn't have a whole lot of stuff on there, but none the less I'm not planning on my files still being on it when I get it back. One of the reasons I bought this ASUS Ultrabook was because of the warranty, especially the ADP full coverage, as well as the fact I'm using a ASUS motherboard on the computer I built and it's been running great for 4 years.Hopefully it's a motherboard issue, and they won't have to mess with my hard drive, I think it is because I couldn't get it to boot into the BIOS or anything. Well we shall see, I will update this review once I found out the diagnosis, but for the time being I'm back using my 2007 HP DV6000.","April 3, 2013",1

laptops,"Finally good, after a headache.",ella,R2AU632WE9ZHN5,3,"Pros:-beautiful design-lightweight & easy to carry-included Ethernet adaptor just in case-included carrying case-starts quickly-charges quickly-all USB 3.0-cheaper than Macbook Air (and it's not a Mac!)Cons:-only 2 USB ports-had to order an HDMI cable separately (Asus makes one it's on Amazon) even though they included a VGA adaptor which is kind of unnecessary-battery life is inconsistent-screen brightness randomly changes and will switch from one energy plan to another on its own-has yet to successfully connect to my school's wireless network, but fine at home, library, etc, so it is probably the school's issue, but no one else has problems nor did my Asus Nexus 7 tablet, so I don't really know what the deal is thereI purchased this laptop in September 2013 for school not from Amazon. (I didn't realize it was on here!) So far (3 months) the computer itself is running fine. However, the screen has been one disasater after another. The second time I used it, I started getting this vertical black bar down the screen. I sent it back, they replaced the display, I thought all was good. Nope. After a little while I noticed it had a single dead pixel. I wasn't having that. Sent it back again, even though they said the screen was out of warranty (30 days), they replaced the screen again, and so far so good. Knock on wood.Definitely a headache, and it was really tough to do this semester basically without a computer, which is totally unacceptable after I spent close to $1000 on the thing.Asus customer service was good enough, but it would have been nice if they paid for packaging on top of shipping. I had to spend $16 for the box each time ($32) to send back a brand new computer that should not have had any problems.I guess I'll see how it holds up over time. Fingers crossed.","December 4, 2013",1
laptops,Sexy Device but misleading hard drive specs.,connie chuck,R26IBZJ56LKF71,3,"This is a very sexy laptop. Thin and light. Decent sound for a compact computer.

laptops,"Nice Product, Incredibly awful customer service, Updated",Jeffrey S,R31NYCXY5CDGW7,3,"I have the taichi since January 26 when it was first released in the US. The laptop itself is very nicely constructed with a few minor flaws.1) The software is kind of buggy when you try to switch from tablet mode into notebook mode.2) The taichi button is useless ( does not work at all for me)The product alone deserves at least 3 out of 5 stars, the biggest problem is the customer service.One day for whatever reason, the outer screen has a crack along the vertical surface and was not functional.I have never drop once but this is not what I am trying to argue.Anyway the screen cracks and I send it back to Asus in California.They did provided me with a return shipping label so I did not have to pay at all.But here comes the problem, the fixing process is never ending!!!The laptop arrived at their service facility on May,7, and here I come writing this review after 20days of waiting.Maybe this is common in the electronic industry, but I found this to be unacceptable given how little work you need to do fix a small product like that( 3 weeks= 15business day = 120 business hours!)The most annoying part is the fact that their customer support are deceiving.I have contacted them four times in totalEvery time I contact them, they will promise me to check on status and respond to me within 48 hours, of course in the end no one called me.Online Chat1st time: the item is taking a little longer than usual, but they are coming up with a quote soon2nd time: the item is still under progress and we will escalate the case for you and have an update asap3rd time: the item is almost done!Phone Call4th time: I am sorry for the wait but it is still in progress, in the end he told me that to be honest, he does not know when is it going to be done. (please be patient)I really like asus's product, I have their sound card, a wifi adapter and a monitor, their never fail me.But this time, wow!!!If laptop cost is based on availability hours, then I am already getting a 15% off discount at the moment.I am lucky that I have a desktop , but imagine if your car is broken for 3 weeks and you are not allow to get a rental.Update 6/16/2013: 2 days after I contact Mark who is in the Asus Customer Loyalty department, the status finally went from repairing in progress to shipped.So the whole process take about a month.

laptops,A digital artist perspective,M. Quickel,RW0EPQH3RYT8G,3,"I bought this machine in February and was really excited when it came, although it was a pretty pricey machine.I think for the most part, if you're content with just using the device for general purposes, then this is a great device. But then again, you can get a basic touch screen laptop for half the price of the Taichi.I bought it so I could use the stylus to make art. For me, I use programs like Photoshop and ZBrush, which rely on the WinTab driver to function properly. Both ASUS and N-Trig (the company that develops the stylus) have ping-ponged me back and forth for the past 6 months. Without the WinTab driver, the pen does NOT have the 256 levels of pressure sensitivity as advertised. In fact it has no sensitivity at all. While I do understand that non-artists would use the stylus, to me it seems like a more artist driven tool - one without a real use for a semi-serious artist on the Taichi.You also can't use programs like ZBrush and PS with the lid closed very well since they rely on keyboard shortcuts to function well. There are external options like the bluetooth keyboards but why?The icing on the cake is ASUS support. They claim to have a VIP line for Taichi owners. One day I was on hold for 47-minutes and gave up. That was the general vibe of calling them over the past few months. There can't be THAT many Taichi owners out there. :)But I seriously wish I could emphasize the incompetence and lack of real care the ASUS support team has. I had 1 agent and 1 supervisor tell me they were going to look into my issue and call me back (and never did) and every time I tried to call and explain the driver situation they knew nothing about how their own technology worked. I literally have never has a worse customer experience than I did with ASUS.I'm actually going to be looking for something else since this doesn't work for me. I don't need a $1200 machine to play Angry Birds with the touch screen.I will miss the backlit keyboard and the slick design of the device.Hope I was helpful to anyone else looking to use this for similar purposes.","July 19, 2013",1
laptops,"""VIP SERVICE FROM HELL""!",Onmie Butouch,R1AUFVSNA9GA9D,3,"Neat concept. A bit pricey.Came loaded with Windows 8. Ignore the ""alerts"" form ASUS telling you about the free upgrade to Windows 8.1 unless you really want an expensive door stop or want to spend a week trying to get it to work again!""VIP SERVICE"" from Asus is a joke ...I am still waiting (for over a month) for an answer from them...NO HELP AT ALL!I really like some of the features in 8.1 but ASUS did NOT have their poo together on the drivers for the TAICHI.After 8.1 upgrade the system became very unstable, screens flashed and/or did not work at all. Dual screen ""Taichi"" mode is still flakey even after reverting back to Windows 8.At this price one would expect better support from ASUS. Wish I would have waited for one pre-loaded with 8.1 (Have they done that?) After messing with this for several weeks I took it to a computer store to get it working again. (At my COST). It took the ""experts about 10 hours to get it ""somewhat"" working again. Love the machine but hate the company ""support"". (I use the term loosely). WiDi for my ""push to TV"" still does not work, ""Taichi button"" intermittently works, screen brightness has a mind of it's own.Bottom line: ASUS needs to spend less time trying to sell me other products and more time coming up with a fix for a machine they promoted with a ""free upgrade to windows 8.1"". Doubt I will ever buy another product from them.Added 12/20/2013:One thing I meant to mention and forgot:For the life of me I don't understand how they (IMHO) blew it on the camera. The Taichi has two, but they are both ""front facing"". Great if you want and/or need a expensive mirror. Would have made (again IMHO) more sense if in tablet mode the camera would have been rear facing for making videos! In notebook configuration front facing for Skype would have be fine.","December 10, 2013",1
laptops,Intermittent is the key word here,Mr. Anom,RY1B6JHXOA4D9,3,"This is a great idea on paper and gets good marks for the initial effort. A firmware update is really needed for this convertible to operate as advertised. Part of the problem is the implementation of Windows 8. This machine seems to sometimes fight for what it wants to do against Windows. Things like the the lights constantly flickering as the brightness constantly adjusts, the touch pad scrolling working intermittently, the touch screen scrolling also working intermittently and so on.On the plus side, this convertible is light enough and the form factor is a joy to use. But use as a tablet is hampered by the touchscreen browser experience. You'll close the lid in frustration and resort to using it as an ultra book in all but mandatory drawing activities. Also, one of my biggest pet peeves is the super bright Windows button on the tablet side of the computer. Super annoying as you can't shut it off or dim the beam as it shines directly into your soul (and eye). I really hate that button and it keeps me from being able to comfortably enjoy reading (via the Kindle app)in tablet mode (one of my big reasons for buying this). It's also annoying when trying to watch a movie and you'll end up just opening the laptop up, turning off the keyboard light and using it that way (although there is still the mildly annoying wifi light that only turns off when you turn off wifi, which in turns turns off any streaming you're probably doing).Not going to go much more into Windows 8, but anything you don't like about it is probably present here. Having you swipe to get things done is one thing, but when that feature randomly stops working (happens a lot), it turns into another dance of frustration. And don't get me started on the Windows Store or it's apps. Super half baked. The quality of the few apps are terrible and most times take away features of the normal (Windows 7)desktop programs. Trust me, skip most ""8"" versions and use the regular (Windows 7)programs instead. You're welcome. A lot of programs still struggle to fight through the bloat that is Windows 8. Super small example, Skype won't ever go away unless you exit out of the program. It just sits in your toolbar refusing to go away. ""X"" means nothing.So to sum things up... If you're offered a really good deal on this and it's cheaper than a comparable ultra book, then go for it. A lot of the Windows 8 problems are going to be universal, so you're going to have to work around them if you want a new ""8"" laptop. The second screen is slick and the transition from laptop to tablet is really well done, so if you have business need for the second screen then go for it. As primarily a media viewer and consumption device, pass on this for a cheaper ultra book.","September 17, 2013",1

laptops,Great concept. Decent machine.,Lynel Hudson,R3V5RMGEQTM0GM,3,"Back when I was eyeing this on amazon i imagined it being the perfect hybrid. I believe it is one of the more interesting ones. But i couldnt give it a perfect score for a few reasons. First off let me just state I got the i5 version and i got it used for around $680 with shipping. Because it was used it came with a few minor issues such as barely noticable scratches and a hard to see light area on the touch screen. but i'm ignoring these issues when writing this review.This is a very capable machine with a fairly sturdy and solid feel. Ive managed to game on it (eve online), use virtual machines on it, transfer large files etc. and it seems to have the power to do all of these without any problems. It is a great all around machine. And looks nice too. I love the size and weight, design is awesome.The reason its a 3 star product instead of a 4 or 5 star one is simple: in my experience its kind of buggy. Annoyingly so sometimes. I could be in laptop mode with the touchscreen completly off and out of no where its like a ghost is using the touch screen. Moving stuff around, closing windows etc. its difficult to fix without just turning the power off.I have a windows 8.1 pro dvd and yes i reinstalled several times and made sure to download any drivers it needed. It may be i missed a few drivers ( i hope) but this is a serious problem to me. Another issue i have from time to time is the trackpad stops recognizing gestures. So the Asus Taichi isnt all the way perfect, but if its your first windows windows 8 hybrid/ultrabook you might just fall in love with it.","April 15, 2014",1
laptops,A True Netbook,matt kramer,R38C0F2NQMWYIV,3,"The chromebook is exactly what a netbook should have been. It is basically a cheap device that lets you surf the internet with the convenience of a keyboard....nothing more and nothing less. I actually prefer this to an ipad or any other tablet for two simple reason. 1) it is half the price of an ipad and 2) it has a physical keyboard. By no means does the device feel cheap. I would say you are getting far more quality than $250 worth. The best way to describe the keyboard would be a that of a macbook air, but slightly cheaper feeling (more plastic). The trackpad is also very good...better than 3/4 of the ones on current PC's. I am use to using a mac, so you can change the trackpad to scroll similarly by going to trackpad settings in the chrome browser and choosing ""enable simple scrolling"".All in all this is a fantastic netbook. I would also like to note the apps are kind of useless b.c they are basically just bookmarks to the websites. Battery life is a solid 7 hours, and the device runs smooth as butter. The only thing I have noticed that is strange is the trackpad is god awful if you are charging the device and using it. This may be fixed with an update, but the trackpad becomes very buggy.******updated*******After a little more time with the device, there are a few things I cannot get passed. I previously mentioned the trackpad acting up when charging, and it seems like that is not the only thing. The graphics become very glitchy and render the device unusable while charging. Also, I have started to notice a very annoying flicker while using the browser, which is also a big deal since 100% of the time that is where my time is spent. There is a strong possibility that my device is defective since I have not seen mention of these problems. The flicker occurs when I move the mouse around and have chrome open, and it is mostly noticeable at the top of the screen.","December 8, 2012",1
laptops,In love with this! **UPDATE**,Brittany,R3AQOFGFKUQWVS,3,"As I am typing this review with this product I can say that I absolutely love it! It is absolutely perfect for my needs. I'm not a ""tech geek"" or anything but I definitely appreciate being able to have a laptop which is extremely lightweight and so easy to bring with me just about everywhere. As a college student, this compact device is better than having a tablet as it is compatible with certain programs which the tablet I have is not. It is just as convenient, but more useful to me.I love how simple and quick everything is. Start up is within seconds, no loading screens, no nonsense. Log in and go. Also, shutting down is only seconds as well. My previous laptop had issues with shutdown and I couldn't close the screen until it was completely shut down or else it would interrupt the process. That usually took a few minutes. With the Chromebook, it's click, shut, and go. And shutting down rather than just closing saves battery life, even though that really is not an issue. While being used, it's currently calculating I have 90% battery left which adds up to 7 hours and 12 minutes. This is just great!With the exception of getting used to the placement of the keys on the keyboard (slightly different from a standard keyboard) I really enjoy how quiet typing is. I can sit and work on emails or papers in the library or at night without disturbing anyone because the keys aren't making a loud ticking noise as I am typing.Another feature, which was a huge selling point as I have had issues in the past, is the lack of fan and moving parts. It is very frustrating to have a laptop which can't be placed in your lap because it gets too hot. This laptop is always cool, which the exception of one spot which is barely lukewarm.Getting use to the smaller screen and type was an adjustment at first, but there is a setting feature which allows you to enlarge the type on a page without having to zoom into the screen which I like.Essentially, the Chromebook is great! It takes a little bit of getting used to but the adjustment only takes a short time. I'm sure there are some other things I haven't discovered and I haven't had a chance to get a good look through all of the apps available. The only small complaint that I have is the inability to stream on Netflix. I guess it's not compatible with the OS yet but they're working on it. But it's only a small complaint because I can use my tablet to watch Netflix and in that case I'm able to work on the laptop while watching movies and shows considering both of them are small and don't take up too much space.Overall, I am very happy with my new ""toy."" I've been bringing it with me everywhere I go!**UPDATE**Should have done this sooner. Unfortunately I had to drop my rating on this product only because within a few months I was no longer able to use it. Due to one fall from a counter top to a carpeted floor, my power adapter apparently suffered some unseen damage. (It landed flat on the bottom as it slid off the counter.) This caused the area around the adapter port to somehow overheat and melt. The damage was not immediately obvious to me and the next time I went to unplug my computer, the tiny metal piece snapped off inside the port itself. Because this was caused by a drop and I sadly had not purchased the extra warranty which covers drops, there was nothing I could do. I've considered purchasing another Chromebook, but with the adapter being so fragile, along with the strange sort of malfunction, I'm not sure I want to take that risk. It was a great little computer, while it lasted.","February 17, 2013",1
laptops,"Great for some, okay for most, but not for me.",Nicholas C. Barnes,R6M9SJ9102YUM,3,"The chromebook itself is very lightweight, and sufficiently easy on the eyes. It charges quickly, and holds a battery for an impressive amount of time. I give the Chromebook three stars for a lot of reasons. The brightness of the screen is what ultimately ruined the experience for me. While I'm sure the dulled brightness serves a purpose in regards to battery and the overall price of the product, it is simply an aspect that I could not overcome. The trackpad is a multi-touch, useful touchpad.. when it works. I noticed that my interactions with it were choppy, and I got somewhat frustrated. Once I had the general knack of the Chromebook down, the trackpad had issues keeping up with my swift movements. Overall, this is a great laptop for first-time computer owners, younger children, or college students who are looking for a computer they can toss into their bag and go. However, it is not a product that I could see myself using as a sole computer. The dim screen prevented me from being able to type a paper without getting a headache. The way a product presents information (aka, screen) and how the user interacts with it (trackpad) are two of the most vital aspects of a product such as this; in my opinion anyway.","November 1, 2013",1
laptops,"Great value, rotten power connection",W. Tyler,RDQRQX45Y3DTA,3,"The computer itself is a great value.

I bought it for a famliy member who has managed to break off three of these mosquito-sized connectors in as many months. A more careful user won't necessarily have problems, but the thing is so thin and fragile that you have to take more than ordinary care to avoid snapping it off. Other than that, I would have given it five stars.","January 21, 2013",1
laptops,Not enough travel in the keys and trackpad tough to use,DesertDweller,R3MURTE6H20818,3,"I think the idea behind this device is great, to have a system that is pared down and just for Internet, email, watching non-HD videos on Youtube, and the like. I am using a netbook that I bought 3 years ago, using WinXP,and it has slowed down badly over time. Can't even play Youtube videos without stuttering any more, sometimes to the point where I give up trying to watch. If the chromebook can deliver a device that won't have that problem, I'd love it. So that's why I bought it. The execution of the idea, I found, has a couple issues. First, I had some difficulties with the keyboard and trackpad. And then I found out that the particular device I had is defective. Those two issues are discussed in more detail, in the next two paragraphs.I only used this device for a few hours last evening, when it functioned normally. It was pretty nice then, with a nice bright screen and everything very intuitive and easy to use. On the downside, I thought the cursor movement in response to the trackpad was a bit slow, even after I found the ""settings"" and set it for max speed. Also, Chrome doesn't seem to have a setting that makes the cursor fly all the way to the edge of a window once you have set it in motion, which you get with Windows. The cursor only moves as long as your finger is in contact with the trackpad and moving. However, the trackpad does have 2-finger scrolling, and a tap with 2 fingers gives you a ""right click,"" which are nice features. I was going to keep the device and study up on all the features, and I figured it would get easier for me to use with practice on this particular keyboard and trackpad.Unfortunately, this morning I discovered that my unit is defective. On the third boot-up, the trackpad had stopped working. The cursor would barely respond, if at all, to finger movements across the trackpad. Samsung customer service is good, BTW (this is my 2d Samsung laptop). I got them on the phone, and these were the troubleshooting steps they had me try: (1) re-boot - which I had already tried before phoning them, (2) tap the ""escape"" key several times - no change there (3) do a ""drumroll"" with two fingers on the trackpad - no joy (4) do a factory reset, using the following keys, held down together: Shift - Ctrl - Alt - R. After the factory reset (which the Chromebook calls a ""powerwash"") the trackpad became responsive for a minute or two. But before I could even get back to connecting with my wifi, it cut out again.Bottom line: I would have liked to use this device for a longer period of time before reviewing it. Based on what I was able to do with it, I felt it was about a 3 - 4 because of my criticisms of the keyboard and trackpad that I wrote in paragrah 2. In light of the defect in this example of the system, I'm going with 3 stars. I'll send this back for refund, and apply the money to getting a PC or Mac. I'm glad there is a 3d choice out there now, but at the moment I guess it is not for me.Edit, later on: I didn't get the device packed up and sent back right away, so I gave it one more chance last evening. Starting over from the most recent reset to factory settings, I used it to edit text, happily, for a few hours. I take back what I said about ""not enough travel in the keys."" I seem to have adjusted, and the typing was OK. BUT, once the power got low enough for the device to prompt me to plug it in - bam, as soon as I plugged in the power supply, the trackpad stopped working properly again. So today, the device went back to Amazon, for credit. Don't worry, Amazon, I'll probably buy the Windows system from you later, anyway.","August 10, 2013",1

laptops,Fun toy,Philip J. Warburton,R18ULEYVT2GWMI,3,"I really liked it until the screen cracked seemingly on its own, less than a month after I got it. Apparently, this is a common issue, which I found out when searching for a screen replacement. I was carrying it in a bag with three other laptops and a 10"" tablet, and they are all fine, so I really have no idea how it could have happened. I got a replacement. I had noticed that the keys were leaving imprints on the screen, so I purchased some rubber feet and put them on the new laptop at the top of the screen bezel, hopefully this will prevent future problems. If I don't edit this review, it means the screen hasn't broken again...Aside from that, it's a very interesting machine. The performance is very good, especially with a single browser window it seems much more responsive than regular laptops of comparable price. The picture quality of the screen is good, the keyboard is comfortable, and it's very quiet due to the lack of a fan. I bought it more for purposes of having an ARM machine to play with, and as far as that goes it's probably the best option - it's very accommodating to developers.","April 17, 2013",1
laptops,"Nice Product, but limited use!",Alex,R3M73OW4AURL0Z,3,"The build quality is great and comes on quickly, but in my first few minutes with it I have discovered that you can't access a site that uses quicktime. There is not a plug in for the OS. You can get one for chrome running on a windows machine etc., but not for the Chromebook. If you are not connected to the internet a Chromebook is fairly worthless. They are designed for the connection and they include 100gb of cloud storage for 2 years. After the 2 years what you have uploaded can be accessed, but nothing can be added without renewing the subscription. The screen was plenty bright for me and very readable. The keyboard is awesome and the mouse pad is great as well. My problem with the device lies in the OS itself, which may be great for someone just wanting to type a few things and search the internet, but is lacking for someone that expects this device to replace a windows or mac laptop.","March 18, 2013",1
laptops,Best buy in its price category,Michiel Esveld,R1NP4T5J4O75HQ,3,"I bought this product using amazon.com (US) and Comgateway in order to obtain it. Living in Brussels (Belgium), this particular chromebook is not officially available in the European mainland as far as I know. This is the first drawback, it costs me additional fees to get it here via an intermediary company.Before I start with the critics I want to state that I serieously recommend this product to every everyday user of the internet. It is way better and efficient than using a much more expensive tablet. I think that most of the positive critics are already widely known due to Googles campaign and other news media writing about this product. So I will predominantly focus on the not so great experiences I sometimes had with this product the first few weeks after I received it.Startup, screen, speakersOn the functioning of the Chromebook: It works great! Seriously fast startup time as well as opening files etc. (due to the 16gb SSD) the screen is very clear and the speakers work fine. Keep in mind that I say this with the price category in mind. it is not a full-HD screen and the speakers are small and of mediocre quality compared to any high-end stereo system. Still equal or better than most notebooks I used.Bodythe plastic body is again of low cost quality but suffices when treated when care you'd expect from a notebook user. the four pads on the bottom that are used for support are working well, when on a hard surface it does not slip. A serious drawback is the thickness of the rubber supporters. just a small grain of hard material can cause loads of scratches on the bottom side. Like most notebooks the battery gets quite warm when using the charger or watching a long video like a movie. The absence of a hard drive (no fan) helps not getting overheated though.keyboard and touchpadthe keyboard is GREAT. I really like that Google kept the standard size despite of having a relatively small screen. It works great. not flaws whatsoever. Instead of the Caps-lock key there is a search key. Example of added application value: having a lot of bookmarks, it is much more efficient to just hit the search button and type the first 2-3 letters of the webpage, enter, of you gothe touchpad is another story; it works very precise, the clicking and tapping as well. But when the chromebook is charging, half of the time the touchpad is not precise at all. up and down, left and right movements are far from precise and diagonal movement is just impossible. One will see a zig-zag snake movement.Functioning Chrome OSChrome OS is working smooth most of the time. It is told that although it is a very stripped down operating system it works perfectly for its main goal: Getting the user the best internet experience. In my opinion this works great most of the time but there were several instances, especially when streaming videos and using the full screen mode, that the screen just goes black and one had to use the escape button to get it back working again. other more serious problems occurred also when in the same situation as mentioned before but then the whole system would all of a sudden shut down, for no reason. the last system failure I have experienced also for several times was that it just got stuck when playing a video in full screen mode. In the manual there is no solution for such a situation mentioned but i just pressed the on/off button for several seconds and the system would restart like nothing went down. So the stability of the system is seriously debatable in my opinion. fingers crossed that the automatic updates will solve these problems...Last point I want to critisize, is that loads of programs are not compatible (yet) with Chrome OS. Applications like Skype and Silverlight do not work on Chrome OS. Maybe because the group of users is still relatively small or maybe for other reasons. I hope google or the simple increase of Chrome OS user would change the minds of the companies that do not have made there applications Chrome OS compatible.Looking back at the above mentioned criticism, I do not want to create an image of this chromebook to be not good. I like it very much and use it every day. I love the product I got for the money I spend. It is just that one has to keep in mind that it is 'just' $250,- and Chrome OS has just started its rise to power in the market!","March 15, 2013",1
laptops,Unit purchased as new proved to be used,Celiakelly,R1E7M47015BF2Y,3,"This Chromebook was purchased as a new item. We found that it had been previously used as there was a ""user"" logged in whose profile had to be erased before we could use the unit.","September 29, 2013",1

I can't get mad and be surprised at the fact it wasn't new because better models of it have came out since. I guess you can say it is worth the 100 from working at a cell phone store.

However, the speaker on the front of the phone (for calls in non-speakerphone mode) Doesn't work very well. I had to buy a bluetooth headset so I can hear my calls. The camera and video recorder work great. Some apps don't work with this phone. For instance, a lot of apps take forever to load, or it just makes the phone freeze, which brings me to my next point.

mobile phone,"Well, OK but sometimes complicated","Virginia Rowland ""Ginger""",R1HWJUOU7RH2L,3,"I've had this phone for 4 days now, and still don't feel like I know how to use it. Some aspects seem confusing. I should preface that by saying that I am not a young person, and technology is not second nature. This review will, I hope be understood by someone who, like me, is older and finds learning new things a little slow.The basic phone part is different, and when receiving a call, you need to slide a symbol over to the right in order to answer. I haven't decided whether this is operator trouble or whether this key is not working properly, but I can slide that key only about half of the time, so I miss the call and have to return it. I am told that when I get used to the touch screen, that probably will not happen. Hope this is true. (had a touch screen with my old phone, but it wasn't a smart phone and had a much different feel.)I probably won't be using the email messaging that much, as I feel much more comfortable doing that on my laptop.I plan on using this phone to play music on a docking station, and it works fantastic for this purpose, I'm able to access the internet radio stations and play anything I want to. Great , I got the phone to do just that.Now for what really is sticking in my craw. I received this phone very quickly, inserted the battery, activated the phone, but I found that since this one does not support backup, I took it to my local verizon store to have them transfer my contacts and pictures. We then discovered that this phone did not contain an SD card, which enables you to take pictures and save them and keep them in the phone. Old pictures could not be transferred until they installed one at $20.00. This seller failed to inform me that this was not included, and technically, it said the order contains a phone, wall charger, and manual, so in that respect they were indeed correct. If you are like me, you are not aware of things like this and frankly, I felt a little cheated, although technically, they win, they just didn't bother to inform the buyer that is was missing. So......the main thing I want you to know about this phone, or any refurbished phone you may purchase, you will need to educate yourself as to what is needed to fully operate this phone, and ask the seller if it is included. My seller offered to send me one free of charge, which would have delayed the use of this for another several days, and it was just easier to have one put in while I was transferring my personal stuff from the older phone. The seller assured me that they were not out to cheat me, but my point is that if they would send me one for free, they should have put it in the phone before they sent it to me.For more accurate information on this phone read the reviews here, they helped me decide to buy one, and I'm sure when I get used to it, I will like it. Much more to learn and know than with a basic phone, but when I get over the bad feeling about the SD card, I'm sure it will be just fine. :(","July 9, 2012",1

mobile phone,Quirky - but ok,"BettyWriter ""BettyWriter""",R113MTTU6VG57Y,3,"This phone arrived just before I left for Italy. I took it with me, but wasn't able to use it overseas because I hadn't set it up in my plan, however when I returned I used it quite a bit. I like it, but it's quirky. I don't text much, but the first time I did, I realized that the punctuation marks were not where the keys indicated. Press the exclamation key and it actually types quotes, press the question mark key to get left parenthesis, and the apostrophe key yields a question mark, etc.On top of that, I wanted to call the ferry service to make sure I had the time of the last ride home, but it was impossible for me to figure out how to call 1-877-44FERRY. On my old phone numbers were on letter keys, and it was simple. With dedicated number keys, 1-0, it was impossible to type in the letters because on my old phone an 'F' is on the '3' key, but on this phone, with the control-key activating the numbers, the 'F' key is on the '4' key; not at all linear, and the 'Y"" key is not connected to a number at all. I was stressed enough that I couldn't pull up a mental image of the old phone's alpha-numeric setup to use. Bad day at Black Rock, but I got the last ferry back home, anyway.It's too late to request a return, so I'm stuck. As a phone, it's fine. I use it occasionally to check my email, and am getting used to its quirks when I send the occasional text. It's larger than I like, but that's normal for a smartphone.","July 14, 2011",1

I have been searching for a replacement cell phone to my old Nokia C3 for a while.I give my old Nokia C3 a 4 star rating. I don't want a ""smart phone"" but I do want the ability to get on the internet. My old C3 did not require a ""hot spot"" wifi to get on the internet, the phone I just purchased does. It does not have the WAP internet configuration on the phone like my old one does. I called AT&T; and got no help. (its all about the money, because I did not buy the phone from them). Anyway my old phone still works for internet use, I love to read news from all over the country and all over the world. The old C3 can pick up the internet at times when my wife's I phone can't. I use the new phone for talking mainly, although I do use the hot spot wifi sometimes. You can't do the video or sound thing with these phones but I am not much into that anyway. the phone is sturdy and has easy to use functions.

mobile phone,Good for what it is for...not for everyone,MollieDuke,R38VGFSZSYUDT7,3,"This was for my son to replace a phone he damaged at work. He is a college student, but is a foreman for his scene shop, so he's always on call. He needed a qwerty keyboard because he sends/receives so many texts about things at the theatre, that it's easier. BUT, due to his job, he's always banging himself (and phone) on wood pieces, metal grating, ladders, etc. SO a full screen front was out of the question.......that's how he damaged the other one. PLUS cost was a major factor knowing he'll damage it again, probably. He liked the fact that on the school wireless he could always check email with this phone, too. Again, important to his job. This phone is NOT 3G, it is NOT a smart phone, it is NOT able to access internet/email from anywhere. Just places where wifi is available (like a college campus).All that said, it fit the bill for him very well. He likes it thus far, though he's only had it at school less than 2 weeks. He says it seems fine for what he needed it for. The reason for 3 stars is just that for MOST folks this won't do as much as they want.However, if you're looking for a smartphone alternative for a college student who is nearly always on the school interface, this works as a very nice inexpensive alternative.","January 5, 2012",1

mobile phone,Too Small for Big Hands,DM,R117KC67FABVJ9,3,"The overall functions and durability of the phone are fine. It has a loud ringer. At times it is hard to hear a caller when ear is up against phone.

mobile phone,All the little annoying things add up,betabuyer,R38II3G38U5W21,3,"Okay this is overall a good phone. So far it seems to do everything I need it to do, and I only paid about $80 for it.However, I am starting to discover little things that bother me. First, there is no external volume button. You have to press a few buttons to get to the menu to change the ring volume.Second, there is not a brightness control. If you are in a bar (which I am in a lot) your face will light up because of the bright screen. I end up holding the phone at an angle to avoid embarassment. Also the screen will go black after 8 seconds and there is no way to change this power saving feature.When you are composing a text message, there is no quick way to save it to send later.I would exchange the phone for another but I think it is too late (I bought it at a local store in Mexico). So I will keep it until it breaks. It just annoys me that these little features have been excluded so that you will want to buy another phone (Nokia hopes you will upgrade I imagine). Kindof like how windows always has things wrong with it so that you need the next version.","September 3, 2012",1

I would rather pay a little more and have more functionality. This phone is pretty basic and the price is not bad, but again, I am going to apply my refund to something with more features, like touch screen and a larger screen.

mobile phone,Pretty Good with symbian Belle.,Marcos Almeida,R2TKS83OXA9VYU,3,"This is a nice handset. The battery life is amazing compared to android handsets. I own Samsung Vibrant, HTC G1, and HP veer. Nokia N8 is really great for an entry level smart phone. If you rely heavily on Google services, this isn't the handset for you. If you want a device that is very good at the specific tasks of: Navigation, Taking Photos, Media Playback, texting, email and phone calls, this is a great choice. I load up my micro sd and listen to podcasts broadcast to the FM radio in my car on my daily commute. I never have to worry about charging my phone at work. The picture quality is fantastic in regular lighting. The set up was WAY more complicated than I have ever experienced on any handset. It is a good buy for a basic user. My biggest gripe is that there is no way to sort the app reviews in the App Store by language! I have to pass 50 or so arabic, spanish, and italian reviews before I see one English app review that says ""cool"".","March 30, 2012",1

mobile phone,"Good, but not great",craig chambers,RM58W5ZE336SC,3,"Bought this to replace my trusty Nokia E71. Looking for fullscreen email and browsing phone, although my primary need is great call call quality anywhere in the world. I'm not a big apps person and only a moderate texter, Twitterer and Facebook user.Bottom line, the phone was returned. Music player interface was too clunky (can't play find/play a song only artist from shuffle mode), automatic Bluetooth connection with my Acura was too hit or miss (E71 is consistently rock solid with the same car)and QuickOffice not included (must be purchased separately). eMail w/ embedded HTML still does not work within Mail for Exchange.Liked the fullscreen email and browser, but the navigation was clunky (not just different, unintuitive). Having the larger screen does make browsing and emails much easiser to read and reply to. The screen is great both for reading and typing. Didn't miss the hard keys as much as I thought I would, although I agree with the other posts that a portrait keyboard would be nice for those of us used to one-handed typing.As with all Nokias, call quality and battery life were awesome. I was nervous not being able to swap batteries on multi-day trips to India and China but the N8 battery had enough capacity for the one trip I made while I had it.As the price as come down, the N8 is worth it for you gadget people and people that need a fullscreen phone. For those of us who just want something that works, an E71 or perhaps an E72 is just fine.","February 27, 2011",1
mobile phone,A Very Well Featured Phone in Comparison to Other Smart Phones,scsi_boy,R2ZVR1ZG56RVIS,3,"If you are looking for a fullly featured phone with a camera that can perform as good as a dedicated digital camera in the $200 range, fast WIFI, free navigation with offline maps, look no further. This is your phone. The display in on pars with other smart phones such as Android and iPhone4, which use AMOLED display with a notable exception of iPhone4's retinal display. Night shots with N8 are not comparable to say a dedicated camera that is equipped with a much more powerful xenon flash. In other words, if you do not resize the pics you snapped at night, then you will see noise (even my DSLR Nikon shows a little noise in poor lighting -- can you imagine a phone that is equipped with a much smaller xenon flash). Call quality is outstanding with ear-piece volume really loud so no need to crank up the volume to max when you are in a noisy place. UI is a little dated especially coming from Nexus One, but no worries you can download Nokia's Midnight theme to spice up UI and there are 50 improvements for Symbian ^3 on the way to make users experience even more commendable. The virtual qwerty keyboard is a little slow like the Android 2.1 version. With Android 2.2 version, it seems much faster than N8. Like I pointed out, there are 50 improvements on the way, and one of these improvements might or might not address the issue with responsiveness of the qwerty keyboard.Now for quality control. You have to be patient with N8 b/c you might end up a bad power management unit that is fully recognized by Nokia Corp. (just google it) and read the articles. My first N8 was silver color and it would not even power on, so I had to exchange it (Amazon was very nice about this b/c they sent it overnight for the replacement -- that's customer service). Unfortunately, the replacement, though works, had cosmetic issue on the inner bezel. The blemish was naked eye visible that can be seen under bright lights, so I had to return the phone. I ordered a black one now in the hopes that the black one is a later batch that Nokia may have addressed major issues. The black ones seem to be purchased at higher demand and hence Amazon might have a new batch in their inventory. My point is that I liked the phone over my Nexus One that I am giving Nokia a third chance and also the last. I hope this review helps you.","November 21, 2010",1

mobile phone,Good so far,Lillian,R1FP5Q9DJKF7IH,3,"NEW: 3.7.13: I have had this phone for a bit over two years now. Currently, I lose network connection nearly half the time and have to restart the phone. It also freezes and slow to respond. I like NOKIA because it have endurance but I have to switch to a newer phone soon. (I actually hope to have this phone for at least three years seeing how I paid the full price for it in 2010). This is why I dropped it from 4 to 3 stars.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------I bought this phone back in November 2010, directly from Nokia USA website.The specifications for this phone are amazing. It have the basic programs that one needs such as recorder, bluetooth, wifi. And the OVI store is expanding. There are more apps now than when I just bought the phone.Pros that I like to point out:- Camera with flash and HD video recording, with editing features. (Truly convenient for those moments wanting to capture a good picture)- FM transmitter (Music from the phone to the car wirelessly. Forget the AUX cable!)- Gorilla glass. (Safe from the dangers within my purse such as keys)- True multi-tasking. The phone doesn't heat up or slow down when I have many programs open.- HDMI port- Supports many video and audio codecs. Transfer videos from your computer to your phone via bluetooth and then watch it. Save the time to recode the videos :)- Browser supports adobe flash- Free GPS navigation with voice!Cons:- Doesn't support Netflix or Hulu so I can't watch at my convenience.- Youtube videos are not HD-quality when you watch it in full screen.- The phone freezes up sometimes because of the WIFI. Happened three times so far...- MAJOR CON: I consider the battery life too short. You have to be consistent in charging it daily. Moreover, the battery is built in so it is not removable. Using features such as playing games or watching movies can really drain the battery life.Overall, the pros really outweigh the cons. It can be difficult to adjust to in the beginning but it's easy once you played with it for a few days. I wished I waited and bought from Amazon since the price has fallen. And I would have saved %50 dollars for taxes!","July 9, 2011",1

It has a 41-mp camera, which is completely ground-breaking for a phone.Nothing wrong with this and at $299, it's a bargain, but I'd recommend doubling that and getting the 808 once Amazon offers it.

After using the xperia X10 and Iphone4 in the past few months, I purchased the N8 yesterday. The up's and down's in my opinion, are as follows:1- The N8 UI is as crude as Android. The Iphone 4 wins by miles in this category.2- If you have used Nokia before, the N8 requires very little learning compared to Android and iOS4.3- The iPhone4 screen resolution is the best on any smart phone.4- The iPhone is not the most stylish phone. N8 is disappointing to look at. The best looking of the current crop of smart phones is Android based Sony Ericsson Xperia x10.5- The Xperia x10 has the best battery life.6- The N8 has the best camera of all smart phones ever made.7- The N8 has the most user friendly Bluetooth and Wireless functionality.8- The N8 has the best integration with Outlook. Android and iOS lack flexibility.9- The N8 offers largest storage space of any smart phone if an optional 32gb microSd card is purchased. It costs between 89-110 dollars.10- For a game freak, nothing beats Iphone 4.f you want style over functionality, buy the iPhone 4. If you want to try out Android, go for Xperia X10.

I hated anyting to do with the ""i"" company at the time. Within 3 hours I had the device aced. I could not believe the quality and the ease of operation. Totally idiot proof. IMHO.Well I am now into my third week of head scratching with my Nokia. Yes its smaller which I liked, it has good sound quality, it works with Skype sometimes (but sucks battery power), I was able to get the email configured eventually, it does run Flash, the camera is great, The keyboard system is not unlike any cell phone so its a pain. No querty available. It constantly tries to hook to the cell internet and will not use my wi-fi for many of its functions even when totally connected? Lets just say its a neat little cell phone with some great features but do I wish I had bit the bullet and spent the extra $$$? YEP I sure do. Think real hard as the OS is not widely supported with apps either.Oct 7th. Update - OK - after calling Plantronics I was able to pair my headset and that actually works perfect. I am not ready to give itanother star as yet but it is pretty good value. Would have preferred android OS as the Symbian appears to be a bit of an orphan.July 2012 UPDATE. Said to hell with it and picked up and iPhone. Returned it to the store one week later. Now that I am used to this little gem I found the iClunker heavy and chunky. Yes it was smoother and did work very nicely but the price difference is way out of line. Now that I have really played with both side by side I am happy with my Nokia. Hope this helps someone.","September 25, 2011",1
mobile phone,"Small and tough, maybe too small",Michael,R4UK4RCO9W88L,3,"Because of the size of the phone, the keyboard is difficult to type on. Also, with Nokia/Symbian, you don't have access to very many apps like you do with apple or android. Otherwise it's a great phone, durable, and works well. A good buy if you need an unlocked phone for prepaid use.","April 24, 2013",1
mobile phone,Good Phone.,"Andrew Lee ""Beermonkeybob""",R1P4B2R9W9Z5II,3,"Except for a couple of points. Beware the Software upgrades, If you have the setting exactly how you want them you will need to start again. The OS upgrade erases most programs that you may have downloaded and consiquently have to be reinstalled. Other than that good GPS, Camera, MP3 player and above all mobile phone. Cheaper than an I-phone and its a Nokia so less likely to blow up.","March 13, 2012",1
mobile phone,great if no battery problem,Pits,R18XCRQTBPZ1NA,3,"I got this cell phone next day of my order. Looks very nice, It had 4GB memory card inside but only about 1.5GB are free? I love this product at the begining but after 15 days I got the problem with battery. Eventhough it had full battery line in the evening, I found my phone switched off in the morning. I tried to switched on, it did not. No idea? I took out battery and replaced but no sign of power on. I connected to charger, then switched on then saw there was no battery. Intresting! Generally battery last about 24 hours when I turn off wifi scanning, keypad tone and about 30mins call daily with no message. Then, again after a week, I full charged my cell phone in the morning and in the early afternoon I was listening FM for about half an hour, my phone switched off suddenly then I noticed no battery when connected to charger. Thanks amazon for 1 months free return policy, so I do not have to deal with warrenty and I can order other phone instantlyOverall nokia made this phone with very good operating system, good size and weight but unusual battery behaviour. I never used any other phone than nokia and still looking a good nokia phone.This phone deserve 5 star if good battery life/behaviour, I gave 3 star assuming that problem may exist only with particular phone not overall model.--------------------------------Update Dec 22, 2012I ordered exactly same phone again as a replacement. Its been one and half months now and I have not noticed any battery problems yet. I generally need to charge my cell phone every other day with normal use. So far satisfied.","November 8, 2012",1
mobile phone,beware 32GB uSDHC card may not work with the phone,"William Chao ""opus""",R2F1Q7PX1MY52J,3,"Since there are quite a few user reviews, I will not add any additional comments right now other than to say it is an OK phone.However, I want to let owners (and possible future owners) know that I had purchased a Sandisk 32GB uSDHC memory card when I purchased the phone, and was not able to get map data saved onto the card - the phone would show disk error while downloading the map data either thru the WiFi connection or the Nokia Suite software from a PC. The problem seems to show-up when you have a large download of data to the phone (for example: entire USA map data, or after one or 2 state-specific data). Strange that I did not encounter any issues when restoring backed-up data to the 32GB card, only when downloading map data.Note: the reason I am downloading map data is that when you do a restore to the new memory card, the map data is not copied, presumably Nokia wants you to download the current map data instead of keep using the old data.I then purchased a 16GB Lexar uSDHC card and that worked flawlessly, and I suspect it is software issue related to the phone. Nokia support was not very helpful as they me to reseat the card and try again, which I did many times, including getting another 32GB card thinking the original one was bad.","October 18, 2012",1

FREE maps and GPS. 8 MP camera, yeah, but numbers alone are practically meaningless. The 8MP camera my wife has on her Nokia 900 is far superior in the quality of the pictures. OS is something like ""Symbian"" and is difficult to use. Slow response. Too many times the button senses the touch (lights up) but nothing happens after that. Not very intuitive. Nokia Suite is nice for backup and restore operations using your computer. The model I got is too controlling in what it allows you to delete from the phone. Nice video.","October 28, 2013",1
mobile phone,Good but not great,lonas,R1T5OY5AHD4Q8W,3,"I'm a nokia user since the 1100. This is my first smartphone and the experience with the C6-01 was not great; main reasons are:+ has simbian, so apps availability is limited+ a couple of times the phone has stopped working and only way to solve the issue was to leave it empty the energy of the battery for a full day and then recharge to reset, which left me complete days without cellphone+ web navigation is not fast+ mail app is really slow (I do not use mails frequently in the cell so I was not really affected by this but could be a real problem)What I do like of the cell is that:+ it has radio+ you can connect a micro sd card to expand memory+ its a small smartphone+ its well built and durable+ has good phone functionality!!!!!","June 9, 2013",1

First I thought something with the phone but I think it's Nokia C6-01. Lately, the phone something freeze and I have to take the battery out and back in again. Overall, the phone is not bad but I wish I got one with Android instead of Symbian Belle. Also, I purchased Joiku software to use with the phone and it's not working. The software unable to start.

It can be slow at times...but making calls and occasional text messages has not been a problem.However, because of its WiFi connectivity I use it extensively to check mails and other sites.

mobile phone,Excellent - but...,Janos Gereben,R344KMN0FBF2KH,3,"Initial impression of the Nokia C6-01 is almost all good. It's solid, looks good, easy to use, battery life is remarkable.Problems, perhaps unavoidable: a bit too chunky/heavy (for its size), the screen is not really big enough for mail and web reading, and the on-screen non-Querty keyboard is very 20th century (to get the letter C, you press the ABC key three times... oh, please!)To its credit, Nokia made enlarging the font easy enough, but then you have to keep going back and forth to continue reading.I can't blame the C6 for not being a tablet, but I wonder if I should just rely on my Kindle Fire for web & mail, and not bother with a smartphone.~~~~~~~~Another problem, a big one: the screen does not respond to fingernail or stylus, only fingertips - this is stated in the user guide, but I didn't think much of it...until now.Just spent 15 very frustrating minutes at Starbucks, trying to go on WiFi, unable to click on the box required to accept the AT&T; terms.

I tried charging it overnight to see that it didn't work in the morning. I read somewhere that the cord might be bad so I switched to a different one and the phone finally took the charge. It really is disappointing that the cord was bad right out of the box. I hope the phone continues to work.

mobile phone,Not a bad phone,Emberlynn,R3I4PZPUI6A67C,3,"I had this phone from Verizon without a contract, I bought the phone refurbished which, let me tell you, was a huge mistake. The touch screen was one of my favorite parts about it, if you're a girl, and you get your nails done, you understand. This touch screen, all you have to do is slide the corner of your nail over the screen and it responds. Normal heat activated touch screens are a pain in the buttocks for people with long nails. The touch screen has some problems though, since it responds to pressure instead of heat, it will unlock itself in pockets, purses, bags and otherwise and call/text random people.The fact that I had this phone without a contract means that I got it specifically for texting, and I only had to pay a fraction of the contract price, but prepaid, this phone has some data charges I wasn't expecting. Apparently because the phone has a touch screen, Verizon decided to lable it as a smartphone (which it most certainly is not) and put a minimun data charge onto your bill every month. So instead of paying for the unlimited texting and the calling, which would have only been 50 dollars, I had to add on a data plan, and my bill ended up going up to 75. Now that may not seem like much, but I'm a waitress at a pizzaria, I don't have that much money. Actually, it was that price that made me give up the phone all together and go with another service provider.This phone doesn't have very bad battery problems, as people have been saying. It only does if you leave it on camera in your pocket, or go online a lot (which is a pain in the butt on this phone.) When I had it, I could listen to music all day, and by the end of the day, I would still have a bar of battery left. If you leave this phone sitting, it can stay powered on for up to four or five days. The only battery trouble I had, was these batteries wear out quickly, the battery deos not have a separate backplate, the battery IS the backplate, so if the phone gets dropped, or if it is loose in a bag for long periods of time, it will become loose, and randomly shut itself off. The best fix for that... buy a new battery. they're only about $2 on amazon, and they will fix your problem for a little while.The aqccesories that you can get for this phone aren't great, the cases are cheap and break if the phone is dropped, and because of the design of the phone, they snap off and don't do their job very well. what I found works well are the gel cases, they hug the phone and protect it the way they're supposed to, the only problem is, sometimes the keys don't match up on the keyboard. What I did was, I got a clear case, It makes it easier to see through to where the keys actually are.The keyboard is amazing, its easy to type on, easy to understand, and it was the entire reason I got the phone. When I first decided to get this phone, I was switching from my EnV3, which had software problems and just shut off and never turned back on... I realized that the thing I was going to miss most was the keyboard. The keys are big enough that they are easy to press, and they respond nicely so you don't have to push super hard to get them to work. When the phone is new, sometimes they're stiff, but that's normal and fixes itself with use.All in all, if I wasn't leaning towards a smartphone, I would definately buy this phone again.","June 8, 2012",1
mobile phone,Does have some quirks but still great overall,Erica,R19SVZ4K68PIJN,3,"I've had my enV touch for 4.5 years now, yes the same one. The best part about this phone is it has 2 screen! A touch screen on the outside and a non-touch screen LCD inside when you open it along with a keyboard inside! Huge perk for texters or if you don't want to use the touch screen. It has a 3.2 megapixel camera (only downer is it can't zoom..). The sound is crisp and clear, has the basic tools (calculator, tip calculator, calendar, alarm clock etc), and my battery has lasted this whole time and is still going strong! It hardly ever has to be charged! Now here are the reasons I only gave this phone 3 stars...like others have said, its locking option on the side of the phone will get pushed in my purse a lot by anything so its made quite a few of its own phone calls to people on my contact list...this is eliminated if you have a case or holster but its been pretty annoying. And the other issue that I know other women have had too with it (not men though) is that the touch screen gets moisture in it (unfortunately from makeup on our face and maybe we use our phones more than guys?) and it stops working. The inside LCD will still work and so will the phone, but the outside screen won't. I recently fixed this problem by buying a new digitizer for it, watched a quick video on youtube and replaced it very easily, now it functions perfectly.

mobile phone,touch screen is a pain.,Nancy,RS0OCXRY5ST27,3,"I love many of the features. It has everything I wanted in a phone, but the touch screen does not work well.

mobile phone,Fun introductory type smartphone,Brian Robbins,R1AI9S1SJAYKUB,3,"I picked this up off contract as I've never had a smartphone and wasn't ready to plunge for an Android device. I find that the physical aspects of the Pixi are outstanding. I absolutely love the rubbery feel to the back of the device. It is also very small... but for some I can see as a negative. For me, it is great. It slides EASILY into my pocket and I can forget it's there. This means that the screen is also very small. The touch is very responsive and while the keyboard is also very small, they are exceptionally easy to type on.","March 23, 2011",1
mobile phone,"Great for a backup, unusable if you came from Android / iOS","C. Gonzalez ""Hi""",R3EL3U9M738JIX,3,"Given that it was discontinued (and Palm basically only exists for tax purposes), I wasn't expecting much and therefore I am pleasantly surprised with the Palm Pixi Plus. I purchased this as a backup to my Droid X, which needed to be shipped in to my warranty provider to fix some issues. Initially, I was thinking I had made a mistake and wasted my money on this backup because it was extremely slow, has an extremely small screen, and a keyboard that is made for 13 year olds (aka people with really small fingers).However, after running the updater and settling into how webOS operates, it really isn't that bad of a phone and the keyboard/screen take some getting used to, but don't expect this to come even close to the experience provided by Android, iOS, or Windows phone (there's a reason Palm went under).Phone/Call Quality - 2/5 - I like the form factor as it really fits nice in the hand & pocket, but it weighs virtually nothing and has a terrible audio speaker (literally the worst I have ever heard on a cell phone from the past decade). Additionally, the ""Silencer/Vibrate"" button constantly slips down so basically I'll never be able to hear a ringtone or noise from it which is pretty annoying.webOS - 3/5 - for a virtually dead OS (it's open sourced), it runs decently and has some interesting ways of handling apps / gestures. However, I didn't realize this phone didn't get the webOS 2.0 update; therefore, it's two years old and less face it, outdated when compared to the current competitors. It still blows away any ""feature/gimmick"" phone that the major carriers offer and that alone makes it worth purchasing.Apps - 1/5 - Application support is minimal so don't expect to do much other than surf the web, check your Gmail, and maybe use a really cool Twitter app - that's all I've found literally. Google Maps has been replaced by HP/Bing and it's absolutely terrible, and all social networking apps outside of Twitter are terrible.Backup Potential - 5/5 - It's cheap, a smartphone with data connectivity, and some okay apps.Hey, for under $50 bucks, I can survive with this for a month or so and use it in case my primary phone breaks.","June 14, 2012",1
mobile phone,acceptable for the price,"K. Wang ""kewiu""",R11APUFDB2J1M9,3,"the Palm Pixi is definately the best phone at its price range. You get wifi , 3G, google map (replaced by bing map recently) and full featured browser for the price of a dump phone. Webos is very well designed and easy to use. There are a lot of draw backs, for example the memory is so small it cannot run most of the popular games. The stability is also an issue, the phone gives ""too many cards"" warning every once a while, even if you don't have any cards open, and have to be restarted every one or two weeks to eliminate the issue. Not to mention the slow CUP and glicthy touch screen. With all being said, it still do the job very well in making calls, receive emails, check maps and web surfing.","January 17, 2012",1
mobile phone,Not bad but not great.,Marissa,R1XA4V6QKTJDK2,3,"I use this phone with the Page Plus prepaid company and am happy with the service and reception. Definitely a great deal. Cute little phone for 55 dollars! The keyboard is small yes but the way it's set up, I find it very easy to use and hardly ever fat finger a typo. It's pretty easy to navigate and while the screen is small, it looks nice and the only time I have an issue is with viewing websites. But I really only wanted it for texting and talking anyway which it does well. The processor makes it relatively sluggish and lock up at times but my main complaint is that when I get a notification (eg an incoming text or reminder that pops up on the screen), the person I'm talking to flickers and cuts out for a little while and MY GOD, I can hear myself and whatever noises are on my side through the earpiece. Wind and traffic easily drown out the caller where my older phones didn't have that problem. Basically hearing myself and bg noises in real-time echo. Luckily using a bluetooth headset fixes the noise leak problem since you're not using the pixi's phone hardware so I will deal for now. This is why I knock it down to 3 stars. Talking on my phone is the most important thing to me and it should work well without the need to buy a headset. This phone doesn't and I've found other people on google search who've had the same issue. Otherwise, I love the keyboard, I love the size and how it fits in my hand, love the look, love the price, love the OS, and the many customizations for the OS. I say go for it if you want a cute little semi-smart phone for texting and have a headset to use with it. It's cheap and great for the price!","April 17, 2011",1
mobile phone,Better options out there - but phone has been solid,Larry M,R16JUN2MER24ZT,3,"Our family has used these as our ""poor"" smartphone for over two years with PagePlus. Since we don't have data plans, it is great for texting, syncing gmail calendars and contacts (we use WiFi rather than data), and occasionally listening to music. USB cable lets you easily add mp3s.Downsides:- not supported, old technology.- No apps to speak of.- Setting up a new phone is tricky so search the internet for help (Kitty wireless instructions are good - but you don't need to pay anyone other than pageplus to activate it).Bottom line: There are better options. Ask friends for their old Verizon smartphones if you are looking for a phone to bring to PagePlus. Kids are happier with used iPhones which work on PP (no data).","December 10, 2013",1
mobile phone,Good Phone! Very Compact!,Technocabin,R3HKAN8MH2NP5U,3,"This phone has a usable physical keyboard which is a huge plus in todays virtual world. The interface software is very slick, and easy to use.I think I know why the backs on these phones get messed up so quickly...It shuts down randomly...powers down on its own. I have picked it up to use and it was shut off, and It won't respond to using the power button. The battery has to be removed...you've got to pry off the back.What is hung up in memory that won't allow it to be powered back up? This is a huge flaw that hinders this phone's success. I am ""frankly"" amazed that we don't hear more about this. Then again, maybe I got one of the lemons? Buy one to play with they're cheap, and Verizon's version works well with Page Plus...what a great backup phone. I like mine! I just have to get better at removing the back.

mobile phone,First Smartphone,"D. J. Smith ""My life my books""",R2CJPE2TTHUJ6N,3,"This is my first smart phone, didn't know what to expect even after reading reviews, after setting up on Page Plus I couldn't figure what is so smart about it. There is no voice record on the phone (I like to have my nephew and niece sing and turn to ring tones) you can hook it up to PC and do it but that was on the first dumb phone I ever had. No back cursor for correction you have to tap and it can be hard to tap the spot. I like the feel of the phone the numbers are small but not a real problem the battery life is one day. I keep data off except for checking for pictures or sounds in texts,and set to be off when phone is in sleep mode. There are no notifications of Picture or voice text with data off. Some of the phone genius should come up with apps for these little things (that really aggravate me for some reason.) Everything that works on the phone works well so far, I have a lot to learn. Palm help is available on the phone and they do a great job with ""Live chat"" bet they get to know me. I am still torn if I want to keep this or go back to a feature phone type. I would recommend this phone for people that know more of what they can make it do. So many of the apps are for the 2.1 (or what ever the number is and not for 1.4? It has tried to freeze up a couple of times but came out OK. I guess if someone was learning on it it would have a chance or freezing up....lol.I do like the rubber feel back makes it feel safer in my hand, and the touch screen is easy maybe to sensitive. I want to love this phone in time maybe I will. Now to say a word about buying on here some sellers will raise and lower the price daily I had it in my cart to think about it and the price went up then when I went ahead and bought it that day the price came back down. Be aware of sellers, read their feedback, the phone did appear to be new as stated.","October 9, 2011",1
mobile phone,Bad Start,LAH,R3FSIYPVP878UB,3,"I first ordered this phone with BLUTEKUSA.COM INC; however, they sent me a phone that did not work. When you turned it on it would not go past the Palm logo. I had to return it. I decided to give the phone another chance, so I tried it out with the OEM Shop. This phone I received worked great. I just received it and am enjoying trying to figure it out. Playing with this one I realize that even though the box said Pixi Plus [and everything else on my order did too] I actually received a Pre. Blutekusa is not a company is plan on using ever again. Also, the one from OEM is great. If you're used to a touch screen with many widgets and an end key to easily cancel out, it will take some practice to get used to its design. There is no SD slot either. That bummed me out but I'm making due with my laptop and e-mail. Overall so far a pretty good phone, I like the Amazon music player.","September 28, 2011",1

mobile phone,"Good for email and text - anything else, well....",Brian M Marsh,R3EG462PHBKRAF,3,"This is an older model phone. With that comes some practical issues involving the purchase and installation of apps and games. The user forums were invaluable in helping getting this resolved and getting back on track. Once passed that hiccup you will find most apps are somewhat glitchy. Again, as an older model, it does not have a modern processor or even a removable memory card. The camera is passable. This device reminds me of the early BlackBerry products good for two things - email and text. The keyboard is nicely setup and is an absolute necessity with a phone this small. However, that's the upside. This phone is very small and disappears in a pocket unlike an iPhone or Galaxy. This has turned out to be a good starter phone for my young daughter as b it's built well and fits her smaller hand perfectly.","April 13, 2014",1

We mainly only use it for the hotspot. Times are changing though. The apps no longer install on Pixis. Once a factory reset is done, which needs done from time to time, they are gone and will not install. (We've tried this on more than one Pixi. Verizon has done all they can to help.) There isn't much for tech support with Palm products now. HP bought Palm, and we haven't been able to get any help with the problems. The hotspot works fine.

You might as well use the Verizon App Store. (ha ha ha)The interface is rather confusing (basically, swipe right to left as many times as you have to to get out of wherever you were, then throw away all the open windows toward the top of the screen, then click the Home button to start over)and it is not that good at automatically saving contacts or calling numbers from websites.Can't help comparing everything about it to an iPhone, to which it doesn't come close- but then again it costs a tenth as much, so what did you expect?

mobile phone,"Great, basic smartphone -- great price! But...",MrsCutesy,RTQ62KVQ62TL9,3,"This is a great little phone! I think it is more so for women than men because of its size so it is perfect for me. You may need to look at videos on YouTube to figure out how to use it if you are new to the Palm interface but once you figure it out it is easy to use and very convenient. This phone is NOT for power users -- stick with Blackberry or something like a Droid X or iPhone for this. This phone is not as fast and is great if you just need a great looking, easy to operate smartphone for light to intermediate use. This is mainly because of the processing speed. And I would strongly suggest that you get the charging docking station and the Touchstone back cover (to use with the charging station) because the wall charger compartment on the phone is made kind of funny and the plug comes out easily if you're like me and charge your phone up but still try to use it! Oh, the sound is GREAT -- I played a YT video on it and it sounded better than my husband's laptop speakers! And having owned an iPhone before, it easily tops their sound quality as well. All in all, great phone for a super cheap price -- all the booklets were included EXCEPT the manual (which you can find on the web anyway). You can use this phone with Page Plus Wireless too so my bill is only like $39.99 (or you can choose the $55 plan) and I still have the quality service that I would have with Verizon -- hooray for me --and hooray for you, too -- if go and buy this phone and use Page Plus -- double the savings!!!!UPDATE: 12.12.2012I have since purchased a new phone because I had android app withdrawal! Also, the back covers start coming apart pretty easily which means you would have to keep replacing them -- kind of annoying.

I bought a new one, hoping this new one would work like my Dads and husbands did. I haven't activated it yet. I bought this 'new'. It is NOT new. The stickers are all messed up. They look like a 4 year old put them on. I'm nervous to use it. I'm going to be unhappy to have just paid 70$ (again) for a crappy used phone.So, the phone itself is great if you get it NEW and it actually is new!","January 3, 2014",1

mobile phone,Just OK,MN Dude,R2KSDYWF49KBVZ,3,"I was paying $90 a month for a smartphone plan and a Moto Droid 1. Now I'm paying $25 a month for basically the same thing. Awesome. Now a little about the phone. My droid with a 14 month old battery would do standby with normal use for just over 2 days. This phone with a brand new battery and a full charge won't make it 2 days, if even a full day, with normal use no matter how many apps and functions are killed. It takes a good 2-3 hours to charge. The Droid took about an hour. The camera is mediocre with no flash but I guess it works. There is no notification LED which my Droid had so that is a definite minus. Kinda miss that. The phone functions much smoother than my Droid but chokes playing games. Angry Birds plays but eventually slows down to a crawl. Robo Defense and Solitaire play ok i guess. The call quality is on par with my Droid and possibly better. The built in wifi works better than the Droid. It's slightly smaller than my Droid which is good, but the phone seems a little on the light side and cheap. I was able to put the 16g micro sd card out of my Droid and transfer my phone numbers, music, etc. which was cool. The screen is low res by todays standard but functional. Makes reading web pages more difficult. I like the swype text entry and texting is no more difficult than the Droid. Calling to activate my phone and transfer my cell number was a bad experience. There was definitely a language barrier. The phone says Virgin Mobile so people will possibly make fun of you. All in all, I miss the notification LED, ability to play some games, the larger high res screen, longer lasting battery, and better camera. The phone is basically just good enough that any Android users will probably be able to use the phone and stay happy knowing they are saving big money every month.","June 1, 2011",1
mobile phone,Decent phone but has issues.,Christopher T Cruz,R1LLANURMHMG2G,3,"As one of the few remaining Americans that didn't own a cell phone, I finally broke down and became a Virgin Mobile customer because of their awesome prices for cell services. As for this LG Optimus V Android phone I have to say I've been disappointed with it's lack of internal phone memory and constant freezing up. It's not a horrible phone but due to the lack of phone memory I find myself having to limit the amount of apps I am able to store on the phone. Even with the 2gb removable memory card not every app can be ported to the card. This LG Optimus V also comes with a lot of bloatware that you can not remove from it and takes up a large portion of phone memory. It's a entry level Android phone but you will grow weary of uninstalling apps to allow the phone to run properly. The battery drains rather quickly and you will find yourself carrying around a charger with you almost everywhere you go. I would also recommend purchasing the car charger if you plan on using the Navigation app because the navigation drains the battery something fierce. Again, it's not a horrible phone but there are a lot better options that you can choose from. I would also purchase a new Micro SD card with more memory to replace the 2gb card it comes with. Personally I will be looking to upgrade this phone within the next 6-9 months but I'll be a Virgin Mobile customer for a long time coming.","May 6, 2012",1
mobile phone,Good gadget for the $,"Robert Eugene Reppert ""rrepster""",R38B0LXT649PF5,3,"The VM LG Optimus V is a FANTASTIC phone IF you live in 21st century civilization where Sprint coverage is plentiful - IOW major cities. Outside major cities though Sprint has ""partner"" agreements with other towers and thus you get dropped to 1x or worse. I however do most of my data use at home where I simply connect to house wifi then outside the house just use talk features.Overall, don't believe the coverage map, you have to test to find out if you'll get Sprint 3G in the areas you spend a lot of time and want the fast data access. Excellent GPS chip is built in which I use for geocaching.The physical phone is decent and speedy. There's phones out there with ""faster"" processes but this one has a dedicated GPU which balances that out. You will need the app ""app2sd"" so that you can run apps from the sd card because this phone has such a small amount of memory that it's a real stretch to call it a ""smartphone"".","November 4, 2011",1

mobile phone,"Not bad, IF you hack it",Mark Twain,RDBEQIWCN3CU0,3,"When I first got this phone I was really impressed with it, coming from a very cheap dumbphone. But after some time the flaws came up. This phone is very slow and often crashes or locks when doing any kind of multitasking. Sometimes the messaging app crashes. It's very slow to load webpages, even on wifi. Anything with more than a couple images and it would slow to a crawl. Also, there's a bug that unless you put your phone in airplane mode for 15sconds it would keep searching for a tower even with a good signal and drain the battery super fast. Not to mention that the screen is so tiny that it's hard to text and webpages are hard to read.However, if you root the phone and put cyanogen mod 7 on it and overclock the phone, it's much more usable. No more crashes or freezes, web pages load fast. You get a lot more internal memory since there's no bloatware. It doesn't overcome the hardware shortcomings of this phone, namely how small the screen is, but it's an improvement. I recommend if you buy this phone that you definitely root it and install custom rom.","January 5, 2012",1
mobile phone,My 1st Smartphone Is Showing Its Age,mvconsults,R3EP5W8L8RA0FI,3,"This was a revelation when I got this in March 2011 -- it was like having my laptop in my pocket -- everything worked terrifically, fast, etc., but now its pokey 600 mhz processor and other software/hardware shortcomings are becoming all too apparent.The ""Low on space"" notification comes on numerous times daily now. Came w/only 140 mb of memory and much of that is already taken up by various apps (not all can be moved over to the SD card) and phone software. The warning comes out when you dip below 18 mb and then you can't send out txt msgs until you clear out a few things. I'm not a big app person; move everything over to the SD card when possible but this phone has so little RAM it's pathetic.Only the Home and Back buttons work nowadays -- this condition mysteriously showed up about a year ago. I take good care of my phone btw -- keep it clean; periodic off/shutdowns; cycle out battery when things get slow. Don't want to try a hard reset yet because I'd have to re-download all my apps, etc.Hey, it's getting old. The screen's small so things are tougher to read. Battery barely lasts 12 hrs and I use JuiceDefender and usually have GPS off.The phone audio quality is good; for all its critics Virgin/Sprint's network operates well here. Camera quality is slightly above average in daylight; decidedly poor in concert/show/dark settings. 3.2 mp is bare minimum for well-lit shots; camera has a very slow shutter where there's a 1-2 second delay from when you press the shutter button and when the camera takes the pic, so your subject better not move until the shutter clicks.It was a good beginner phone but now I'm moving on to Virgin's HTC EVO 4G phone and will try to get at least 2 good years out of that. Technology changes quickly.","December 17, 2012",1

The gps and skype worked ok. It has a low resolution, small screen and not enough memory for applications. Internet browsing was slow and painful, therefore, I never used internet on it, usually skype if anything and gps sometimes.In Feb 2011 it was one of two I believe android devices on the prepaid market and probably the best phone in Feb of 2011 for Virgin Mobile prepaid plans, however , nowadays there are much better phones that you can choose from.The LG Optimus V is very basic and it is worth paying more for a better phone to be able to access the internet etc.Its functionality and speed are at the low end of the spectrum , basically an ancient device. I gave it 3 stars because it deserved 3 starts back then , in 2011( 3 years ago) but a lot has changed since then ....I highly recommend getting something better. I upgraded to the Samsung Galaxy S2 in Jan 2013 and even thought Galaxy s2 is also considered old by today's standards , it is a much better phone than the LG Optimus V and I am very happy I upgraded because I can do so much more with it.","November 26, 2013",1

mobile phone,It would be nice if they updated the software on it.,S. Hall,R2Y3U1O8BWM6D,3,"The phone hardware is pretty good. However, the version of Android that they have on it is older, and there is a newer version that other carriers have for the same phone that Version hasn't pushed out. The biggest problem you'll run into with it is that the version of Swype is old, and it has random words in its dictionary that if you hit them it will pop up a message sayig you found the magic word and how to handle it if you didn't want to. The only thing you can do at that point is exit the edit box and go back in. There isn't a way to turn it off without the upgrade.The battery life is pretty lousy. I can get about 30 hours out of it. But that seems to be pretty typical for non-Blackberry smart phones.I had Virgin Mobile years ago, and it was pretty useless in the Atlanta area (a lot of messages about the network being busy so I couldn't make calls). The service now is a lot better and I haven't had problems with it even when traveling.","January 22, 2012",1
mobile phone,Good phone but be careful of aftermarket headphones!,Santa Cruz Rich,R18CVXFWPVB09U,3,"I have been using this phone for about a month now. It is a solid, well working phone. I've had two issues with it, one of which is resolved and the other which is a potential unfixable flaw:1. initially my Gmail and Google calendar were working fine, but then fell out of sync. After playing around with the passwords and resetting a bunch of stuff, it finally started working again. Not sure if this was actually a phone issue or a Google issue.2. this one is definitely a phone issue: after-market headphones do not work well in this phone. The stock in-ear phones that came with it sound fine, but I've bought two different pairs of expensive, after-market in-ear phones and both sound tinny and faint - like they aren't connecting well. The only difference I can see is that the stock phones have 3 rings on the jack, whereas the after-market phones have two. My 'suspicion' is that Optimus has manufactured their phone to only work well with their own phones. If this is the case, then beware! If I had known this before I bought the phone I would have not bought it.UPDATE:date: December 2012. I've had this phone for over a year now. Still work solidly, and is rugged enough to keep on ticking after being dropped. My chief complaints are: as noted above, its hard / impossible to find non-LG earphones for it. And secondly, the virtual memory sucks - I am continually getting ""out of storage"" warnings whenever I try to load a new app or use a current one. I can see I have plenty of storage on the SD card, and all of the apps that I can move to the SD card have been moved there. It just doesn't seem to manage its memory very well. For this reason I will not buy another of these phones once I'm ready to change.","December 2, 2011",1
mobile phone,"Great plan, good cellphone, OK camera, poor smartphone",JK,R11V7W3ABO4K8D,3,"I got this phone while it was still on the $25/month rate (and still is, thanks, Virgin Mobile!). For unlimited data and more talk time than I'll ever use, it's a fantastic deal. Even at the current $35/month, you can't beat it, particularly since it's contract-free. The phone itself is OK. The cellphone part is good--conversations are clear, the speakerphone is loud enough. It's a good phone. The camera is pretty OK, good enough most of the time that I rarely wish I had my ""real"" camera with me. The real downside of this package is the smartphone part. Android 2.2 is pretty terrible on this phone. Laggy, fussy, clunky, crash-prone--it drives me crazy. It ignores more taps and swipes than it responds to, and then it often is lagging enough that it responds in the wrong way. The on-phone storage is tiny, so any apps that can't be installed on the storage card (and there are a lot of them) will use up that minuscule on-phone space. I have fewer than 50 apps--all under 10 MB each--installed, and have all of the ones installed on the storage card that can be, but I can't install any more apps because the on-board storage is completely full. Battery life is abysmal without running battery manager apps--and I don't like having to babysit my phone like that. (The ""Auto Airplane"" app is a godsend for this phone, though it trades functionality for good battery life. It turns off all the radios when you turn off the screen. The battery lasts for days as a result, but all the auto-notify and GPS features are turned off.) Also, this particular combination of phone and Android DOES NOT RUN FLASH. You need to install a third-party web browser that preprocesses Flash on a server, just like on an iPhone. I've become way too familiar with the ""Manage Apps"" screen and way too adept at pulling the battery out to ""fix"" yet another Android glitch. I tend to stick to a few relatively stable apps (Dolphin web browser, K9 email, Winamp) that aren't painfully laggy, counter-intuitive, or crash-prone. Which basically means that I use it like a featurephone instead of a smartphone. Overall, I think it's still a pretty good deal, even if Android isn't all it's reputed to be. Lesson learned.Virgin Mobile, if you read this, please bring out a real iPhone with this same prepaid deal. I'll buy it in a heartbeat.","October 22, 2011",1

mobile phone,The price was right...,Marty,R3FLNLT169LRFB,3,"First I'll start of with saying...I'm older and not as tech savvy as my kids when it comes to newer gadgets, but I try hard to get up to speed. This phone promised everything I was wanting in a new phone. However, when I started using it, found I had a few limitations. It won't send or receive pictures. So at a time when I'm working with three of my daughters to create a beautiful wedding for their sister...this just doesn't cut it. The only way I could get pictures sent out was to set up an email account, but how is that handy? My almost new son-in-law took my phone and installed an app killer that has nicely lengthened the time between chargings (GREAT asset). It may be more helpful for you to do this than putting the phone into airplane mode, as others have suggested. Being able to download apps (after a confusing update episode)has been very helpful. It's amazing what you can have on this phone that can help you in life AND have fun.I acquired this in a package deal that was less than anywhere else I was looking for just the phone, so I can't complain about not getting what I paid for. With luck, the issues I'm having are not just the phone. Hoping Virgin Mobile will be able to assist me in finding out why the picutres won't transmit or open. Basics are great. Finding a wifi spot to use the internet can be challenging, but other than the symantics of life, the purchase seems to have been worthwhile.","August 6, 2011",1

I have moved on to a Samsung Reverb. All my phones have been Virgin Mobile pay-as-you-go.

mobile phone,LG (sub)-Optimus V,G. Lutz,R3UTM9J9Y0S1AE,3,"The LG Optimus V is by all means, a perfectly reliable, albeit simple phone. To describe it in a single word, I'd call it ""adequate."" I enjoyed nearly everything about this phone, but its few minor and increasingly frustrating flaws have led me to quickly begin searching for a superior device.To begin with the positive, I loved the fact that the LGOV packs many of the features commonly sought after from modern smartphones in a sweet slim compact design, meaning you won't have to carry around a brick in your pocket just to check a Yelp review or write an email. In addition, the app suite available for download for the LGOV is almost as wide as for a brand new phone, but being that it is a slightly outdated phone (Android OS 2.2) several apps won't be available.That being said, while finding apps to use for your phone won't be difficult, operating them may be. This phone is somewhat slow, at least compared to newer models. This isn't a problem when you're calling or texting, but processor intensive functions cause noticeable lag - browsing the web or your photo gallery can be a chore sometimes, and you can forget about gaming on this phone.Another (last) major gripe about this phone is its embarrassingly tiny internal memory which can't handle downloading more than a handful of apps or in-text pictures from friends. I hated having to rummage through the memory to delete items to make room for new ones, and even though I have a microSD, not much can be ported over.Overall, for the purpose of making calls and sending texts regularly, this phone fits the bill if you want to save money. I loved that this phone was super cheap and it served most of my needs decently. My needs have since outgrown this phone's capabilities, but if yours remain basic, then this phone is reliable, sturdy and quite a deal.","December 26, 2012",1
mobile phone,Not really what I was looking for.,Angie,R1SA6LKL31OQRE,3,"The phone is a good entry-level smart phone and at the time that I purchased it, about 6 months ago, I was really happy to be able to afford a smart phone. But after a couple of months the sound stopped working and I couldn't set an alarm or hear a ringer. I am only able to be notified on a call by the vibration.","December 23, 2012",1
mobile phone,Good phone for someone not spoiled on higher end smartphones,GoodNoodle,R17F5061DMHPH8,3,"This is not a bad phone by any stretch. It's my very first ""smartphone"" type of phone, but I still found the learning curve to be very brief and I was master of my new phone in no time. I do the $35 monthly plan, which is fine for my needs. I don't talk on the phone much, but I like accessing the internet from time to time with wireless. I get good service, rarely drop a call, and all in all I'm pretty happy with it. I can, however, see some problems that a more savvy user would not tolerate. The wireless/internet I believe is 3G. It can be slower than molasses. You can watch Netflix and check facebook and such if you've got a good connection, but the average ""free"" wireless hotspot is not going to let you do anything without a fight. My second complaint is the battery life is really quite bad. It's not bad at ALL if you're just using it as a phone. It keeps its charge pretty well, and I've left it for a couple of days and it was still fine. The trouble comes when you do ANY sort of ""playing around"" on it. It drains that battery dry so quick, you don't even know what happened. You're in the green one minute, it's shutting itself down the next. There is also some glitching issues where a random sound will play on a loop constantly until I reset it. I believe it's a ""facebook pop"". It's only done this a couple of times, but I thought it was worth noting. All in all though, I'm happy with it. I would not recommend this for someone that is in love with their friends iphone, or other higher end device. I've had mine for about 6 months now, and I'll probably keep in another 6 months or so before I start looking into ""upgrading"" to something fancier. In short: Affordable phone, good service, easy to use....poor battery life, sometimes glitchy, and spotty wireless capabilities.","November 12, 2012",1
mobile phone,great low-end smartphone,emmanuel pascal,R2BB8MX1LG6PJ7,3,"first impressions: lightweight, feels slightly cheap but comfortable. android is smooth for this type of lower end smartphone (i am use to using android on high end tablets and media players).memory: memory is good considering i bought a 16GB micro-sd card days before the phone was delivered. unlike some reviews, i now have plenty of space for apps and music. a 16GB micro-sd card is a MUST.screen resolution: its nice and clear, nothing amazing like the higher end smartphones like the S3 or iphone.activation: i also got an error when i pressed the activation app, but i went to the official web page and it was a breeze.operation system (android): like i said, it is smooth even when the screen is packed with apps, the smaller screen is a Lil disadvantage and keyboard can be annoying since it is smaller. i think my 16GB sd card gave it that extra boost. i use to have a 2GB tablet, and it was horrible at loading/playing/storing apps since the storage was so so limited, sometimes unusable. so a SD card is a must. there is a slight lag when using the touch screen, which is expected.decent phone, and will update on status after having it for about 5 months.quick update: phone freezes up a lot, and it is now stuck on a black screen. i am waiting for it to completely discharge.UPDATE: love the phone, but it crashes randomly way too much for comfort. i had to take out the battery to make it snap out of the freezing black screen. i am still gonna keep the phone, and will update on status. UPDATE: the apps that come with the phone cannot be updated since internal memory is so low, the only apps that can be update are your new/personal apps you download fresh from google play, since those apps are stored into the SD card.i am gonna have to lower the score for this smartphone from a 4* to a 3*. the main reason for that is, the phone freezes too often and you can't update apps stored on the internal memory of the phone.the prime issue with this phone is STORAGE SPACE, there is barely any. even when you put a micro sd card you still have the problem of some apps not being able to be stored into the sd card memory space (not sure if there is a fix for this issue). i am lucky i have been blessed with a grateful spirit, i am grateful i even have a phone. if i was someone else i would had given this phone a 1 or 2 stars because of the storage issues.update: i managed to put some apps into the sd card. i have more space now. i recommend not downloading graphics heavy games, and only download apps that you must need.Bottom line: (07/27/2012) the phone is great, but storage is a issue for app heavy users, make sure you store most of your apps on the micro sd card, especially if you have a 16GB card and up. if you use a smartphone for games, movies, e-books, shopping or social networking, this phone would be good but you will have to risk not having enough space. just buy a high end smartphone if you plan to read a lot of e-books and see a lot of movies on your phone. get this phone if you are certain you aren't gonna use too much storage, and if you don't mind if the phone freezes often.update: (07/29/2012) i raised my score back to a 4*, because the phone performs really good despite the minor lags and crashes and poor battery life. web browsing is surprisingly really good, music is great, and apps run great (depending on graphics). overall great phone.update: (08/03/2012) the phone doesn't freeze anymore, but keep a watch on that memory. also some apps are not compatible with this phone. mostly graphic heavy apps.Final Update: (08/16/2012) the score has gone back to 3* since the limited memory has become a bigger issue now. you can't send or receive new text messages if memory runs low. i have to keep deleting apps. the phone also crashed at random times, but that does NOT annoy me at all, it is just the storage issue that bothers me a lot. i will stick with the phone for now. will upgrade to something with at least 8GB in the future. btw, the virgin mobile service is really good in my area.","July 25, 2012",1
mobile phone,If the in call sound weren't so awful it's be a 4.,Diamondbrite,RTYL3GIV22QGA,3,"As good as any other android 3g phone BUT:1. bad button placement- I find myself constantly raising and lowering volume because that is where my grip is when I hold the phone to press the top on/off switch to close the screen (rather than wait for the time-out).2. Power Control Widgit- the concept is great! However, despite the fact that I keep the bluetooth button lit, the phone doesn't automatically connect to my car (the mytouch did!)3. in-call sound is AWFUL!

mobile phone,"Good phone, mediocre customer service",Mr. Publius,RBVZ2DRIFCLZG,3,"I have the LG Optimus V. The phone itself is very good and I would rate the phone higher if official Netflix support was here now.Voice coverage is good where coverage is offered. It's too bad that the Sprint network, on which VM rides, doesn't have more coverage in the northwest.3G data coverage is spotty and doesn't always work indoors, but when it works, it works well.First, second and third-tier customer support are of questionable value. First- and second-tier appear to be ""follow the sun"" call centers around the world, while third-tier is based in North America. The people in third-tier are much more empowered to help, but they were still unable to get my service going in the first place. I had to approach fourth-tier support (executive escalations) to get my initial service configured and working correctly, including number porting. Lower tiers of customer service must be both trained and empowered to do more to satisfy customers. Asking customers repeatedly to reboot their phones or punch in a few numbers won't cut it when the problem is a broken database entry on the VM or Sprint end of things.Billing for phone insurance is perpetually broken and I am tempted to cancel it.Android 2.3 ""Gingerbread"" for the LG Optimus V should have been rolled out already, but hasn't been.The recent price increase, if it ends up affecting me as an existing customer, may drive me away. At the pricing as of August 2011, BeyondTalk is too expensive.Update: February 2013. I have departed Virgin Mobile for Ting. The customer service at Virgin Mobile is still unbearably bad and the telephone support personnel haven't been trained on the new billing system that replaced all account numbers, making it difficult to obtain correct data for number portability. Expect to have to send an EECB to get the process completed. Third-tier support appears to have been moved out of North America. The telephone numbers for escalation have been disconnected.I plan to keep the phone and use it for off-network purposes, running Cyanogenmod in order to have Gingerbread.","August 6, 2011",1
mobile phone,"Optimus V is pretty good --Virgin Mobile, not so much",Susan Sackett,RTUVU39C14M2D,3,"The Optimus V for Virgin Mobile is a decent Android Phone. Unfortunately, VM requires one of their unlimited plans, and will not let you use pay as you go. Why would you want a plan without data, you ask? Because the phone works great on WiFi, which my son has nearly everywhere he goes,and I could have saved a lot of money. He could have downloaded free games as well as paid games without the need for 3G. That said, VM is just trying to force you to a more lucrative plan. I am just waiting for Platinumtel to get a decent Android (The Sanyo they have is not very good), and then I'll switch him. Platinumtel does have the cheapest rates for pay as you go,and it allows Androids. If you are skimpy on 3G, their data is cheap too, and both ride on the Sprint network.Anyway, if you have the unlimited plan from VM, this is a good phone.","April 13, 2012",1
mobile phone,Great phone for the most part,Jake,R1YMJPRUL324XV,3,"This phone is amazing. The design, the screen, the camera. And also the feel of it. It was amazing. The reason I am giving 3 stars rather then 5 ids because one day I was using the video camera and the phone just froze. By the way this phone had no problems before. Well after it froze, I tried everything. Soft reset, hard reset and even took out the battery and charged it, but the phone does not turns on at all. And I mean nothing happens. So I called Samsung and guess what they said. The person who works there told me that the Samsung company in the U.S.A. does not fix international phones and that if I want it fixed I would have to call the company in China. So I decided to take it to a repair shop and they said the same thing. So yeah, great phone and all as long as it works. Once it stops working, its difficult to get it fixed. My advice buy the Galaxy S2, just not the international version.","August 15, 2012",1

With the wifi, bluetooth, and all other apps closed the battery maybe would last 4 hours. As I was using this phone's wifi instead of 4G, that was extremely useless. Also the signal strength was crap. I went back to an old Moto Razr (flip phone) and had 4 bars when this phone only had 1, if that. Notice that I am using past tense. I sold this phone and got a windows phone.","February 11, 2013",1

mobile phone,Samsung 3.2 mega junk,Frustrating Phone,R2ETMJAGDT3K37,3,"I have own this phone for over a year. At first it was a great phone, then after a few months. I started having issues with it. It would shut down on me at least 15 times a day. At lot of time I wasn't able to receive or send text, ( that on other hand might have been the Virgin Mobile carrier). When ppl would send me Pictures I wouldn't receive them until maybe three day later or never. Also, times I couldn't even answer the calls, when I try to answer calls the phone would just shut down. Some days I just wanted to smash it to the floor. But I must admit it had a lot of free apps on it. It easy to work, some features that even an IPone didn't have. Would I purchase it again. Maybe, then again Maybe NOT!!","May 3, 2013",1
mobile phone,Yes and No,William Bernstein,R3SC4SJWSVPKLT,3,"On the plus side, the price is right for both the phone and the service: unlimited data, texting, and 300 minutes for $25 per month.On the minus side, Virgin Mobile's support is nonexistent, and the coverage is spotty outside major urban areas.In addition, if you're running Android 2.1, the device is maddeningly slow and balky; 2.2 is a must. Upgrading the OS is relatively easy to do on your own--there's a Youtube video that details the process, though it's not for beginners. If you can't hack that, then I'd be sure to buy one with 2.2 preinstalled.Conclusion: not a bad bargain for very light web browsing, especially if texting is important to you. But I certainly would not recommend this as a primary web access device.","July 13, 2011",1
mobile phone,"Good Phone, Not Enough Memory","Norma Beishir ""author, The Unicorn's Daughter""",R2ODREL748SKTO,3,"I wanted an Intercept because my son has one and loves it. He got me one as a Christmas gift. The first few months were sheer frustration--it would freeze up, apps wouldn't open, I couldn't answer phone calls, and the battery would drain within a few hours.I'm not one to keep trading phones, so I stuck it out. I bought some extra batteries from a seller here on Amazon (got them cheap), and just change them when necessary. Oddly enough, the battery time is much better per battery than it was in the beginning. I'm not sure why, but I now get a full day out of one battery. Go figure. It doesn't lock me out as often, and works quite well for what I need it to do.My biggest complaint now is that there's not enough memory. I put a 16GB SD card in it. Supposedly, most apps will save to the card. If that's the case, why is so much space used up on the phone's memory? It only has 184MB to start with. Even that would be enough for me if I could unload the pre-installed apps I don't use.Note to manufacturers: don't stick us with apps we don't use/want!","June 12, 2012",1

The day I got the phone we ran to and fro trying to get it activated. Once we finally activated it I downloaded apps and what not. The next day it wanted me to activate it again. This happened for a couple days. I ended up factory restarting it and starting at the beginning. The cameras quality is no where near my expectations and it's rather slow. It isn't bulky, fits right in my pocket, and gets great service.

mobile phone,If only it had reception,bella,R1RWL3NTX8DCPJ,3,"This is a great phone if only it had reception. I've had VM service for years and have never had a problem receiving a signal. I get two out of four bars if I'm lucky which is plenty of signal for the phone to function well, but I rarely get two bars. If I'm at work, which is right in the middle of a major metropolitan area, I often lose the signal all together. The guy who sits next to me at work has sprint (same network as VM) and he has no problem ever getting reception. I know this because he streams Pandora every day, all day. Like the other reviews said, this phone just doesn't have adequate reception. When it does work, it's a great phone. It's super fast and the big screen makes it easy to use. I suggest if you want to try this phone, buy it from a store with a 30 day return policy so if you get bad reception you can take it back. Mine's going back as soon as I get another phone. I have to be able to rely on my phone and know it's getting the signal when I'm in the network area.","March 2, 2012",1

mobile phone,Good phone that needs improvements,Amazon Customer,RS3MZ425R6QE5,3,"Overall I like this phone. Being one of the first Android phones for the prepaid market I can understand that it is going to lag behind its contract phone competitors. I like the the Android OS that came prepackaged and the 3g coverage in my area is nice. I like being able to watch Netflix movies or listen to radio.com. Certainly the OS could be improved, but it's still nice out of the box. As for service, that depends on where I am. Frankly anyone getting any cell phone should check the coverage area and ask around before spending the money. I have noticed that sometimes the buttons do not respond. I assume this is because there are too many programs running in the background. I am constantly shutting them off, but they find a way to restart themselves! Another issue that I have is with the placement of the camera button and the use of a touchscreen button at that! For those that don't have this phone, the camera button (when you select the camera option) comes up at the bottom of the screen along with several other buttons for options. Now, this camera takes decent mobile photos for a camera in its price range, but I find the location of button very awkward. It is hard to get a stable image when you are both trying to press a touch screen button and stabilize the phone as well. I think a better option would have been an actual button on the top sides of the body. Also the location of the end call touch screen button makes it easy to accidentally hang up with your cheek. Finally, although I find the media volume to be quite high enough, the volume during calls is rather low. I have also had random incidences in which all I hear is muffled static despite having at least 3 bars or more.","February 4, 2012",1
mobile phone,"Nice, zippy phone but poor reception",markbyte,R30FI3G36PFEG1,3,If this phone got good reception it would be absolutely perfect. I will be keeping it (if that tells you anything) but its biggest weakness is the reception. If you are on the outskirts of town the phone piece will work but forget getting any data coverage. My old phone showed about 3 bars inside my house (my old phone was the Optimus V). This phone shows 0 to 1 bar inside the same house. If you live in a well-covered city you'll love the phone. If you live on the outskirts of town then you might want to consider the Optimus V instead.,"December 26, 2011",1
mobile phone,Has some problems but its still the best prepaid smartphone.,Phil & Flora,R369QEQ56KWTS4,3,This phone has a problem keeping the connection with bluetooth devices. I drive for a living and that's a big problem. It will often disconnect from my in-dash bluetooth connection after a call is finished. I also use this phone to stream podcasts while i drive and it works well but having to go into the settings and reconnect the bluetooth is annoying. The phone also momentarily freezes sometimes. If your a heavy user you will probably burn your battery out fast. With that said it's still the best prepaid phone i have ever had and I learned to love it. I don't plan on getting a new one any time soon.,"January 12, 2012",1
mobile phone,"5 stars for value, 3 for performance, 1 for bugs",Marcus T. Brody,R3CPQE4DJA2Z43,3,"After losing my job, I needed to cut costs. I have become very reliant on having a smartphone, after having 3 different BlackBerry's and an iPhone. But I needed to chop that $125 a month down significantly. I researched options, and saw that Virgin Mobile offered a pretty modern Android phone for $55 per month, unlimited everything. I did my research, read reviews, and decided that I'd take the plunge. I cancelled my AT&T; contract, sold my iPhone on eBay, and I was set up with Virgin Mobile and the Motorola Triumph.After 3 months, I can say, that this is a very serviceable phone. It does everything I need it to, and it's very reliable, for the most part. The phone DOES have a lot of different bugs and quirks, but I can deal with them, if it saves me $70 per month. This is certainly no iPhone, but it does the job. I can surf the web pretty darn quickly, the apps in the Android Markerplace are ok (not nearly as good as Apple though), and my texts and calls are pretty reliable. The sprint network, which is what I'm connected to, isn't bad. It's not as good as AT&T; was, but isn't as bad as T-Mobile. It's somewhere inbetween, and like I said, it's serviceable.The phone has a lot of bugs and quirks, like I said. The GPS is horrible. I downloaded ""GPS Fix"" apps to try to remedy the problem, and it still stinks. The GPS cuts out often, and sometimes can take as much as 2-5 minutes to connect. I used my BlackBerry and iPhones as a driving GPS, but can't really do it that well with this phone, which kind of stinks. This phone also freezes a lot. Not for long, but it's still kind of annoying. It also just randomly shuts off and restarts a few times a week as well. All of sudden out of nowhere the phones says ""VIRGIN MOBILE!"" and shuts off, then says it again when it starts back up.It's pretty embarrassing having a Virgin Mobile phone, so I got a phone case, which covers the Virgin Mobile logo. I say it's embarrassing, because I'm a person who has made a six-figure income, drive a $60,000 car, yet I can't even afford my freaking iPhone anymore because of this awful economy! Thankfully my $60,000 car is paid off. I've toyed with selling it, but it's de-valued so much, that I might as well keep one nice thing!The camera on this phone is pretty good. 5.0 megapixel. The video claims to be 720p, but I beg to differ. I have taken quite a number of videos on different settings, and the video camera is horrific. It's no better than the video I used to take on my BlackBerry Curve, when that was a popular phone back about 4-5 years ago. I do have a Video Camera that shoots in 1080, so I'm not too concerned with the video camera, although it would be nice if it were better.The battery life on this phone is EASILY the worst I've ever seen for any smartphone I've ever been aware of. Be prepared to buy chargers for your car, work, and use the one that comes with the phone for home. You'll easily need 3 chargers to maintain proper battery levels, because this phone SUCKS up the juice like nothing I've ever seen. I've downloaded all kinds of ""battery fix"" apps, but all they do is shut turn off internet and GPS when you're not using it, so it has to constantly re-connect when you need it. Sure, you can get better battery life, but it makes the phone perform worse.All in all, this is a very good phone for someone on a budget. $55 per month plus tax, I think it's like $59 or something per month, all inclusive. I use the word ""serviceable"" for this phone, because it does a serviceable job at replacing the high end phones like a BlackBerry or iPhone. It will never be an upgrade for those phones, but it pretty much does what they do. Not as well, but not that far behind. It's a good value on a shoestring budget, if you must have a smartphone, like I must.","October 14, 2011",1

mobile phone,"Better Performance Than Optimus V, But More Bugs",Rahimi,R2BYZQ1MRSFVEW,3,"I'll start like this: Don't buy this phone unless you are willing to take a few extra steps. These steps mainly include rooting and installing custom ROMs both of which the average user is unwilling (voids warranty) or unable to do. The main strength of this phone is a decent Android experience with no contract commitment. (It is not worth full MSRP, though. I would recommend the Galaxy S II 4G if you're looking at that price range.)I bought my phone new in July 2011. I was pleased having upgraded from an Optimus V. Out of the box, this phone runs stock Android 2.2 aka ""Froyo"". There is some bloatware that cannot be removed without rooting your phone, but the OS is stock Android otherwise. The stock experience on this feels much more responsive than the Optimus. Everything is faster. The browser, apps, and games all launch more quickly and play more smoothly.The trade off for the performance is battery life. I was getting about 15 hours on a single charge with 3G enabled. That time was drastically reduced if I played any games or turned on Wi-Fi. I keep GPS off at all times unless I need it for Google Maps. The phone takes anywhere from 10 to 45 seconds reacquiring signal from the satellites and fixing your position. This is longer than my old phone.Cell and 3G coverage will vary from location to location. If you have Sprint coverage in your area, VM service should be available as well. Call quality is the same as it was when I had Sprint. I've had a single dropped call; However, I don't talk on the phone too often. The 3G speeds are adequate enough for me to stream Pandora while driving.I've dropped the phone several times. There is a single small scratch (1/4"") in the upper left corner that is noticeable only when light hits it at just the right angle. The rest of the phone's casing shows no evidence of damage. It's holding up extremely well.Pros:4.1"" Screen1 GHz Snapdragon single core CPUGorilla GlassDurabilityHDMI out*""Unlimited"" text and data$35/moCons:Unsatisfactory performance during HD video playbackRear camera is useless indoorsBack key doesn't work occasionally (eventually fixes itself)Loss of volume on headphone jack after a notification (fix by pausing for 10 seconds and unpause or silence all notifications)Bloatware runs in background reducing battery life*GPS occasionally takes long time to lock on**These issues are resolved with custom ROMs, but you lose HDMI functionality after installing some ROMs.","December 14, 2012",1
mobile phone,Great upgrade from Rumour Touch to Android-update :-(,John A. Lucier,R2T9NANWOR0E8P,3,"This is my first Android and my fourth VM prepaid phone, I had the Rumour Touch for 8 months prior.Observations, and I'm in the coastal area of San Diego (ocean beach) for those concerned with reception:Phone is very well made, feels solid and chunky but not heavy. Nice soft rubbery case, according to Dow Corning this has their Gorilla Glass anti-scratch glass screen. I must criticize the battery door, it seems to not be real secure and like another reviewer mine fell off after a drop- mine just 2 feet onto linoleum covered concrete. Phone didn't skip a beat and door is fine, but I think if gets bent or tweeked a bit it would be an issue. I have some domestic skills and came right home and made a well fitting vinyl case, double thick, so hopefully the next drop will be in it.Activation or swapping phones was a breeze, I sent my contacts from the Rumour to the Triumph via bluetooth. Virgin had it activated on the second try, which is pretty good. Phone is intuitive, I read the directions for about 1 minute and haven't needed them since.Reception.... I'm on the coast on a hilly peninsula, receiving FM radio stations other than those on the coast has always been hard, the graph on this phone is usually pegged at 1-2 bars inside, 3 outside. It does seem to affect the phone's performance at 1 bar- browsing the android market or sending messages seem a little bogged down. 2 bars, not noticeable. I can improve from 1 to 2 by simply moving around and if I go to another room 3 bars is possible. Overall I can't say it's a big deal, and the Rumour never had a bar meter so who knows if it wasn't the same. However I can see how some may have issues with it. I think it depends on your area, and the phone's reception is not defective but not top of class either.Here is a caveat to this as a complaint: As cell phones transmit their location to towers as they receive, and of course when transmitting, it is possible that reception issues inherent to this phone may have little to do with a bad antenna design and instead that the Triumph had less transmitting power back to the tower. Unless you've been hiding under a rock, you know the jury is still out on safe SAR and biological effects of RF energy. This could well be a blessing- provided you can still use it as a phone, and not a brick. I'm speculating of course but it could be the case.Battery life is not so great but I'm comparing this to the Rumour which is apples to oranges. This will run down its battery pronto (like overnight) if you leave some apps running and forget about it. As a phone and texting machine I will say I kind of miss my Rumour's physical kbd and gawdawful loud speakerphone. A few times when the background noise was sufficient the speakerphone on the Triumph was a no go, had to kill speaker to complete the conversation. I don't miss the way the Rumour seemed to hang up every call as I tried to unlock it, and its horrible touch screen.Overall I'm happy with my purchase and VM is tops in my book, I kept my $25/mo plan, that alone has my friends with iphones finally jealous with envy, as much as I was at their hardware. (though I discover the game apps are still far below theirs-the drag racing game is so dumb, why am I so addicted to it?) As for apps they are great, my non android friends are most impressed with Google Sky Map- hold your Triumph up to the night sky and sight up any star or planet, and there you go. I will give the Triumph four stars for its relatively minor flaws, let's face it, five should be perfection or it's diluted.Updating this. After a couple of months living with this I have a couple of gripes. The reception is spotty still. The touchscreen well sometimes it's buggy as hell, have to touch your selection up to ten times (really!) other times it seems to select everything in a list above and below it EXCEPT what you select, over and over, it's like fighting the phone to get it to do what you want. Speakerphone is as good as useless. And the really major annoyance is alerts only sound once and you can't program them to repeat. So if you got a text and did't hear it the first time, tough luck. These flaws do make it easy to not love. Some good: It's pretty durable, the voice recognition works really well. Three stars.","August 7, 2011",1
mobile phone,The best prepaid phone,Hoper,R1BF0WIRVGLCLI,3,I don't like Virgin mobile but this phone is the best prepaid phone for the company. I guess it's worth the $220 I paid for it...but it's NO iPhone lol smh!!!,"October 31, 2012",1
mobile phone,Decent overall,MichaelBoerman,R2BA04LA2PRDPW,3,"Let's cut strait to the chase: I bought this 2 days after it came out from a sketchy eBay store with poor english because I wanted to save $50. Looking back, it wasn't the best choice, because I had to enter every number under the sun to get it to register. I'd get it from Amazon now, but it wasn't on here back then.For being one of the first Android phones to hit the prepaid market, it's great. But now that they announced the HTC EVO V4G phone, Im going to upgrade. HTC is, in my opinion, superior to Motorola in many ways. Motorola phones break. A lot. They always shut down, don't start up, screen will go awry, keyboard will stop working, etc., and it never ends. Mine got stuck in a continual boot cycle (Motorola's bios, not the Android/VM one) and I had to send it in. Then they said they didn't get the old one back, so my new one shut off. Long story short, hundreds of minutes were wasted on tech support. Oh well, it's all past and done now.If you get it, you have to peel off the screen protector that comes with it. It makes it so much more vivid, saturated, responsive, and brighter. I don't think it voids the warranty.BUT. I wouldn't get this phone any more. I mean, one for ~$50 more is coming out in 2 weeks with 3D, 4G, and OS4.0/ Ice Cream Sandwich. The Triumph has never gotten a software update.","May 9, 2012",1

mobile phone,Solid phone that needs a bigger battery,Dave A.,RBOD6O0T2M3LT,3,"I've used an unlocked HSPA+ Galaxy Nexus for a month. Overall, it's a very good phone. Having switched from a Blackberry (RIP!) this is my first Android phone so I can't compare it to other Android phones. It is thin, light and feels comfortable in my hand. However, it is a large phone and probably feels comfortable in my hand because I wear men's XL gloves.The screen is fine but not outstanding except maybe in ideal light. I've seen other phones with sharper screens including iPhones. I believe this phone uses a Pen Tile display and that type of display has been criticized for a lack of sharpness.The phone is fast and lags are not a problem. Some of that may be due to Jelly Bean, see below. HSPA+ seems to deliver data quickly. I understand that LTE is faster but this phone is plenty fast enough for me.Sound quality with calls is good. Pairing with my Blue Ant was no problem.The camera is relatively good but I've seen better pictures from other phones.The major drawback with this phone is it's battery life. It can make it morning to night only with very light usage. To preserve battery life I find myself turning off wifi, bluetooth and GPS if I am not using them. Fortunately, the operating system provides an easy widget to do this but it's still a pain and even then I have days where I have to recharge. The GPS in particular seems to consume power. To compensate I have USB charging cables in my car and briefcase and at my desk. I understand that LTE tends to use more power than HSPA+ and if that's true I would avoid this phone unless they have compensated somehow. This is a pretty good phone but it's of little use dead. I'd much prefer a somewhat thicker and heavier phone that relieves me of power management.One of the biggest benefits of buying an unlocked phone is that right after I started it up I received the upgrade from Android 4.0 (ICS I think) to 4.1 (Jelly Bean). The geek news regularly reports that users with locked Android phones must wait or do without Android upgrades. Bypassing carrier controls for operating system upgrades is a luxury usually reserved for iPhone users. Jelly Bean is supposed to be smoother and faster and that may be why this phone doesn't lag. If so, then unlocked is definitely the way to go.Another obvious benefit to buying an unlocked phone is the lack of a contract. I paid 349 for the phone which is a very low price for a phone barely off the cutting edge. I'll make up the premium I paid over a comparable phone had I bought it on contract in less than a year and then I'll be free to move to another device if I want.This phone would be a 5 if it had better battery life and a better screen.","August 27, 2012",1
mobile phone,Good phone. But may be international version! (not standard),Johnny,R2H7LS08A7QBUG,3,"I just recently received my Samsung Galaxy Nexus phone and found that it was not the standard build. The phone came with an international charging unit (most likely European) and so I was not able to plug it in a normal outlet. The other thing is that it's NOT running under Google's hardware in which you can have instantaneous over-the-air updates from Google. So I was unable to update my phone to the current Jelly Bean Android software without having to install a separate rom or flashing my phone to a stock-built hardware version. I am very technical when it comes to updating phones and do not want to brick or harm my phone in any way by doing something else to get the update when it should come standard with the phone in the first place. I went ahead and returned this phone from Amazon and bought the Galaxy Nexus directly from the Google play store. It comes preloaded with the latest Jelly Bean software and you have a more peace of mind with it's current hardware and software updating. Not to mention it's cheaper than Amazon's price. I would recommend buying it directly from Google. These are the only reasons why I'm giving it 3 stars. Other than that it is a really lightweight, sleek, and fabulous phone and I am really loving it's functionality and performance.","September 17, 2012",1

mobile phone,"Lots of pros, a few strong cons.",V. Schuman,R3ND2ZIVW06G0K,3,"I've had it for a little over a year now and am about to replace it because it's dying. But let's start with the good.Pros:- Great size screen. Not too large, not too small, just right.- Looks great, especially without the protective cover.- Very responsive, fast.- No software skins/addons by carriers, just straight awesome android.- Good sound, loud and clear.- Standard micro-usb port for charging- Really strong glass, no scratches or anything after falling on the pavement a couple of times.- Camera shutter lag almost doesn't exist, very quick.Cons:- Screen acquired burnout lines at the top & bottom after a few months.- Battery life is so-so. Definitely needs to be recharged every day, and if actively used, way before the day is over.- Camera quality is pretty bad, especially in low light.- I took it on skiing trips twice. No falls or anything. The phone was inside my jacket all the time. After the first ski trip (temps around 32F) it started acting a bit weird, showing the wrong battery level and discharging very quickly. The issue seemed to go away the following day. After the second trip (temps around 21F) it went completely nuts. It shows that it's charging most of the time (even when it's not), often it starts jumping between showing that it's charging and that it's not, which turns on the screen all the time. I turn off the screen, and a moment later it turns it back on until I either turn it off or put it on the charger. Today it also started making weird sounds every once in a while. Maybe the phone is ok and it's just the battery, or maybe it's the phone. Either way, the ski trips did it in. I'm replacing it, but I'd be curious to know if anyone else experienced similar issues with this or other phones.It was still a good phone while it lasted. And if I knew what I know now and had to get a phone a year ago, I still would have probably gotten this phone.","February 20, 2013",1

mobile phone,"Phone great, but custom firmware",Oana,RZJBFC8G1KPQ5,3,"So I bought this phone more than a year ago as a present for my boyfriend. All was great, until I got the same phone, but directly from google. My phone updated nicely to jelly bean while this one didn't. So I finally decided to contact samsung about it, and it seems that this kind of phones do not get updates from Samsung yet. But this phone got notifications about a system update, so after some research I downloaded an app that told me that the phone has a ""yakjuxe"" ROM, which seems to be a custom one and can't be updated (or at least those were the complaints on different forums). Now I have to find a good guide that tells me how to update to a google updatable ROM and hope I don't brick it.","August 27, 2013",1

mobile phone,Galaxy Nexus reviewed,Mikkel Grum,R2PP1PE9JFUVI4,3,"Overall, the Samsung Galaxy Nexus has a nice feel to it. I like the curved glass; it just feels right when you're talking on the phone. The body is thin and although a bit plasticky, it still feels elegant. Open up the device and it still looks great. The screen is great.Android 4.0 has a number of neat features. I particularly like the task switcher (although it's a bit sluggish) and a lot of other things have just been thought through. However, the dark theme seems musky to me, and masculine in a way that I don't connect with. Now, dark colours save on battery life fi you have an AMOLED screen, so my complaint is not about the darkness per se, but the overall feel and colour combination. I'm not sure I like the new Roboto font either, there's something inconsistent about it.Despite a few negative comments, I would love the phone if it wasn't for the anemic battery they've put in it. Why is the only phone on the market with a half decent battery a CDMA phone? Why are we forced to use our smartphones like they were feature phones if we want to be sure to make that last urgent call late in the day? Makes me feel like the smartphone has yet to be invented.","February 27, 2012",1
mobile phone,Works great excepting for texting,Michelle Benedetti,R9Q82TF0NZ1YP,3,"I got this phone about three weeks ago to replace my LG Optimus T. I liked the Optimus T, but felt it was a little laggy when running apps and the screen was smaller than I really wanted. This phone initially seemed perfect: bigger screen, bigger memory, better camera. All of that is true and I really enjoy all of those aspects of the phone.My biggest complaint is the text messaging. The phone, out of box, has some pretty bad texting problems that can be found across the t-mobile board (wish I had seen those earlier!). Messages fail constantly; some messages that fail have more than 160 characters, other are short messages. It took me five minutes to get an ""Ok!"" sent to one of my employees. If this problem didn't exist, this phone would be a 4-star for me, but both Samsung and T-Mobile support don't seem to want to do anything about this problem.","March 21, 2012",1
mobile phone,This Android Smart Phone Is A-M-A-Z-I-N-G ! ! ! ! !,Online Junkie,R21IQJEMMD36GM,3,"I love this phone! There's so many reasons why this is such a great phone, here's a few off the top of my head...1. Low price for an unlocked full featured phone (have to wait 60 days to unlock free)2. Large User base and developer/hacker base. Plenty of Samsung Exhibit II user forums to get most of your newbie questions answered3. Lots of inexpensive accessories/batteries/cases. I paid $13 for a bundle that included 2 batteries/charger/gel case/screen protector4. Lots of useful info by other owners/users if you read the reviews here5. Great multimedia Android phone. I just finished watching the latest Transformers movie on the phone with Netflix!6. Excellent T-Mobile 4G network7. Excellent, inexpensive prepaid plans. I pay only $30 per month using the Walmart 100 min/unlimited data/text plan8. Turn your phone into a wireless hotspot for only $15/month and run your laptop and up to 5 wifi devices using your phone as a wifi hotspot.9. Use your Gmail and Google Calendar and Google Maps10. Great GPS functions and mapping11. Facebook, Meetup.com, Metro.net etc. most of the websites that I frequent have apps available12. microSDHC slot to add up to 32gb of memory13. Camera, voice/audio recorder14. Free wifi calling using Google Voice and GrooveIP. Takes a little messing around but once you get it, you'll love it and not use up your 100 minutes. Buy the$5.00 full version of GrooveIP and don't bother with the free/crippled version.14. Plenty of hacks to root this phone and get rid of bloatwareI bought this phone from Amazon and use the Walmart/Tmobile $30 prepaid plan giving me unlimited data/texting and 100 minutes of voice calls. But with the FREE WiFi calling (see #14) I use less than 50 minutes a month as I'm always around a wifi network. If I manage to exceed the 100 minutes, I pay 10 cents a minute... big deal... Later this month, I'm gonna try using the phone as a wifi hotspot ($15/mo) and if it works well at home, I'll dump my cable service that I pay $136/month for cable internet and tv!Just re-upped with Netflix for $8/month for unlimited instant videos as they've added a lot of movies to their catalog and don't bother with the mail in DVD's anymore... Although I did just buy a Blu-Ray player... The Netflix movies play great... well, I was using my cable/wifi connection to watch a movie. I haven't tried watching a video on just the 4G connection yet.Oh, I live at the bottom of a canyon in the Hollywood Hills and most of the other service providers I would not get any reception but with T-Mobile I get a solid 3-4 bars!Cons:1. Battery life is not too long if you are a heavy web user. But buy a couple of spare batteries ($7ea) and no problemo...2. Phone is small and slippery standard, so get the gel case and that will fix the problem and protect the phone3. Seems I can't view my Amazon Prime free videos on the phone. But maybe it's possible and I just haven't figured it out yet...Yeah, I'm a huge fan... this is a great deal for the phone and low monthly cost for a prepaid/no contract unlocked phone.UPDATE 9-2013: I suppose I've downloaded too many apps. My web browsing and operation of the phone has slowed considerably. I am now planning to root my phone and remove all apps that are bloatware and not needed. Thus at this time, I'm down grading this review from 5 stars to 3 stars. This is a single core processor, so my next phone will most likely be a quad core or no less than a dual core processor. If after I root the phone and it enhances the performance back to acceptable levels, I'd bump the rating back up. zxcvb","August 4, 2012",1
mobile phone,"Good, cheap phone","Amazon Customer ""waxaw""",R25L4U878CVTSP,3,"I got this phone a few months ago because I've started using Google Docs and the screen on my previous phone (comet) was too small to use it comfortably. I'm happy with the screen on the phone. It's fast enough to play some games. Angry Birds is laggy on most levels, but playable. I have the Kindle app and find it's comfortable to read on as well if I don't have my Kindle on me.Things I don't like about the phone:1. There is NO alert/notification LED. This is the biggest deficiency. Have to activate the screen to see if I have any notifications.2. There is no auto-adjust option for screen brightness.3. The phone beeps (or vibrates when on vibrate) when it's fully charged. Who ever thought it would be a good idea to have your phone wake you up in the middle of the night when it's charged??4. Phone has a lot of bloat ware. I really need to get around to rooting and deleting the stuff that's not needed.5. A minor annoyance, but it's difficult to tell which end of the phone is which by feel and the volume button is on the opposite side as the power button so I find myself often pressing the volume by mistake when I want to hit the power button.6. I wasn't able to get tethering to work. Not sure if it's my plan or something else, but can tether on my old phone with the same SIM card.7. No Ice Cream SandwichThings I like about the phone:1. Memory is more than adequate for my needs. I'll need to add a microSD card eventually, but haven't needed to yet.2. Screen size and quality3. It's adequately fast4. It's cheap5. Camera has a flash6. 4g (HSPA+)I'm still happy I got this phone, since I'm rather frugal and I wouldn't want to spend twice as much money to get a phone that only takes care of a few more of my disappointments.","March 29, 2012",1
mobile phone,Develops battery problem after a year!!!,Duduyemi,R35DCOX32QLE06,3,"I bought this phone about a year and a half ago. I recommended this phone to a couple of family members who bought them almost at the same time frame I bought mine. I am not a paid promoter. I just love samsung products for their durability. After a year of using this phone, the phone developed what I think is battery problem. I would fully charge it and would make or receive a call and the phone would go completely dead. I bought a new battery and the phone works but would sometime hang and I would have to remove the battery and put it back, then turn it on before it works. The other family members also have the same problem and had to change their phone batteries almost at the same time. Is this phone programmed to develop a problem after a year? Does this phone have an expiration date? I know some phones do. All in all, it has served me well as I enjoyed using it when it worked perfectly well.","January 3, 2014",1

mobile phone,"Not Great, but Best of Budget Smartphones",Marcus Harmon,RRAWPQ5EUZ8DO,3,"Today, the popularity of smartphones has increased. Everyone who has not had a smartphone will be searching for a decent one or those on a low budget wants one. Samsung Exhibit II is the best smartphone out of other prepaid smartphones. In other words, it is good of prepaid smartphones but not that good in the smartphone market overall.First, the phone is good if you would like to have easy and accessible communication. You can call, text, e-mail, and use apps to communicate such as Facebook and other social apps. Setting up e-mail can be difficult if you are using a system like Microsoft Exchange. But once you figure it out, it works great. Also, there is a decent camera. The picture is great and videos appear pretty darn good for a budget smartphone. There is a camera in the from to for self portraits (but low quality). For basic communication, it is okay.On the downside, you probably won't be able to get the best experience from a smartphone. If you like downloading various apps and using them, the phone will become kind of sluggish. One disappoint is the Maps. Maps is not accurate enough. If you are searching for a location, do it before you drive. I would not recommend driving and following navigation because it GPS does not respond at the speed you drive. Also, I recommend getting an external memory (i.e.: MicroSD). The memory will fill up before you know it if you use music apps like Google Music/Play. If you do not know, a great deal of 4G smartphones get warm after using it for a while. Do not blame the manufacture because of this one negative aspect. Otherwise, this phone is not for excessive use, but it can get by.Overall, this phone is great for those who never had a smartphone that has not been made in the past several years(including the BlackBerry). If you are looking for a better smartphone than your current one, test this phone to it's fullest capabilities to make sure it is right for you.","March 30, 2012",1
mobile phone,Worth it - but becoming skeptical on stability,Sashidharan V,R37F0XJI8B8WTC,3,"It's yet another product I would say worth for the amount. I am forced to give 4 stars*, just because of the bloatware loaded on to the device. The look is great and it's not heavy. The Android OS interface is so cool. Battery life is average. (lasts as good as 24 hours with a very basic usage (calls, data and sync emails) and about 12 hours with extensive usage (wifi, gps etc.,). The screen size is the biggest advantage. The camera is really nice (I am wondering on critical reviews on camera). The front camera is just a VGA, still good for video chatting using skype. (not sure whether a skype or Android's bug not detecting the headset during answering skype calls - not a big deal though, just unplug and plug back the audio jack). A good phone if you are a beginner to use smart phones.This is technically the 2nd phone I received with the same order, as the first one's audio jack wasn't giving sound on both sides. Thanks to Amazon, as they replaced a new phone the very next day.Update 1 : Just noticed that, whenever there is no actual 4G coverage (though the network shows as 4G), the speed drops to EDGE instead of 3G. Not sure if this is phone's problem or T-Mobile's.Update 2: After 4 weeks I found couple of weird things. The mobile restarted itself 2 times while I was on a call. Once opening the camera makes the display to look green (like a garbled image) and the phone hung , so have to remove battery and power it on to make it work.*So I am now forced to make it to 3 stars from 4","March 11, 2012",1
mobile phone,Good for the Money,Richard Spafford,R27YLIVQ2AXVC8,3,"I purchased this because I wanted a decent smartphone without the exorbitant prices for monthly service for contract phones. That's exactly what I got. I don't talk much on the phone, and since I'm ancient, don't text:-) I really only have three complaints about this phone, which is otherwise worth every penny.The 1st complaint is that it has the older Android 2.3 OS. I have tablets with 4.0 and 4.1 and had a 3.2 before it was upgraded. There is NO comparison between these more advanced OS's and the one on this phone. I don't really mind it, but it's not nearly as useable.The 2nd complaint is the enormous amount of non-removable (without rooting) bloatware. A few of those apps are OK, but, serioiusly T-Mobile and Samsung, that's the most bloat junk I've ever seen, and I have a LOT of devices (addicted).The 3rd and most important negative is that the volume control is directly opposite the on/off button--side to side--so it's easy to turn your volume waaaay down or completely off while turning the phone on OR off. This bit me hard one day when I never heard a medical emergency phone call from my wife. This last problem is critical, but can be worked around by just paying attention to the problem.I'm not sorry I bought this phone. It is my first smartphone and without paying a lot for the phone or being tied into a contract, I now understand why folks are so crazy about them. The contract I chose is month to month and gives me all the calling and texting I'll ever need, as well as 5GB of data, which is fantastic for the price.Will I keep it? Heck, no. As soon as the new phone tsunami comes this fall and before Christmas, I will be buying the best one I can find. My wife will love this phone:-)The buying experience from Amazon was excellent, as usual...and no, I don't work for them.","September 10, 2012",1
mobile phone,This deserves 3.5 stars,Brett Kumataka,R38780UEW3CTSO,3,"This is one of the best budget smart phones I could find for T-mobile currently. I have a 2 year contract with T-mobile and it is not prepaid. I had bought a used HTC G2, but it bricked after 1 year of use. Since I purchased the HTC G2 used and it wasn't covered with warranty I was left to find a smart phone to use. When I went to a T-mobile store, buying a smart phone from the kiosk would cost 350 and up. The current flagship smartphone for T-Mobile is the HTC One S and has a list price of 599. Even with the offer to split the payment over several months, the idea of spending that much for a smart phone that would be obsolete in a few years bothered me. At almost half the price of what was being offered at T-mobile's kiosk, I found this phone.I quickly discovered there are many bargain android smart phones that are unlocked (can be used on multiple carriers). If you are in the market to purchase a phone and already have a plan, be sure to check that the bandwidth frequencies are compatible. Some of the 3g and 4g phones will work fine with AT&T; and not with T-Mobile (only EDGE). I found while searching the budget android phones, screen size varies greatly. Some of the cheaper phones around 100 seemed to have a smaller screen. Given it is the primary input, I knew that typing text messages and emails on a tiny screen would be irritating unless it had a physical keyboard or large enough screen.The Samsung Exhibit II is now a little dated, but comes with Gingerbread and a bunch of unnecessary apps that cannot be uninstalled unless you root the phone. Rooting the phone voids the warranty and is the only reason why I have not done so already. The response to input on the phone is fairly snappy and runs smoothly even though the RAM is a little small. The screen quality is surprisingly good and sharp. Call quality is decent. I was even able to make a video call with the phone and had no issue with it. The battery life with this phone has been typical of android phones that I have used, lasting about a day with moderate use before needing to be recharged. T-mobile's 4g network is very fast where I live, but is throttled after a certain amount of data has been used. At this price range, I think it is an excellent value.The reason I have given this product an only average rating is that text messaging would not work for a week. I went through all the typical troubleshooting methods and reset to factory default twice, contacted Samsung and T-mobile customer support to get text messages to send. Samsung was very unhelpful and stated that issues with text messaging are an issue with the phone service provider. T-mobile initially stated that it was Samsung's fault for not updating the drivers. When going through the T-mobile's forums, it became clear that I am not the only one with this issue. For a while the only way to send text messages was to disable the 4g and switch to EDGE. This bothered me a lot as it became very annoying to switch every time I wanted to send a text message. I was originally going to return this phone, but decided to call T-mobile one more time. The tech at T-mobile was able to fix the issue and stated that there was an error on their end and I am now able to send text messages. I've now had this phone for over a month and have not had any other issues.On a related note, the customer service at Amazon was stellar. I had called them stating my frustration with the product and how it was not operating as advertised. The CSR was very friendly and answered all my questions regarding Amazon's return policy. I am continually impressed by the competitive prices and customer service from Amazon.","June 28, 2012",1

mobile phone,"Phone itself is great, but T-Mobile customer services are terrible",Value Shopper,R2WNR8IZVE7WR0,3,"The phone is great in regards the combination of speed, feature, and cost. However, if you plan to port your number from a postpaid plan to a prepaid plan within T-Mobile, be prepared for some frustrations and watch out for ways T-Mobile wants to rip off you. I did as suggested by someone else from online forums, activated my new phone online first with the unlimited data/text plus 100 minutes, then called T-Mobile to port my number from a postpaid plan to this prepaid plan, the first person I talked to assured me that she would convert everything over and I would see changes within 24 hours, nothing happened after the 24 hours, I called again the second day, this time a different lady told me that the conversion never took place, then she told me that she couldn't do anything, she had to direct me to an account specialist to cancel my current postpaid plan first then send the number to the prepaid account, when talking with this account specialist, he told me that he could only convert my postpaid plan to a new prepaid plan account and I might have to forfeit my balance on my other prepaid account that had just set up a day ago. Since I don't trust T-Mobile to set up a prepaid plan for me (I had read a review that they had assigned a wrong plan for someone) especially after all inconsistency I have been experiencing with them lately, so ends up I had to choose to give up my existing number. As a comparison, I had no trouble to port numbers for my other two phones from T-Mobile to Virgin Mobile, I only needed to talk one person from Virgin Mobile and everything went smoothly within two hours.In conclusion, I would give a four-star for the phone, but a one-star for T-Mobile customer services.","December 5, 2011",1

It lags really bad after a few uses and god help you if you try to make back to back calls, because it simply won't work. It won't let you hang up, find another number, and immediately place a call. You have to wait a minute (literally) and then, if you're lucky, it will work. I have antivirus installed and know that the phone is clean. It's great with using apps and overall I like the phone. It's just a few quirks that irritate me and prevent me from giving it a better review. It's still not bad for the money.

mobile phone,"Starter phone, can be a great MP3 player.","Mlak Sva ""Mlak Sva""",R3BZ7MMIS5JVTB,3,"Well, as stated by others, this is not a top tier phone. It gets 'wonky' when you have a lot of apps installed, especially if the apps have notification features activating frequently. It's a starter phone, and the pricing relfects it. It's a good phone for making and receiving phone calls, texting, not so much for interactive data services. One thing I have found great about this phone is if you are interested in great quality music, try downloading the 'Poweramp' application at your app store. For a pittance, it turns the ho hum audio into a high end audiophile machine. I broke my old (4 month old) Exhibit from T Mobile, simply removed the SIM card, flash card, and kablamo, I was back in business. Now as to T Mobile itself, well, it's a 'starter' network. If you need business/ enterprise class calling/data service, try another network. This is a 'weekender' product and package.","June 30, 2013",1

Unusable out of the box, transformed into a very nice phone thanks to devs, CM10 and other jelly bean based roms. No longer have it but had fun rooting and loading different roms back in 2010-11. Will always remember this little guy. Loved high res LCD 800x480 on 3.7"" is still very nice today. My new 4.5"" has lower ppi than this. Everything looks vibrant and nice. 3MP camera is better than other 3MP in its class for stills and video. I was excited to use the front cam with skype. Was my first smart phone with the front cam. VGA but still useful. Removable back cover, replaceable battery, if that matters. Takes standard size sim. Runs different GPS apps, almost never had gps issues.My only complaint the ringer is very quiet, compared to other phones i've head by Nokia and LG. The volume rocker is very soft. I often accidentally pressed it with my fingers. Out of the box needs to be rooted, debloated, custom-rommed, app2sd a must due to low internal memory.

Decided to get a TMobile phone so that I can take advantage of the 4G service since Iphone is only capable of Edge web service and it's pretty slow but does the job. Anyways my complaints are that it's very buggy, the apps shut down suddenly, has good standby battery life but other than that drains very fast during use. The touchscreen is sometimes slow to respond and it freezes constantly. I hate the droid emoticons, they scare me, those ugly booger looking things! Also I came to notice that T-mobile smartphones come with a lot of bloatware, apps that come pre-installed & I can't delete eventhough I have no use for them, which sucks very badly, shame on you T-Mobile.

mobile phone,Affordable phone okay performance,John Sheridan,R3FOOA0JFIT62A,3,Samsung Exhibit II is an affordable smartphone that would make an excellent first smartphone. The phone has descent performance but do not expect it to be a performance powerhouse. While the processor is fast enough the phone could use significantly more memory. Once many multiple apps are running the phone starts running very slow. The best way to remedy this is to clear the memory in task manager which ends inactive and background processes. Doing a memory clear gets the phone back to a more operational speed. I've found that I'm better off using the integrated web browser. Firefox doesn't run too well on the phone. If you are looking for your first smartphone and don't have a ton to spend this phone is for you. If you do have a lot to spend buy a phone with more memory and a larger higher resolution display.,"January 12, 2013",1

mobile phone,"Awesome feature set, too bad about the unpredictability","Durrell fan ""Camera Nut""",RNHIQ8C9UFBLL,3,"When the phone is fully functioning, its a excellent piece of hardware. Sure it could be better, but for around $200, its worth it.Now the catch is the 'when it is working correctly'. The phone has the ability to use VOIP for calling when in a Wifi zone (which makes up for T-mobile's bad coverage). The catch is when you try to switch back to the cell network. Its a hit and miss on a good day. 9 out of 10 times, you have to restart the phone to get the connections to reset. This to me is a basic flaw in the phone. Worst is lets say when you had to rush out from home where it was on WiFi, and then as you get somewhere, you need the cell ON, but of course you now have to restart it and wait to make that emergency call at the airport or somewhere like that! Thats just bad design.","April 2, 2012",1
mobile phone,Decent phone for it is price,Nasu,R26KM13CNKNA3H,3,"Purchased this phone to replace my old Samsung Behold phone. This is my first day impression:Pros: Good price for the phone. Most android phones cost over $200 and this one is below that, it came with all the Google apps you need. The 3.7"" screen is a reasonable size. One of the Samsung smartphones that actually comes with a flash and a front facing camera. SD card is located at a very convenience location. Customizable in many different ways. And Wi-fi calling is very cool.Cons: Built quality is OK. Lighter than what I expected and lacks the premium feel to it. Screen resolution is not as good as other phone but it does the job. 3MP camera is so out of date. Speakers could be a bit louder. Battery life doesn't last that long. Too much bloatwares that you don't need, and some of them don't really work (even after updates). Experience performance lag from time to time. And no additional accessories (such as SD card or earpieces) are included.","January 6, 2012",1
mobile phone,Pantech Crossover Go Phone,James A. Marusek,RC79GK1A755OT,3,"The phone works fine. It meets my expectations. There was no $25 Airtime Credit. But Amazon made good by crediting my account for the amount of the credit.We live out in the boonies. As a result we have zero bars on the cell phone, that is why we do not own a cell phone but rely on a landline phone. But it is nice to have a portable phone when we are up and about. We use a go-phone and that works well except there is no reception near our house.I heard that Blackberry/iPhones type phones can get better reception. So I thought it was worth giving this type of phone a try as a second go-phone (for the wife) so we can find each other when we are separated in the mall or large mega store. Well it worked. I can now even get one or two bars at my home.I talked to the AT&T; representative and he said this type of phone can take advantage of the newer towers and that is why the reception is better than a normal go-phone.There was no $25 airtime credit even though it is clearly identified on the box. I followed the directions given in the instructions. The credit should have appeared within an hour after phone activation, except it didn't. When you call AT&T;, you need to have the phone's IMEI number handy. This is buried inside the phone. You need to remove the battery to see it. AT&T; uses this number to determine if the phone has a credit or not. I found out later that sometimes phones are part of a promotion but after the promotion is over the credits disappear. The buyer (in this case Amazon) may be unaware that the purchased phones no longer support the promotion's airtime credit. Thus the mix-up. Amazon refunded a credit for the lost airtime minutes. So all worked out in the end O.K. except it takes time to work through the problem.","December 15, 2011",1
mobile phone,"It's not bad at all, it's just not great.",Thowe Ritsie,R3SHPENG4OJ9DP,3,"This phone obviously features the android platform which, in itself, is a 5 star product. The apps you can get for no cost whatsoever are fantastic, and it is worth noting that the phone has no trouble accessing these or anything else on the web, aside from insanely small text presentations at first. You'll have to zoom in on 80% of the content you browse, but all in all, it does seem worthwhile. The only problem with this version of android is it's definitely well beyond outdated at this point, and it will not be changing at any point in time. This means a lot of the newer programs are totally incompatible and you're totally SOL if you want to get firefox on this phone.The phone itself makes computers of last century look like dirt. Compare it to it's contemporaries and you'll find it's moreso on the average point in the spectrum. The user interface can be intimidating for new smart phone owners, but it does become rather fluid before long. It's at that point you begin to notice the speed shortage. For one thing, the accelerometer (thingy that makes the screen display correctly whether you're holding it sideways or upside down) seems to have a REALLY hard time keeping up. A lot of times the screen will display incorrectly after unlocking the phone for some reason. It's not a huge problem, but it definitely cheapens the experience.The speed while browsing through menus is relatively good. I've found programs load slower than web content, which seems a bit odd, considering the difference between local and VERY distant files, but it is what it is. This includes, and isn't limited to, the most basic of functions, including the phone function itself. It may take several seconds to open up the dialing interface or make an actual call. That said the calls aren't pitch perfect by any means, but it does get the job done well enough. I've never experienced static or any kind of echo effects like I have in other phones. The speaker phone is a bit quiet and difficult to use in a room with any noise at all. Both speaker, and earpiece have a very trebly tone that can be a bit abrasive, so you may want to dial it down a little before using the earpiece.The camera is pretty mediocre and it has no flash. But for all intents and purposes it is functional in most situations. The most endearing feature of this phone for me is the slide out keyboard. I hate onscreen keyboards. They don't work with my fingers. So the real keyboard is very satisfying, considering my use, or overuse, of texting. The buttons are large enough and well labeled and the function keys are simple and easy to get used to. It does light up as well, so in a dark room it's just as easy to use. The touch screen itself is just OK. It's better than I thought it would be, but smaller icons are extremely annoying to actually activate for me. Seems like touch screens just hate big fingers.Despite what you may perceive the above to mean, I do think this is an excellent device. You'd have to be pretty ungrateful for the leaps technology has taken to be able to ignore the fact that you have the internet in your pocket with speeds that make aol and even some forms of dsl look like turtles in quicksand. For the true yuppies out there, you're probably not going to be satisfied with a phone that doesn't have a bat signal or an on call helicopter, but for the regular folk looking for an awesome gadget, or the smart phone newbie looking to sample the market without signing a forever long contract, this will absolutely get the job done.*for the record, a 5 star phone would have both a bat signal AND an on call helicopter service*","March 27, 2012",1

mobile phone,At&T; does not want to honor the $25 credit,Daisy,R31YT2QAYDWBPB,3,"The phone is nice, no problems yet...My rating is based on AT&T; and their lack of customer service. It took a LOT of time and effort to get AT&T; to credit me the $25 the phone is supposed to come with. First you should know that you must put down at least $25 before they will even consider giving you your credit, which was fine with me... then they will say it will take 24-48 hours to credit to your account. After a few days when you call to discover they have not credited your account you will try to contact customer service to find out why. When you contact customer service it's automated and the robot does not understand anything you say. Be prepared to get angry and want to break things. The best part about AT&T; is after being put on hold and going through their million menus just to talk to a Rep, when they connect you, you will get a message that says your call cannot be completed, please try again. Oh yes, at that point the phone just about went through a window. I got the message at least 3 times. For the record, they disabled the ""press 0 to talk to a real person"" feature. Finally, I get to talk to somebody after numerous attempts. This time while I'm on the phone the guy wants the code that is under the battery. Um ok? If I take the battery out of the phone the call will be lost...So after explaining the fact that removing the battery from a phone you are talking on will result in losing the call, he said he didn't HAVE to have the number after all. Then he asked me if I wanted to upgrade the plan from what I signed up for $2/day unlimited to the $50/month unlimited. I told him no. He tried talking me into it and I explained to him this phone is a birthday gift for a 9 year old and phone calls and texts are for emergencies only. He asked me what time it was, and I told him. He said he would call me back by 2 pm with the credit information. By 2:30, I did not hear from him and was getting ready for my daughters birthday party. By 5 pm, he had called 6 times but I was so busy making up for lost time & was nowhere near the phone to know he even called. I checked the balance and the credit was still not there.The next day I called AT&T; again. This time I got a lady, she said ""Oh, I see here in the notes you want to upgrade your plan to the $50/month unlimited."" I told her no, I am not sure why they keep trying to get me to upgrade it to that plan. Like I said, this phone is for a child, she does not need unlimited anything. Anyway, the lady finally credited the phone. It was just too much of a hassle.The good news that came from this is my husband and I were thinking about switching phone carriers and upgrading our phones...we can now cross AT&T; off our list of potential carriers.","October 13, 2012",1
mobile phone,Works fine as a kid's phone.,E. L. Singley,RWGFMDOK4ZPJ7,3,"I purchased this as a gift for my 12 year old niece. The $25 credit did not work but also did not concern me as I never intended to keep minutes on the phone for her to use anyway. She loves having a phone that can run apps and is constantly getting and trying new games on it. She uses it constantly for youtube and the kindle app as well and really loves it. So far it seems plenty rugged enough, she has performed multiple drop checks and it's still going strong. It does only run android 2.3 and came with older but a quick visit to the pantech website is all it takes to updated to 2.3, their updater program ran flawlessly and didn't take long to finish. Since the credit it was advertised as coming with didn't work and the hardware is quite dated now I could only see my way to giving 3 stars, but that shouldn't be taken to mean I don't like it. As a first phone for a child, especially if you are going to let them use it more as a tiny tablet and not bother with the phone functions, it is great.","November 16, 2012",1

Going back and forth between the keypad and screen is not as easy as we thought either. But it is a good entry level price for an android phone.One gripe with this phone's programming (I have another with the same Android OS) is that when you lock it, a toddler can hit an emergency dialer button and call 911 with one press, rather than having to manually enter it. I suppose it seemed like a good idea to a designer who hadn't tried it. After a few callbacks from EMS, we had to leave it unlocked, but then the baby just calls the last person dialed and makes noises at them - everyone pretty much knows who it is by now, and we have put Kidsplace on it so that apps and dialing are limited to what we would allow, but that adds extra time to using the phone for the adult in the room.*I know, just keep them away from the phone, right? :) It is really useful to be able to say ""Johnny (name changed, of course), bring me the phone,"" less so when EMS is dialing you by the time it gets to you.","April 10, 2014",1

mobile phone,Great Starter Android Phone but VM Reception Needs Improvement,NewsView,RGLBQMXGMJT5S,3,"I have owned the LG Optimus Slider (VM701) phone nearly a month. My spouse and I were able to take advantage of a Radio Shack special for Christmas 2011 that made this a far better buy. I can't complain about Virgin Mobile's service. We had to call customer service a couple times during and after activation and the reps were always friendly and we were not disconnected. That being said, I would advise that you activate your phone online. I called in my activation but had to go online before it ""took"". It took me about four hours for the phone to activate using my existing cell number but nearly two days and several phone calls for my spouse. (There is an ""activation status"" link on the Virgin Mobile website.)As a first-time Android owner it is fun to explore the Android marketplace, where it is possible to download a number of apps directly to the handset. You name it, there's an app for that. That's the good news. Now for the bad: with 181MB internal memory -- not the 512MB indicated in Amazon's description -- the VM701 fills up very fast when running apps that must utilize or reside on that space. Here's what we learned: All apps, even apps that can move to the included 2 gigabyte micro SD card, require some of that internal memory to operate. To write text messages or the like, you must always have internal memory free or errors and freezes will occur. I loaded enough apps at one point to come within 14MB of the internal memory limit only to encounter a severe memory outage. My phone froze and I had to reset the battery five times in a row before I caught a tiny status message on boot-up indicating that memory had run out. Consequently, if I had to name one bad thing about this mobile phone it is that you will run into memory limitations very quickly if you go ""app happy"" like I did. Some apps, like wallpapers and themes, insist on running on internal memory and you will have to make decisions about what takes priority. I recommend a minimum of 20MB free of internal memory at all times to avoid crashes and hangs.I am not sure if it is the phone or the Gingerbread OS but this phone sometimes has a mind of its own. I set a custom ring tone for my spouse and after two weeks it decided to switch to the Virgin Mobile start-up tone. A check of the settings revealed that my custom ring tone was still in place and that my preferred ringtone for general calls had changed on its own. When my spouse calls I get the ""generic"" ring tone instead. The other thing that has caused a fair amount of frustration is that the ringer mutes upon boot-up, yet only intermittently so. I like to turn my phone completely off at night and if I don't remember to check the volume button on the side of the phone when switching it on the next morning I will find it on ""silent"" later in the day even though I did not enter the operating system settings to mute it. I still haven't ruled out if an app is causing the issue, which is possible because my spouse has the same phone and has not had this particular problem.Above and beyond anything else I *assumed* about this phone, my spouse and I expected that like our feature phones the LG Optimus Slider would support audible (spoken) caller ID. This is not to be confused with the visual caller ID where you see your contact's picture and phone number pop up on the scree when the phone rings -- this form of caller ID is built in and functions flawlessly. Rather, we are attempting to enable an overlay such that when the phone rings it reads aloud what is shown on the screen. Thus far, I have paid for several apps and downloaded all the free apps on the market for ""voice announce"" caller ID and it does not reliably work -- even for callers who are in our contact lists. Once in a great while it will surprise us by correctly stating who is calling but for the most part our phones ring as normal or, if the SVOX voice says anything at all, it is to identify all incoming calls as ""unknown"". In searching various Android websites, I learned that audible caller ID is supposed to be a stock menu option in the Gingerbread OS but for whatever reason LG and/or VM has altered the menu so that it is omitted or hidden. If VM customer service has fallen short on one measure, it is in the conflicting responses I received to this question. Nobody can tell me whether it is a carrier vs. a hardware limitation, and the PDF owner's guide I downloaded didn't address the subject either. A post to the LG forum didn't clear up the issue, and attempts to use LG's web email form failed as did the Virgin Mobile website support form, neither of which have been working recently. It may have been VM's decision to strip this option out of the settings menu in attempt to streamline the OS to run on the phone's limited memory but that doesn't explain why I can't get a stand-alone app to fill in for the missing function.The best thing I can say about this handset is that it is solid in feel and will allow you to experience Android smartphone functionality for a low monthly prepaid price. The worst thing I can say about this handset is that reception, coming from AT&T; and Verizon, isn't up to par. It's not clear whether the network is to blame or the phone itself is lacking for an adequate antenna. All we know is that calls commonly clip or cut out when one of us is inside a mall or big-box retail store (though not at home or in the car, typically). Still, it is to the point where my spouse has left a store to complete a conversation outside. LG voice quality is good and the in-call volume is adequate when reception is good. Whether reception is adequate in the first place is the wild card, however. This phone utilizes the SPRINT network and here in SoCal that network ought to be as good as any. Unfortunately, we have noticed that sometimes our phones can be side-by-side and one of us will get the 3G signal (green bars and indicator) and the other will get white bars and 3G symbol, which if I am not mistaken signifies a slower 2G data connection. Odder still, we were driving beneath a SPRINT tower one day where we had five bars and on the other side of the street behind a small fast food restaurant all data connectivity dropped temporarily. If I had to evaluate VM as a carrier for business use -- and if I do recall the TOS for VM the company actually forbids commercial use so this may be a moot point -- I would recommend against Virgin Mobile and its parent company, SPRINT. However, if your primary aim is to own a modern smartphone while saving more money than you can with any other provider at present for unlimited data and texting, this prepaid LG smartphone is a great value. The VM voicemail system is better than AT&T;'s because it will time-stamp messages but on the downside I had to download a ""missed call"" app to get a tone to alert me to a missed text or voicemail message. That is because the phone's built-in notification consists solely of a tiny icon on the status bar and an equally tiny LED light that glows green when the phone has completed charging and/or an unheard or unread message has arrived. Both are far too discrete and easy to miss, but fortunately there was an app to solve the problem.A lot of LG Optimus Slider owners have complained about battery life, whereas a PC Magazine website article describes it as ""excellent"". I wouldn't call it excellent but it has not been as bad as I expected, either. My spouse typically needs to recharge half way or so through the day, whereas I can get through an entire day without a recharge even with frequent use (for me that is WI-FI more than talk or text, thus far). The phone is rated for 4.5 hours of talk time but when fully charged an app I downloaded, ""Easy Task Killer"", indicates that I have six hours of talk time. I have not talked on the phone for more than an hour continuously, however, so I don't know how accurate that is. In any event, we each use an application, available on the Android market, to conserve battery life. My spouse uses the free ""Easy Battery Saver"" app and I paid for ""Juice Defender Plus"" to compare the differences. What we learned is that some of the optimization settings to eliminate drains on the battery can also disrupt WI-FI and data connectivity. We at first thought our phones were faulty because we downloaded a battery-saving app first thing, only to find that the phones would drop WI-FI at random sitting five feet from the router, or after going out and about the data connection would not surrender so that the handset could seamlessly pick up in-home WI-FI. We set our phones to use a static IP address and that helped moderately with the WI-FI issue. However, I highly recommend Juice Defender Plus because not only will it keep the battery going it has a ""mobile data"" force-on feature and WI-FI fix. Once I went to the application settings and checked those fixes I have had no further problem with random drops when switching between the VM data network and WI-FI. All this aside, if you have particularly bad battery performance it may be a defective phone or battery. If, on the other hand, you are a heavy user the solution may be to seek out a compatible aftermarket battery that is rated in excess of the stock OEM battery rating of 1500mA. Please be advised, however, that the use of a third-party battery may void your handset warranty.With respect to the slide-out keyboard, I am glad we opted for the LG Optimus Slider over the Optimus V, which differs chiefly in that it omits a physical keyboard. The Slider's QUERTY keyboard is much faster. In contrast, I find that the Swype keyboard is too narrow due to the limitations of the screen size, and therefore I am prone to making more mistakes on the virtual keyboard than its physical counterpart. That being said, I have been frustrated in that there appears to be some way of accidentally triggering a copy/cut/paste function. I still haven't quite figured out why but if there is something in my clipboard and I hit the letter ""v"" the content is either pasted in over what I am currently composing or lost, depending on the action I have accidentally triggered. I attempted to post this how-to question to the Virgin Mobile product page Q&A; for this handset but VM never posted it.The web via Android is generally accessible but not to be compared with the experience of a conventional Internet browser/computer connection. This mobile phone, other than the built-in YouTube app, does NOT support Adobe Flash (contrary to Amazon's description). Whether for this or some other reason, some websites that permit comments don't allow for successful login, nor the ability to submit comments using the built-in Google Android browser. Alternatives such as Dolphin, Opera or Skyfire mobile phone browsers are not much better in this particular regard. I have spent a fair bit of time retyping things that I lost because the cursor is missing from the comment field or the clipboard content I had intended to paste is pushed out by accidentally triggering the ""copy"" function while attempting to get a cursor to move or a ""submit"" button to work. As expected, there are some websites that are optimized for mobile viewing and others that are not. It takes good eyesight to make use of non-optimized websites. Normal newspaper print type is 9 points whereas the type on a conventional (non-mobile) web page, when viewed on this phone, hovers around 5 points. You can zoom in with the flick of two fingers but that, in turn, means that the text doesn't always wrap correctly for easy reading. I can understand why a lot of people who own these smartphones also end up buying a tablet. Fortunately, the LG Optimus Slider screen features crisp resolution and the brightness options are adequate for all but the most glaring outdoor conditions. The only downside in this regard is that the brightness adjustment is a manual one. This handset does not come equipped with a light sensor to automatically adjust screen brightness but you can always install a toggle switch on your home screen for instant access to this setting, if need be.The 800Mhz processor seems fast enough for most tasks. The phone bogs down a bit when multiple apps are going but game-play in Angry Birds, for reference, is smooth with few ""force quit"" issues. Internet radio via Pandora and iHeart Radio work well. Oddly enough, however, it took some doing to get the VM Live app to buffer the carrier's own streaming content. To my pleasant surprise, I also found an app that will allow iTunes to sync with my phone, and sound quality through the mono speaker or stereo headphone connection is quite good. On the flip side, it is puzzling why some apps insist on running even when you don't want or need them. Using the free and highly functional ""Android Assistant"" to perform backups and to browse the phone's internal file structure, one of the system processes that runs frequently in the background is the built-in Facebook app. This is both creepy and inexplicable given that I choose not to join Facebook and have no need to operate it. (Unfortunately, it ships with the phone and can't be deleted to free up space.)This handset is Bluetooth compatible and provides turn-by-turn GPS navigation functions, but I have comparatively less experience with these other than to say Bluetooth, GPS and data usage hasten battery drain. For GPS use I recommend a car charger, sold separately. As for the 3.2MP camera, I must admit that I was disappointed with image quality. Shutter lag is significant, which results in soft, unattractive pictures under artificial indoor light. There is no flash but the camera works better than my first impression led me to anticipate under natural light or sunlight with pleasing color accuracy. There is not a front-facing camera for video conferencing but that was not a high priority for me in the first place -- one camera is enough for the price. Last but not least, it is my understanding that the LG Optimus Slider will NOT receive the Ice Cream Sandwich (ICS) OS update because the internal memory and/or processor speed is inadequate to support it.All in all I am happy with the purchase of the LG Optimus Slider. The stars I have docked are for poor indoor reception foremost, and secondarily for the operational glitches that seemingly give this handset a mind of its own.","January 21, 2012",1
mobile phone,Pretty good phone,Fatima P.,R2NMK2YVG2ZR7Z,3,"I really liked this phone and got my mom and sister into getting this phone because it is much faster than other phones that Virgin Mobile had at the time. I really like the keyboard on the side and got used to it very quick. The only bad thing about this phone is its internal memory and that is the only reason it gets 3/5. It has a very small internal memory (around 180mb) and I find myself sometimes frustrated because I have to delete apps that I would very much like to have. I had to root my phone as well because I wanted more space for apps. My mom and sister seem to be doing well with their phones and they have not gotten any ""rooting"" done. They do not have so much ""things"" there as I do. Other than that, Facebook does crash a lot but after a ""force stop"" it goes back to normal. It is a pretty good phone and does not freeze when you are online and you get a call or does not take a long time to turn on or off. The shipping was good and the three of us got our phones on time. Thanks!","May 30, 2013",1
mobile phone,"Great ""next step"" device",C. Baker,R1J2TJ4N3CFYCA,3,"Bought this phone to get my foot in the door with a data plan. Works well. Love the slide-out keyboard.

mobile phone,much better slider than Samsung Intercept,PC Mountain,RU627OQMLT9Q7,3,"If possible I would give this phone 3 Â½ stars. The Optimus Slider is worlds faster and more reliable than my previous Virgin Mobile phone the Samsung Intercept but it still has some problems. It occasionally shuts down and the only way to restart is to remove the battery. Also, sometimes it will get really hot and blow through all your battery power in about an hour as if every app on the phone is running at once. To alleviate this problem I highly recommend the Advanced Task Killer by ReChild. Installing this app appears to have fixed that problem but I have to be dilligent about killing apps. Other than these two issues I've been happy with this phone especially coming from using one of the worst smartphones ever, the Intercept. However, if it breaks I probably won't buy it again. I'll be tempted to try out something else. Overall though I don't regret purchasing this phone and it was worth the low $180 price. However, if you don't need the sliding keyboard I would recommend going with the regular Optimus instead. That phone is lighter and smaller.","May 29, 2012",1
mobile phone,Good phone.....back in 2011.,Kel,R3EL4FI4H505WG,3,"ok i've been having this phone since maybe 2012 and overall this is a decent phone. Back in the day when apps were small in size, i was on cloud 9. Nice size, responsive and qwerty keyboard was all i needed. Although i did have sporatic functioning of the wifi. Where it would connect to the network then after an idle period would not transmit data. I looked over that prob b/c all i had to do was stop and start wifi to get it to work again. That still happens btw. Fast forward to 2014 and you have problems.1. 512 internal memory - This doesn't cut it for todays apps. Unless you don't install any apps your going to run into memory issues. I've rooted mines in order to install Link2SD which allows you to put internal memory apps on the SD card. That in itself isn't a clear fix b/c even though the app is linked to sd , memory usage still registers under internal memory. Belive me, it sucks when your phone starts giving low memory warnings. It causes you have problems running apps and upgrading them. Almost all apps upgrade frequently and with each update they eat more memory. ( i screen updates now for that reason). That trend won't be ending anytime soon with the larger memory phones coming out.2. Small screen - most phones these days have large screens that make it easier to type using the screen instead of a qwerty keyboard. (don't get me wrong, i still love the qwerty, but it seems to be going away on newer phones)3. Camera isn't worth using. No flash, any (and i mean ANY) movement creates blurred pics. low light pics are extremely dark but its a low end phone so you shouldn't expect much. But when i compare to some newer phones it makes me want to slowly hide my phone in my back pocket. Just keep a point and shoot handy.I think nowadays this is more of a older persons phone. If you're someone who isn't concerned about new apps and just want to talk,surf the web and maybe play candy crush you're ok. If you want to store pics/video, have productivity apps galore, play games and surf the web then save your money for something more powerful.","March 28, 2014",1
mobile phone,Runs just as fast as it did the day I bought it,Retrogamer,R19JF89N2Y2X52,3,"If you want an Android with a full keyboard, this is a decent phone. I'll try to not be sentimental about it since this was my first smartphone. The phone's weak points are that its internal storage is small (512 MB) so you are always having to consolidate it, the version of android on it is kind of outdated (2.3) and its battery life is not the greatest. I have optimized mine by rooting it and running the CPU at a slower speed, but there are better phones out there. If you are interested in this phone, you'd do better to buy the Kyocera Rise. It has 2GB internal memory, more than double the battery life (in hours) and a lower price point. I bought this phone shortly before the Rise appeared on the market and now I wish I had been a little more patient. But that's okay because when my Optimus Slider bites the dust I can get a cheap upgrade by buying the Rise. :)","February 22, 2014",1
mobile phone,Really Frustrated!!,Nicole Schofield,R1V4VAWCYZ5C1S,3,"I bought this phone about a year ago super excited because I had switched from the OV and really wanted a keyboard for faster typing. It broke about a month ago and the touch screen COMPLETELY doesn't work. I can't use the screen and if it weren't for the keyboard, I wouldn't be able to use the phone. I had to use all apps by using the arrows on the keyboard. I have reset the entire phone twice and it still won't work. The overall phone (while it worked...) was great. If you switched from OV there are a lot of benefits...Plus---The keyboard is A LOT faster than swype or the regular android keyboard on the OV and makes typing very easy.-The speech to text search app in the phone works great and a lot better than the OV-No ""butt-dialing"" -- the phone doesnt open by touching any of the home buttons on the bottom of the device.-Sound is louder but not too much better for quality.-Faster and better looking quality on the screen.-The phone is really comfortable in your hands, yet still a good size (not too big or small)-The camera is *a little* bit better than the OV. Takes better picture .-Battery life much longer! Lasts at least 3 hours longer than OV-Call quality betterCons---Very little space -- I had constant notifications that I could not download apps because I was low on space. I.e., I suggest getting a second microSD for extra space when needed.-I don't know if anyone else has been in my situation of it breaking, but it could happen on another slider or with a similar situation.OVERALL:I think this is a great phone for someone who wants to be able to connect easily and doesn't have time to slow down in there lifestyle. Although if you've had the OV before, you probably won't see much of a difference. That just might be me. I recommend it for people who want a smartphone that is simple and easy to use.

mobile phone,Decent smartphone for the price,Muser,R2C5OL1283VJIJ,3,"This is my first smartphone. I've held off getting one because I didn't want to spend a lot on the phone or the bill. The phone is pretty decent. The battery lasts longer if you download an app like Juice Defender, though sometimes it feels like my battery still runs out fast. Also, it tends to lose the data connection intermittently so I constantly have to reboot my phone. I'm willing to deal with the downsides in order to continue having a decent cell phone bill. I also specifically chose this phone for the physical keyboard. I cannot type on a touchscreen keyboard to save my life. I fat finger everything! The touchscreen is ok simply for navigating through the phone and selecting things, as long as I don't have to type.","June 17, 2012",1

mobile phone,Its an ok phone.,lay,RIQUU9V3BM4AK,3,"Ok I've had this optimus slider for a month now and for the most part its fine. Coming from a verizon bill nearly $100 dropping down to a $50 bill is a good thing. The few problems I have or had are a few dropped calls, but thats sprint I would think. On my last phone I was able to have my phone on vibrate and when someone texted it gave 3 long vibrations. This phone do not. It vibrates a quick second and thats it. It never notifies you again that you have a text. The same goes for a missed phone call, it makes no vibrations ever again if you missed a call. The only way for you to no if you have a text or missed a call is to look at your screen or this tiny little light that turns green. Also I cant find how to make 3 way calls, but thats probably just me, though I looked everywhere on how to do it. The phone is also a little slow to bring up web pages or anything that requires the net like hanging with friends game. All in all its a fine phone.","December 27, 2011",1

mobile phone,"Nice phone, beautiful screen, and lots of Samsung bloatware",Trae Greenlee,R12YGP12DYS58Z,3,"This is my opinions of the N7000 not the downgraded AT&T; version.I currently use a Galaxy Nexus i9250 GSM and I have been using Android OS4 for about two months so this will of course color my opinion.The N7000 I used was running Android 2.3.5 and had a broken SIM socket, I bought this from the Amazon warehouse outlet and now I know why it was there in the first place. I was unable to use the cellular parts of the phone because of this.I was intrigued with the Note since it launch due to the impressive specs and I felt the very large screen would be a plus since I read a lot of e books on my phone.I was hesitant to buy this because of my very poor experience using ATT's Captivate primarily because of TouchWiz but this phone has the latest TouchWiz version and no carrier bloat and had very good reviews so I decided to give it try.First impressionWow! beautiful phone,awesome display, bright, and vibrant.I like the home button, its convenient having a very easy to find way to wake the phone in the dark.Camera took very nice pictures, a bit better than the Nexus but not nearly as fast as the Nexus.No Carrier bloatware and tethering is enabled just like it should be.The bad (my opinion)TouchWiz, I really enjoyed the minimalist software approach the Nexus has. TouchWiz has taken the opposite approach, there are loads of apps I may not use and nearly every application has been modified from the stock versions in some way. This wouldn't be so bad except you can not uninstall them for example social hub, music hub, readers hub, and photo editor. These are just some that I would have chucked if I could.I find TouchWiz to have no advantage over the stock launcher and would rather just not have it to start with.What I would like to see from Samsung and for that matter any android phone manufacturer is a stock Android install where the custom applications and launcher are optional and can be installed or removed at will. This would perhaps make updating the OS quicker and get the Android community closer to having a current os on every device.Yes, I could have rooted and installed custom firmware but would rather not spend my time fixing something that shouldn't be broken to start with.I returned the phone due to the SIM socket problem and ordered another Nexus because of TouchWiz.","March 3, 2012",1

mobile phone,Next best thing to a true smart phone,"wwell ""wwell""",R1E596NVBQQAB,3,"I have had this phone for 10 days. It was annoying that TracFone or their vendor would repeatedly text me to promote their airtime cards. Yesterday alone, I received three such promotional texts from 360 460 8637. If you know how, please let me know how to stop this unwanted solicitation. Those text messages cost me MY air minutes!!! It is crazy that they would make customers pay for their spams.I had a hard time setting up voice mail box. The keypad just wouldn't recognize the password I entered. I had to call tech support twice. First time after a 15 minute wait, It took me 30 minutes to follow the agent's trial and error instructions. After 30 minutes, she had to do a complete reset and I was instructed to wait for 4 hours before turning the phone on to find out if the reset worked. It didn't. Made another call. This time, took the agent 45+ minutes but she was able to fix the problem in that call. Both times, I used a land line because I knew it would deplete my air minutes like crazy. Even with that, all the testing, try and error, they used up more than 60 air minutes. The 2nd agent was kind enough to give me 60 minutes back. Not sure if I got an older model (from LG through Amazon), both agents seemed to have problems figuring out the model I have because they kept on telling me to press (differnt) buttons that my phone didn't have. The good thing about Tracfone's tech support is both agents were patient and respectful. Although I wouldn't rate them high in product knowledge or trouble shooting skills but they got gold stars for customer handling skills.I bought a one year 400 minute card from Safeway for $99. Because LG800G is a triple minute phone, the 400 minutes tripled to 1200 minutes. Tracfone then double the minutes and duration on top of that. So I ended up with a total of 2400 minutes expriring in Aug 2014 (2 years). Had I got the card from Amazon, it would have cost me less ($84.99 plus shipping). Does anyone know if the one year card purchased from Amazon would also double the minutes and expiration date?LG800G is light and small (than Blackberry for example). The keypad and QWERTY are tiny even for someone with small fingers. But they work if you use a pen to enter numbers or text. I followed the recommendation from another reviewer to get screen covers and a protector case (Mageta). They are well worth of the few extra dollars.It holds charge well if you don't use it. But it loses charge and uses up air minutes quickly if you text, surf the net, make or receive calls. To preserve the minutes, I use it mainly as an answering machine or making calls only when a land line isn't available.So far this phone is doing everything a no contract, pay-as-you go tracfone should do. It is perfect for those who are light cell phone users.","June 15, 2012",1
mobile phone,"Like the Features, But... Buggier Than my Apple Tree","Country Girl ""Country Girl""",R2PZJT8XYKCTC8,3,"I received my new Tracfone 800G this last week. It took 2 days to activate it which seems excessive, but my old Tracfone number and my minutes and airtime transferred with no problem. And I love the touch screen and features like the camera and querty screen. However when I was setting everything up I encountered several significant problems. 1) when I dial a call or am in a call, the phone locks every few seconds, preventing me from accessing the speaker, keypad, etc quickly. I can make it past this if I keep ready to press off the lock icon constantly, but am looking for a more permanent solution. Even adjusting the security settings for lock to 'never', does not prevent this. 2) this was more of a problem, but I discovered a solution via the internet (thankyou internet). When I made a call that required use of the keypad to enter options (press 1 for english, 2 for espaniol, etc), and actually made it past the lock to select the keypad, the numbers would not be recognised. We all make LOTS of calls like this. I couldn't even set up my voice mail or call Tracfone customer support, because they start with these menus. So off to the internet and I found the solution, simple and it worked for my phone: turn off phone, remove back cover, battery, and sim card for one minute. Replace in reverse order and turn phone back on. The keypad now works during calls. I like the phone and especially the triple minutes, so I'll keep slogging through these problems.AN UPDATE: after much online research I have determined that the locking problem is a part of this particular phone and it's software. If you get a later version of the phone I believe they have fixed the software, but for the clearance/cheap one that I bought (only $12) you're stuck. I've gotten used to it and have adapted my actions when I need to use the keypad during a call. Otherwise the locking is not a problem for normal conversing. Oh well, you get what you pay for and I'm overall quite happy with the phone.","October 3, 2013",1
mobile phone,It's a very good phone for the price.,L. Phillips,RLVJQTM2Y5004,3,"I like it, the mp3 player sounds great, but.... The one thing that drives me crazy is the lock. If you're using the phone to call anywhere that you might have to use their automated system before getting through to a human, you'll go nuts. Between every prompt, the lock will activate. Within seconds of your last entry. To unlock and press the apropriate key, you have to hold down the ""unlock"" for two or three seconds (you might have to repeat this process before it actually unlocks), THEN press the keypad icon to get the keypad back before you can press ""1 for English"" or whatever you need to press. It can take so long that some automated systems will return you to the begining. THAT CAN MAKE A PERSON LOSE IT. So, if you only make calls like that at home from a landline, or the phone is for a kid who never has to call the bank, it's a great deal. If you do need to use it for those purposes, spend more on a different phone. In the end you'll be saving far more money that you'll eventually need to spend on psychiatry or a lawyer.","January 20, 2013",1

Old this deal was sweet but she's ready to pass the phone down already it comes woth too games and a few different wallpapers DO NOT USE THE CARTOON THEME it makes the phone look SUPER CHEAP & UGLY EVEN MY DAUGHTER HATES IT she wants to pass it along to her younger sibling because she tends to get bored with it compared to the vast majority of app's I have on my phone other then that ""yes she's spoiled"" it's a great phone for some one who infrequently uses there phone & who doesn't need multiple app's & web that's super fast I say go for it the price is exceptionally great even though I got a refurbished one for 5.00$ yep that's right 5.00$ I got a bang for the buck also a great back up phone thanx for reading hope this helps o","August 22, 2013",1

Triple minutes are a big plus, and it's a lot easier to get the promo minutes than my last track phone. Runs Java apps, 3gp video, several sound file types. Records video, sound and takes pictures.

mobile phone,"Nice Phone, Activation and Support Requires Time and Patience",Buyer,R13G1Y2H58AQLL,3,"Nice phone but transferring minutes and number from the old TracFone was extremely cumbersome and time-consuming. Initially, everything went well at the TracFone website until it came time accept the accumulated minutes they said I had. There was a discrepancy of over 850 minutes I didn't want to lose, so after spending a lot to time on line, I still had to call the 800 number and go through everything again with the customer service rep. She finally said she had everything taken care of--new phone activated, old number and minutes transferred to it--to turn both phones off, wait 15 minutes and try making a call on the new LG 800G.When I did as instructed, however, I found that the old phone was indeed disabled (no service, no minutes left on it), but the new phone had not been activated. Waited a while longer, then went to my account online and went through a another long bizarre process of entering multiple sequences of numbers to activate the new phone. When I finally succeeded, the number and all the minutes were indeed transferred. However, the date on this LG 800G is exactly one month ahead of today's date. It is Tuesday, August 21 but the screen display indicates that today's date is Friday, September 21.I read all instructions again, searched through the phone, and found no way to manually override the automatic date assigned. Another 45 minutes on the phone with a different customer service representative yielded no answer to the problem except that I should wait and see if it self corrects in a few days. . . She asked if I had been traveling through different time zones with the phone recently which could have caused it to re-set the time. But I explained that the time is not the issue. The time of day is correct. It is the DATE that is set exactly one month ahead. Problem not resolved. What I think this means is that I am probably losing a month of service time, but I could not seem to convey that concern to the TracFone rep, who consulted with her supervisor multiple times during the course of the conversation, and in the end came up with no plausible explanation or resolution.In summation, I like the phone and its features, and the order placed through Amazon.com was processed and delivered very quickly. But the date (day and month) on the new LG 800G is wrong, and the activation process and support was unsatisfactory when transferring unused TracFone minutes and an existing number from an old phone to the new one.UPDATE: Online research (through Google) revealed that several others in phone discussion groups had the identical wrong date problem on the LG 800G. One individual suggested removing the battery from the phone for a while. Today the date had rolled up to Saturday, September 22 when it was actually Wednesday, August 22, so I figured I had nothing to lose. I tried that suggestion and it worked! The phone date is now correct. Wonder why TracFone customer service couldn't have given me this very simple fix.","August 21, 2012",1

It is so frustrating, the only thing that I like about this phone is the camera; it not only has a still camera, but is also has a video camera, other than that it is an acceptable phone.

mobile phone,Good for the money - but camera and keyboard suck,Jill P.,RP4KDQ7LMVM1P,3,"I upgraded to a smartphone after having a crappy flip phone for a year while I was in between service providers. I decided to take the leap to the Optimus Elite for two reasons:1) I am a DSLR camera user, and I was psyched to have a camera that I could fit in my pocket and always have with me. My old smartphone, an HTC Hero, also had a 5MP camera and took great photos. I expected the same of the Optimus Elite. I've been sorely disappointed by every photo I've taken so far: blurry, grainy, out of focus, discolored, blech. I'm not sure if this is an LG issue or if this particular phone model just sucks camera-wise.2) I am a textaholic, and after suffering with a numerical keypad I was dying to get back to a QWERTY keyboard. My HTC Hero was slightly smaller than the Optimus Elite, and it had a great, responsive, easy to use keyboard. Again, I expected the same. Not at all. I am a petite woman with slim fingers, but for some reason, the Optimus Elite's keyboard is clunky and difficult to type on. Another big disappointment.For the price, this is a pretty decent smartphone, and after having Virgin Mobile for one month, I have no complaints as of yet (except for switching my old number to my new phone, what a nightmare!). Overall I am satisfied with it, but since the camera and the keyboard were my main reasons for getting another smartphone, I have to give it only three stars. I'm pretty sure I won't find a comparable phone for the same price, though, so for now it'll do.","October 25, 2012",1

mobile phone,You really should consider this phone...,Prize Udo,RPOGP7K9X807U,3,"Great first experience buying a Chinese brand phone. My initial fears were the same that most people have; am I buying an inferior product, is this too good to be true, and will it be compatible with Android features in the U.S.? All of them are legitimate, but gladly none of them are well founded in this case. If you are worried about some compromises between this phone and the Samsung Note II, then here is a bit of a run down. First, the back of the phone is not as durable as it could be. Also the screen isn't Amolded or anything like that but it is still a fairly good quality. Second, I don't believe that it carries the same ""beam technology"" that you will find on the Samsung S3. The phone was under $200 bucks...big deal. Third, you will definitely want to buy a memory card because the memory on the hard drive is almost non-existent. The camera quality, especially the front facing camera is...well...its bad really bad compared to other phones I've had, but in the same breathe its not the absolute worst either. You will have to decided on that.All in all the phone was a wonderful buy, and if you use the right seller you will have an awesome experience and your wallet will thank you. My friends were so jealous over the quality and the price of the phone, it just makes sense to me to NOT throw hundreds away for the sake of a name and a few bells and whistles...***Update***Ok so I used the Straight Talk ATT compatible sim with the phone and the call quality was...okay not great. BUT the stupid phone goes completely blank when placing or receiving calls!!! Others have complained about this problem.

mobile phone,I got a dud,C Fox,R1GSTSBIAO5DHL,3,"I must have just been unlucky, phone was actually pretty cool. Worked well, however the issues that I had with it are all battery related. First of all the battery is non-removable. Not a huge issue but with smart phones its nice if you can buy a higher capacity aftermarket battery. The reason I ended up returning the phone was that the battery ready was always wrong. When I tried to charge it all night it would never go above 79%, maybe it was actually up to 100% but since the battery life already wasn't amazing its very important to have an accurate battery reading. When it would start running down it would get to like 12% and then just turn off and be out of batteries. I have heard other people with this issue and was tempted to try and root the phone and see if that helped but ended up just returning it and getting the Evo V 3D, which has its own problems haha, but still is a better/more reliable phone than the HTC OneV.","October 14, 2012",1
mobile phone,"Not great in comparison to the Samsung Galaxy Victory, but decent for general use.",Kendra Trahan,R11IP0ZZBIR75D,3,"I had the Samsung Galaxy Victory from Virgin Mobile. I wanted to get something different because my biggest problem with the Galaxy Victory was that you cannot move apps to your SD card unless you root the phone. I'm utterly agitated that in order to use almost any phone efficiently, you have to root it and I DON'T want to root the phone.In comparison, I think I liked the Galaxy Victory better except for a few thing. On this particular phone, apps and the browser like to shut down randomly all the time. The phone tends to run very slowly as well. It does have its own task killer which is very efficient for getting the phone to run faster. You CAN move apps to the SD card, but the screen is smaller, and there is no front camera either. Plus, the rear camera is terrible in comparison. Battery life was about the same. If I'm constantly on it while off the charger, I can play games for about 2-3 hours but then it charges fairly quickly. Sometimes it doesn't alert me when the battery is low and will just shut off in the middle of something.I think for basic smartphone users, this is a fairly good phone to use, but don't be surprised if you experience some of these glitches (as it seems we tend to experience with every phone unless, OF COURSE, we root it).","April 30, 2014",1

mobile phone,It did the job... pretty well,Jessica J. Seladis,R2WJRLFGEHK0OF,3,"I bought this phone in Jan 2013.... and it is November 2013... And the screen is now shattered. I dropped it off my desk. I had the OtterBox 77-20218 on it. And that helped with the normal wear and tear a bit.The phone worked awesome for a bit but as the months wore on it became finicky. It would ring and when I tried to answer it would freeze and continue to ring. One time I waited to see how long it would ring before I did the manual reset and it was just over 10 minutes.Battery life is decent. I was able to stream Netflix and youtube pretty well.The GPS works well. I've only ever had a few instances when it was ineffective but that was when the last update for their Maps when through. It took some time for it to do anything!Over all, its a decent enough phone. It did the job for 11 months. I would recommend it to those who are gentle with their electronics.Things to know about Virgin (I've been with this company off and on since 2006)-- Sometimes TXT messages do get delayed. Happens to me regularly. Sometimes by a few minutes, sometimes by a few hours.-- Their coverage is pretty good.

mobile phone,"It's a good phone, not great, but good.",Chris,R2EZDG3PR9JH6I,3,"Picked this up on the gold box deal. Moved from my 25$ a month plan on my LG Optimus V to this one.In hindsight, while I am not entirely happy with the phone, it is a step up and I kind of don't regret losing the cheaper plan I was grandfathered in on.Pros!Battery life is pretty nice.Screen is bright, looks great.TONS of room to install apps. As I mentioned above, my old phone was an LG Optimus and had a whopping 200~ megs to install them.Beats Audio is actually pretty nice.Cons!Worst wifi I have ever used in my life. My touchpad, android tablet, old LG phone, etc all got 2-3 signal bars out of 3 while in my house. I barely even get the first little dot indicator on this one.Not exactly a thorough instruction manual (moving from 2.2 to 4.0 is fairly different).Phones shape is just, odd to me. It's not flat, and that little bar at the bottom pokes out strangely to me. That being said, I didn't take off any stars from the review for design issues. If it works, it works.Cell camera is kinda ""bleh"" but then again all of em are. BRIGHT LED flash lights up the subjects but also washes out the photos.Worse/slower data than my old LG on the same network.Basically, as I mentioned before, while I don't entirely regret losing my 25$ monthly plan and moving off my old LG, paying 10$ a month more for literally the same thing stings a bit when I don't like the reason I moved that much. It's a great phone, but there are some fairly strong cons to me about it, the major one being the weak wifi signal.Still, it cost me 50$ on the gold box deal, so if you can find it for around 50-60 and are upgrading from an older phone model, it's probably worth it. I would not, however, pay MSRP for this thing or anywhere near it.Virgin Mobile does have some awesome reps though, and when I called in to transfer my phone (mid month, and I wanted to see if I could keep my old month or if I had to start a new one), they peeked at the call record and saw I had only used ~20 minutes. Had me swapped out and going in about 5 minutes and the phone was working for texts in about 10 mins.4 stars for virgin mobile, 3 for the phone. If the buggy wifi gets fixed soon, then it'd be a 4 to 5 star phone. That slower data than my older device is really what kills the review for me.","January 16, 2013",1
mobile phone,Pretty good,xiongcp,R376OBSAKOXVXW,3,"This is my first smart phone, and I must say, I am NOT disappointed. The touch screen is fast, texting with the screen is fun and easy, and it's not too heavy. The only problems I have with this phone is sometimes I don't receive texts, or I can't send my texts out. I would get a message saying I don't have signal, when in the corner I have 2 signal bars. I solve this by turning my phone off for ten-twenty minutes but it still frustrates me. -1 star for this reason. The camera quality is not that great, and the 3D setting is pretty cool but it'll hurt your eyes for looking at the picture too long. The battery life is short, but I simply just carry my battery charger with me so it's not a big deal.","October 11, 2012",1

mobile phone,"Affordable, good phone; bad network",Chris,R3L11QY4TMGK7G,3,"After nearly a decade of average phone use I decided I needed to upgrade to a phone with more capabilities, mainly for email and web with a decent size display. Because I absolutely refuse to pay the ridiculous amount of money that Verizon and pretty much any other network requires for data, naturally I turned to prepaid and I decided to go big or go home with the Evo 3D rather than a cheaper phone with similar capabilities.Rather than writing some sort of essay, it's just easier to list the pros and cons with explanations where necessary:Pros:-The price! I pay $40/ mo. for unlimited data (with throttling), unlimited text, and 300 minutes! Before I paid $30/mo. on Sprint for just 300 minutes...Can't beat the price!!!!!!-Big display-Good microphone-overall good design (with exceptions for the home button (see below)-sturdy build quality-loads of good, modern features and options-decent hardware (I went with this one over the other Evo mainly because of the larger screen and the dual core processor)-Visual voicemail! I love this feature...Especially because I hear some people have to pay for it.-Data, 2.5 GBs before throttling. 2.5 GBs is quite a lot, especially since I use Wifi most of the time, I usually end up only using 1-1.5 GBs per month.-Ubuntu for Android. Not released yet, however as a huge Linux fan, this looks amazing, and from what I've read, this phone will support Ubuntu for Android when it's released.-No HDMI, but it has MHL through use of the microUSB port - Two in one!Cons:-AWFUL network! To elaborate: I've had Sprint for many years, and Virgin uses the same towers, as a result, you get the same mediocre service. I rarely have full bars, but usually have one or two, which is just enough for phone calls and sending the occasional text. It's ""Good enough"" but quite frustrating a lot of the time...Another problem with Virgin is the phone can occasionally ""lose communication with the network."" Now, the first time this happened I had no idea what was going on, my phone could not receive or place calls, nor send or receive texts. The internet still worked on Wifi, but not on the mobile network, which wouldn't even connect. I let this behavior continue for about 12 hours before giving in and calling Virgin mobile. Some substantial amount of time later I spoke with a technician that apparently ""reset the communication"" to my phone and I was instructed to remove the battery and leave it out for about 15 minutes. This whole bit sounded like a load of BS, and it most likely was. The next time this happened (and it has happened A LOT!) i simple removed the battery, left it out for a minute or so, then rebooted. Everything was fine after that. This would be a great solution if my case wasn't a pain to remove and put back on. To this day, I don't understand how a mobile communications provider allows this sort of dysfunctional behavior with their phones. By the way, this is not limited to my phone, a friend of mine has Boost Mobile (same Sprint towers), and he has the same problem. Note: After the previous update a couple weeks ago, this problem has not happened. I will update this review by removing this statement if it happens again.-No local 4G. Sprint doesn't offer 4G in my city, kinda sucks, but 3G is good enough -Update on 3G, see update 12/29/12--I don't like the placement of the home button A lot of times while typing, I may accidentally hit the home button with the side of my hand and it will close the app. This doesn't happen with the case on.-The keyboard sucks! This is not Evo 3D inclusive, but rather Android's problem. I can actually type faster and with much more accuracy on the keyboard on my iPod Touch (A MUCH smaller screen) Android did an awful job not leaving any space between the letters, but instead made the letters much bigger.-Standard smartphone battery life: 12 hours under normal use, less than 4 under heavy use...Bring your charger with you!-Outdated OS. To my knowledge there are no plans for releasing Jelly Bean for this phone under Virgin Mobile.-Sometimes calls don't come through. This is different from the problem above, I'll set my phone down in an area with plenty of service, but only a voicemail will come through and no missed call.-The camera: It seems like the phone must be held ABSOLUTELY still for a decent photo...They blur so easily! It usually takes 2 or 3 tries to get a decent picture.Final notes:-I don't really use the 3D much, as stated above I only chose this one due to the dual core CPU and the larger display. I tested the 3D, and it's a neat feature, but not worth paying more money for. I've only taken like 3 or 4 3D pictures, it's really no big deal.-I will update this review if anything changes.Update: 12-29-2012 -------------------------I've found another con with the data (3G):I'm usually on WiFi, as my house and work both have it and I rarely use the phone for video streaming or anything that requires a relatively fast internet connection. I've only really streamed video over WiFi, but I recently went on a trip where I didn't have access to WiFi and tried to stream video, and even though I had a constant 3-4 bars of service and ""3G"" (and not throttled, I was only at about 500 MB of data) the video was only standard definition and still unwatchable, the ""3G"" is far too slow for streaming unless you have constant full bars.However, The phone is working much better after the system update, the ""Radio interface resource shortage"" texting issue described above was definitely fixed, I haven't had to remove the battery since the update. My biggest complaints are still Sprint's terrible coverage, the 3G is slow, and the keyboard is awful (and I can't possibly stress how awful the keyboard is...)Final Update: 7-10-2013 -----------------------Switched to iPhone 4 from Virgin Mobile.Reasons:-The phone started to randomly restart/crash with more frequency (which caused me to miss an alarm in the morning).-The keyboard...It's literally the worst thing ever. The iPhone has a MUCH smaller screen, but its keyboard is sooooo much better.-Battery life. This was not a problem with the actual battery. The phone got to the point where I would charge it up at night (make sure very few apps were still running) and set an alarm, then the alarm wouldn't go off because the phone was completely dead in the morning 8-10 hours later of not being in use. According to the usage, most-all of the battery went to ""phone idle"" and ""cell standby."" However, I could charge it that day to 100% then it would last another 15-20 hours before dying. In other words, the battery would sometimes drain really quickly, or sometimes it would last forever. Too finicky for my taste.-The bottom of the touchscreen got a bit strange after a while. Pulling the ring would sometimes not work and I'd have to do it several times before I could actually unlock the phone.In conclusion, it's a good phone (maybe not for the current price when compared to the iPhone 4 for $30 more) with a TON of features (far more than the iPhone 4), but the software just isn't as thought out as on the iPhone. I almost never used the 3D features of the phone. I'll probably keep the phone anyways to use as a backup if anything happens to my iPhone and possible to play Android only games; but overall, the iPhone is still better.","December 1, 2012",1

mobile phone,Great phone. But not the carrier.,C. Chiu,RMF0YZK510NVQ,3,"I purchased this phone in hope to replaced my slow and outdated Virgin Mobile Samsung Intercept. I also own an iPhone 4 from work, thus I will include the iPhone 4 into comparison also. I love the phone, and the reason it loses 2 stars is due to carrier. Since this phone is Virgin Mobile only, I believe this 2 stars deduction is justified. Data speed do not include wifi connection experience.Price: I purchased this phone when it's at $230 brand new, which is a VERY GOOD price for a phone with its spec. (Until $150 during Cyber Monday sales and the release of Nexus 4)Battery life: a full charge can last me through a whole day of use (12 hours). I don't make call or sms as much, however, I do use the phone constantly for facebook, google reader or research (gas prices, nearby food, shopping research etc.) Considering the screen is larger than my iPhone 4, the battery life is longer (my iPhone 4 battery drains to 10% in 8 hours with similar usage, Samsung Intercept dies around 4.5 hours).Camera: The camera is not sharp. The image is constantly either too dark or too bright in one area, you will have to adjust carefully yourself, thus not so much of a point-n-shoot camera. The low light performance is not great, and much easier to have shaken image than iPhone 4. The 3D camera is cool, but somewhat useless as you can't share the 3D photo to others. Overall, it's ok in area with abundant lights. The most annoying part - you cannot set the camera sound to silent unless you want to go through the trouble of setting the sound OGG file to silent manually in Android files.Screen: it's HUGE and bright! (Comparing to the general iPhone and regular smartphones) Screen is relatively sharp, it may not be retina display, but it is up there. Web browsing or Facebooking is quite comfortable on it. I have no issue using the phone under the sun or indoor (in contrary to Samsung Intercept).Performance: I can play most of the Android games smoothly (i.e. Angry Bird, Where's my water, etc.) I have yet to have a chance to try out 3D games. All the app runs quite smoothly, including web browsing, facebook, etc. The issue with phone crashes when making/ receiving calls in Intercept is a no issue here. I can listen to music or play Divx videos with no hiccup.4G: it might be a good thing for people in the WiMax coverage area. My area do not have this privilege so I can't test it. One thing I do know is that with 4G on, the battery drains REALLY fast (-25% in an hour) and the phone gets burning hot.Data Speed (*NOT THE PHONE ISSUE*): Since this phone has a medium-high hardware spec, I am more certain now that Virgin Mobile has obsolete data speed comparing to other no contract phones such as Straight Talk which offers true 3G. With SpeedTest App, I get 0.3 mbps or NO SPEED in sub urban area (Greensboro, NC), while my StraightTalk on iPhone 4 gets 3~5 mbps constantly. The slow speed definitely affect the experience when web browsing or facebooking.If you are an avid Virgin Mobile and Android user, I will definitely recommend this phone. If you only need a fast smartphone for texting or calling, then this is the phone for you. Otherwise, if data speed is a main concern, I would not recommend Virgin Mobile AT ALL. This is a GREAT smartphone for its price range, however, you can only use Virgin Mobile thus making this phone somewhat useless.","December 4, 2012",1
mobile phone,Pretty good for the price---not perfect.,jwb/nyc,R2BRUIX99RV7V8,3,"I'm not sure if it's the Virgin service or the phone. But when I dial a call it doesn't go through.Sometimes I have to dial 3 times. I also get cut out. And touch screens can be tricky, I accidently email, text, dial, very irritating. But it has many more options than I'm used to which is great. I wish Virgin offered a similiarly priced Blackberry. Hopefully that will return.Though for the price, and it's not the cost of an Iphone, it is pretty good. I don't like the idea of a contract and for about $60.00per month, I get unlimited phone service. The quality is better than my old LD phone.I felt it was the best option for me on a limited budget.","December 4, 2012",1
mobile phone,Nice Phone - Excellent Price (UPDATED 1/2013),"Amazon Customer ""rumbledolly""",RPODDHPW3YJFD,3,"Just received this phone (Net10 ver. which should be the same)to replace my aging LG. Worked pretty easy right out of the box. Very very easy WiFi set up - done within minutes just by walking through the steps the phone gives. Not sure why quite a few posters have had issues with it. Follow the steps people!Setting up gmail account was just as easy though I won't use it for email unless I'm on WiFi since why would I want to use up minutes to check email unless I have no choice and am not in a hotspot.Downloaded Opera Mini as my browser. I do wish I could move it out of my games folder but I can't find a way. Not a biggie. I've downloaded a few ring tones and a game via Opera and I've also set up my FB & Twitter accounts though again I won't be using them much on this phone it's still, like email, nice to have. The internet is fairly fast on WiFi, especially compared to my old LG which used the tracfone/net10 browser with no WiFi. I have been able to go into my G+ account easily and also my calendar which is nice.Keyboard easy to use - my only beef is the zero on the number pad portion is in a awkward place for me but once I'm used to it I'm sure I'll be fine. I did have to recheck the numbers I entered into the phone to be sure I didn't mess them up. I was able to take my memory card out of my LG and move it into the phone but couldn't get most of my numbers off the card. Apparently you need to download PC Studio and I didn't really want to so I entered most manually. It took a bit of time but did help me get used to the key placement.Two things I don't like about the phone and I can't find a way to change it...yet... Text messages appear as just a standard ""you have a message"". My old LG displayed a caller ID if the person was in my phone book. This helped save minutes because if the number was unfamiliar or the area code was not in my region I could pretty much bet that the call was spam or a wrong number and I could delete without paying for the used minutes. I can't seem to figure out how to do this with the Samsung. I did go in and click on Anonymous reject and Ad reject but it doesn't help with those people who send you drunk texts messages and can't get it through their thick heads you're not the person they are looking for!I also do not care for the back of the phone. I know picky picky but I do find it very slippery, especially if my hands are cold. It looks great and one would think the texture would help but it doesn't. I can't find a cover or skin for it. I'm thinking about using some rubberized colored tape to make a line across the back for easier grip. A gel cover would be great though!All and all the phone works great so far and was very easy to set up just be going through the settings menu (the guide with the phone is pretty useless unless you've never had a cell phone before and most online guides are not much better). I understand some people have had issues with the phone and my gut tells me there is a defective batch out there. If you have issues I think returning it before the warranty is up is probably the best course of action.For the price this is an excellent phone. Prepaid companies really should have this as their ""go to phone"". Even if I only get a year out of it I've still saved money and I'm not a slave to a contract. I've been using prepaid phones for 2 years (and using my old Droids as mini-lap tops when traveling via WiFi) and I don't think I'll ever go back to anything with a contract. I pay $30 a month with roll-over minutes - can't beat that!UPDATE 1/20/2013....I am no longer using this phone. The annoying habit that it has (and other people commented about) of dialing 911 every time it's in my purse or jacket pocket became too much to take. The 911 operators were tired of hearing from me. I was very lucky they were not dispatching PD to my home. It became embarrassing. Just one push of the phone while it was supposedly locked was all it took to dial. It made no sense for me to have the phone on me but off. I live in an area where you can go from suburban to rural in minutes and in the winter you never know when you're going to have an emergency - like sliding off a snow or ice covered road. I didn't need to worry about the phone being off and no one able to locate me. While the phone is still a decent phone until this problem is fixed in a newer version I wouldn't suggest it to anyone who might have it in a purse or pocket. I switched to Ting Mobile and really enjoy the service and the great phone I purchased from them.","October 19, 2012",1
mobile phone,good little phone for the cheap price. so you get what you pay for,Audrey,R2RQCX3DPLQJ6F,3,the phone like the seller said was new and i recieved it fast that i do like. the phone is slightly better then my other vm phone since it has more internal memory smaller design slightly larger screen the camera has flash and its running android 4.0. the downside though and im geussing thats because of the maker kyocera. is that this phone unlock my old one freezes up when running apps closes me out of the browser at random with is crashes and sometimes when using the keypad and trying to input a numbwe by using the fn to change to numeral setting and back. it wont change over.like in the top part when i referred to the android it was running i had to go to the screen keyboard. it happens at random but i feel performace wise my older phone was better. this one just happened to have a few features and slimmer design but performance horribly. glad i bought it cheap here and not the other places like the vm site that was asking more.i plan to upgrade again soon and ive only had it a little over a month.g,"January 29, 2014",1

mobile phone,Great phone but no 3g,Lisa C. Hunter,R1SF5X6RBCQU85,3,"I bought this phone from Citrus llc and used prime, received it the next day. It came with 2 batteries, cover, headphones and instruction manual. I took my time researching this phone before I bought it. I had even ordered it once and canceled due to some of the bad reviews here but then decided it was worth the risk. The phone powered up perfectly, display is beautiful, and everything seems to be working as it should. Really, you can't tell much difference between this phone and the galaxy. The only thing I'm not impressed with, is that the back cover is a little flimsy. The wifi works wonderfully, after you figure out to get it on. I had to turn it on and then bring up a page before it would connect. This phone does work with straight talk (att) sim. If you buy this phone I suggest you make sure it's through a amazon prime vendor. I can't believe I almost passed this up due to some of the reviews. I've only had it two days, but if any issues arise I will be sure to update. Btw it's very fast and runs games perfectly.****UPDATE**** This phone does not have 3g service. Currently I am using both a t-mobile and att sim with full bars with 3g active and neither pick up 3g, only 2g. I assume the 3g only works in the overseas market.

mobile phone,"A Beautiful Phone, A Fake Galaxy Note","Arawandmenky ""Meandagirls""",R2RDC4ZPACLBT7,3,"This is a beautiful phone. It's like a fake Samsung Galaxy Note (it's actually called, according to the box, ""android note""). I ordered it because I refuse to pay the high $ for the real Galaxy Note or get stuck in another 2-yr contract. Anyway, as I noted, this phone is gorgeous. The problem is, I could not get it to work. It comes with two batteries and an extra battery cover with a plastic case attached to it to shield the screen. The little case is a bit flimsy, but the phone itself is pretty solid and feels good in your hand. I took it out the box, charged it up, popped in my t-mobile sim card and wow, very impressed, it booted right up. An hour later, the screen went black and never came back on. Needless to say, I returned it and got a full refund. My advice, to anyone interested in buying this, after market, phone, chose a seller that use Amazon as his/her shipper and not directly from the seller (which, most of them are in China and outside of the US).

I have made a phone call but no texting yet so idk if everything is working but so far the phone itself is great looking except around the sides their are a few bubbly looking spots randomly on the phone.. also I am having to charge the phone with the charger for my old AT&T; phone because the USB charger hooked into the wall or using the usb hook up wall charger will not charge the phone >.< I wiggled it a little and it charged but than would stop..so my old charger was the same size & should do the trick I hope it's charging on it right now. I ordered EXpress shipping through DHL and givin the phone was in Hong Kong and I am in tennessee it arrived a about 6 or 7 days later compared to the standard 22 days so Kudos to DHL/ Shipping was on time not early but on time for express. The front facing camera is low quality but the back camera is 5MP and seems pretty great! I have yet to figure out how to transfer my contacts I backed up onto my sim card onto the new phone...Hope everybody is having a good day & I PRAY nothing else goes wrong with this phone because it seems pretty damn awesome!

mobile phone,"Phone looks great, but I can' get service to work.",Cindy,R2WUXU8BLU3D6S,3,"I purchased this phone on Amazon. The phone is big, bright and responsive to the touch I then purchased a ATT SIM card for Straight Talk on Amazon. I inserted the SIM and the phone recognized it. I then contacted Straight Talk to set up service and port my current phone number from my old Verizon phone to this new phone and SIM card. According to Straight Talk and the SIM seller, the SIM is active with my phone number, however, the phone is not picking up any cell service at all. I have been emailing and talking with Straight Talk and the SIM provider for a few days with no luck. I don't know if it is the phone or SIM. I think I would love the phone if I could get the cellular service to work. Has anyone had this issue? If so, how did you resolve it?","June 7, 2013",1

mobile phone,"Beautiful phone with great call quality, however too much bloatware inlcuded by Samsung and warranty is not offered globally.",Matrix,R3P31MSNRLC5S8,3,"This is a great phone. Large screen, bright display and is very fast. Great call quality, especially the speaker phone. I cannot stop using this phone. Unfortunately, the phone only gets three stars to two reasons:1. Warranty and support is not available in North America where this phone is used. If Samsung is selling unlocked world phone, they should honour the warranty anywhere, as long as the customer can produce proof of purchase. And why is Samsung bowing to the Telcos and not releasing unlocked phones in North America? Hopefully, I will not have to deal with warranty issues, but I don't see this going well if I do.2. All the bloatware Samsung include with the phone. There are tons and tons of apps I will never use. Why not give customers the option to remove apps that is of no interest to them. These take up precious memory that you cannot reclaim. Painstakingly disable each app is not sufficient. There should be a uninstall option with no reinstall with future OS upgrades. The only plus is this unlocked phone has slightly less bloatware than a phone purchased from a Telco.Upon receiving the phone, I thought it would definitely be a five star product. After turning it on, I was immediately disappointed with all the crap on the screen and no option to remove them. Thankfully, the phone is still usable (after disabling most of the included apps) and the call quality is great.","December 9, 2013",1

The e-mail and other features are not well designed nor easily accessible. The customer service is ATROCIOUS AND COMPLICATED!. It's like a mentally challenged chimpanzee is in charge. I needed to buy an additional $10 minute package for my value plan because of recent higher than usual usage. Couldn't do it through the phone, on the website or by calling them. I made five attempts for this simple purchase. Pin numbers didn't match, purchase options on the phone didn't match my plan, and the website only gave me the option to cancel not purchase.

I like the touchscreen feature and that it has WiFi and Bluetooth capability. Did not come with a car charger. It has a Proximity Sensor in the upper right had corner of the screen, (not visible). The sensor will turn the screen off when you bring the phone to your ear and back on when you remove the phone from your ear. Make sure that if you get a screen protector that it has the cutout for this sensor otherwise the screen will go blank when you make a call and you'll have to power cycle the phone to get back the screen.

Additionally to magnify the screen you can not touch expand, there is a icon to select to magnify the screen for each screen being viewed. In the browser a selection for landscape is available. Also the on-screen, keypad doesn't come up when needed for data entry on WiFi browsing. The telephone keypad comes up and you must press buttons forever to enter data. WiFi works in a pinch but is difficult to navigate with no screen keyboard other than the telephone type keypad. Screen visibility of web pages does not have resolution of smart phones.Texting is fine with the keyboard appearing in the landscape mode. Having said these shortcomings. I must confess I have not used this phone exclusively yet so observations of limitations might change once the time expires on the LG400 and I begin using LG840 exclusively. So bottom line so far is: use as a phone is good, the auto shut down of the screen prevents 911 calling by accident, Texting is OK but lack of screen auto rotating to landscape and a screen keyboard for all apps is a real pain.","June 11, 2013",1
mobile phone,Nice phone with a few exceptions...,E. Richards,R1QJKUDI8E0XCY,3,"Overall, this is a decent phone. I bought it because Tracfone had refurbished models for 10$ and my keyboard on my other phone was kind of glitchy making texting a pain, so I thought I'd give it a try for that price. Basics: It has triple minutes (I buy 1500 tripling to 4500 once a year.) It is touch screen- no slide out keyboard which I wish it did have. Camera, video, works on GSM (AT&T;) towers. Wifi, bluetooth, a couple apps a 2GB micro SD card for music. It has a nice large screen that is easy to use and see, similar to using an iPod touch.Texting: this is basically what I use a phone for. You can make SMS texts up to 5 pages long, it sends them as so many pages but you don't have to start a new text every 160 characters. You can add a picture, music, video or other files to SMS texts, otherwise it will send them as SMS rather than MMS, it doesn't give you a choice which kind you want to send beforehand. As usual with tracfone you don't get to see who's texting you until you open it. I don't really like the touchscreen keyboard, I keep hitting the wrong keys. Also when you try to scroll through stuff like templates it's nearly impossible because every time you touch the screen it thinks you're selecting something. It has autocorrect, but I have that turned off. It's useful to have a stylus.Calling: If you live in an area with good AT&T; coverage calls are fine.Browser: I don't use this because it takes up tons of minutes and most websites don't actually work or show up correctly because there's not a real operating system. Works fine to check email or facebook messages though.Camera: Camera is 2MP but doesn't take great pictures. There's no zoom, unless you are using a low resolution, which is silly, why would you want to take low res photos to be able to zoom? There are lots of adjustable features, however, such as brightness, white balance, night mode, color effects like mono, sepia, negative, blue, a timer, normal or continuous shot mode. Plus you can edit pictures you've taken or downloaded with frames, flip, rotate, resize, add an image like a crown or a heart etc. to the photo, change the colors, adjust brightness, contrast, hue etc., add a filter such as sharpen, emboss, water color, sketch, neon, cartoon etc., draw with a pen, add text, crop, or add a stamp. You can also print via bluetooth.Video: Basically the same settings the camera has to take the video, plus the ability to zoom.Functions: Screen locks after a set period of time (you can adjust the amount of time) You push a button to turn the phone back on, and slide the lock up to unlock the screen. There's a ""home"" button at the bottom left on the screen. You can set contacts to shortcut to from the main screen, and you can set shortcuts to the widgets like email or messaging. There are also 4 buttons in a bar on the bottom of the home screen to make calls, go to contacts, go to texts or go to the widgets screen. You can scroll through widgets using this bar, or click on the apps button to go to the apps screen. If you don't want to add a widget to your shortcuts but want to easily access it for a period of time, you can slide it from the bar up to your wallpaper and it will stick on the main screen until you slide it back to the bar. These widgets include prepaid, where your phone/minutes info is located, contacts, messages, dialing, recent calls, games, calendar, camera, video camera, alarm, browser, settings where you can change the display, call, phone, and touch settings and sounds, email, SNS (facebook, twitter, myspace), voice recorder, file manager (photos, videos, music), pictures, music player, notepad, audio, video, sound settings, wi-fi, bluetooth, calculator, tip calculator, stopwatch, unit converter and tasks.Ringtones: You can add your own ringtones, but for some reason you are limited on file size. I put several ringtones on the phone that I'd had on my other phone, and all but 4 of them were blocked from being set as ringtones because the file size was too large, even though they were only about 16 seconds long and I'd used them as ringtones before. On my old phone, I kept the volume set at medium. I have this phone set all the way up and I can still barely hear it when I play the ringtones. It seems loud enough when the alarm goes off though.Contacts: You can add photo ids and ringtones and emails etc for specific contacts. But unlike every other phone I've ever used you have to crop the photo to a little square. You can move the square where you want on the photo, but you don't get to resize it the size of the square is what you get. Which is annoying. There are message and call icons next to the contact name in the list, so you don't have to click on them to send them stuff. And, as I said, you can add your frequent contacts to the shortcut on the home page and not have to go into contacts at all.Bluetooth: This works fine, I transferred several files between the phone and my computer as well as my other phones and had no problems.Case: I got a case because I like the colors, but you really don't need one for this phone. The screen isn't covered by a case anyway, and the back cover is textured so you don't see scratches or fingerprints for the most part. And a case is only going to give you minimal breakage protection.Battery: I still have a full charge though I've been playing with the phone for a few days. But I'm not a heavy user so I don't know how long it lasts with frequent calls/ texts because I just got it.There are tap sounds when you touch things on the touch screen that you can turn off or change.When you enter info into contacts etc, the default entry method is keypad, but you can change it to keyboard. You can also add things to your dictionary and change between English and Spanish languages.Managing calls: One of the reasons I liked the AT&T; phones I've had on tracfone was the ability to block numbers from calling or texting me, so I didn't keep getting the same sales calls etc. This phone does not have the option to do that. And the lack of that feature when it was on the other phones knocked it down a star, because it was one of the two selling points for choosing AT&T; over Verizon, along with being able to create multiple page SMS texts, if the network works equally well for both in your area.So overall, it seems like a decent phone. If you like touchscreen keyboards, AT&T;, and don't care about being able to block numbers (which you can't do on the Verizon phones either) or take good pictures, you should like it, especially if you get the refurbished phone for 10$. It has a 3 month return window and a 1 year warranty. Though it is quite disappointing to ""upgrade"" your phone after 2 years and have to take a step backwards in functionality on many of the uses. If you've never had any of the things this phone lacks, however, you'll probably be a lot more pleased with it.","September 9, 2013",1
mobile phone,The phone performs well. Transfering old phone/service with Tracfone to the new was difficult.,Thomas Wiegand,RXYT5Y5DSOB7L,3,"The LG 840G is an excellent product. The 1200 minutes received with purchase were outstanding, and paid for the phone itself. Triple minutes at purchase of future minutes is great. I received my phone on a Saturday and around noon began the process of transferring the service on my old Tracfone to the new LG 840G. The transfer hung up in Tracfone's system for a day an half before clearing. That left my old phone without service, and the new phone in limbo. It could be that Tracfone has weekend problems with system support. Regardless, it left me in without a phone for a day and a half.","August 17, 2013",1

His was old & needed updating & we chose this phone with touch screen for easier use for him. Arrived on Mon. and spent all week trying to activate it, only to find out yesterday that the sim card will not work in our area. Perhaps I am at fault for not researching that, but wish Amazon had furnished information to cover that problem. Would have saved a lot of anxiety. Fortunately TracFone is sending us a new phone that will work in our area. As far as the phone is concerned I LOVE IT! Watched youtube demo also, has a lot of nice features.

mobile phone,LG840G Tracfone with 1200 minutes loaded,"Michael J. Richards ""O2B_Free""",R3JPIE14SZ6C8Z,3,"WHen I first turned on the phone I got a message that the SIM card was not recognized. After shutting down the phone and turning it back on 5 times (or so) I finally got the home screen. I called Tracfone and they helped me transfer my number from another Tracfone and said they would send me a new LG840G. It took about 3 weeks to get the new phone and I had to call again to find out why it was taking so long but finally got the new phone which seems fine. The LG840G was a bit confusing to me since you cannot get your voicemails by clicking on messages (apparently that is for text messages only but simply says ""messages"". You have to click the ""Dialing"" shortcut until a number keypad comes up and then hold the number one key until the phone dials in your voicemail telling you if you have messages and then playing the messages if any. I never would have this out without help from Tracfone and they had to look it up while I listened to music for 10 minutes. If you want to silence the ringtone for movies and such you have to go to a shortcut called ""sounds"" it took me forever to stumble on that since my other phones had this option under ""settings"". Overall the phone does have a nice feel to it (although it can be slippery) and it is a triple minute phone which is nice. The LG840G is said to be as close to an android phone as you will get in a prepaid phone. There are a few youtube reviewsbut not many and they do not cover the things I mentioned in this post (things that seem ectremely important to me). This is a goood phone for the money and the 1200 minutes make it a great value. If you dont mind going through what I did go fo it maybe you will be luckier then I was. I am finally happy with the phone now.","January 7, 2013",1
mobile phone,Seemed great in the beginning but...,"J. Elliott ""book raven""",R1JGEI4HOGWFVX,3,"I bought this LG phone to replace a seven year old Motorola Tracfone that had bit the dust but still had a lot of minutes. I wanted the features of a smartphone but without the monthly bills that usually come with it. This seemed to have all I needed plus 3g and wifi.The good points: Ive had it for three months now and it has been a reliable phone. The apps are easy to learn (transitioning from a push button phone menu anyway) and if you already have an iPod its a synch. The apps are ok; calculator address book, notepad, calculator, calender, voice recorder, music player, web browser, a weak video camera, Facebook, Twitter and My Space access and Bluetooth. Tower reception is usually better than most of my friends have with their smart phones in ""dead zones.""The not so hot: The 3g will EAT up your points! I use the wifi wherever I can to avoid having to buy more minutes. I don't use this phone as my primary method of web surfing while I'm on the go, but I found that just a few minutes of surfing the web and looking for a ringtone or a game to buy will really chew at your prepaid points level. Also this phone does not have Android, you cant get the variety of apps like you can on a smartphone or an apple device. That said, buying games and ringtones will also cost you prepaid points and the selection is limited and disappointing. I also didn't like the menus for all these ""features"" and it took forever to search and find what I wanted (another reason to use the wifi.) I also find i need to charge it more than my old phone, all the features run the battery down fast.Overall its a nice phone if you are on a budget but still want the feel of a smart phone or if your teenager is looking for his or her first phone. The phone is inexpensive and the prepaid minutes are easier on the wallet than a $50 and up cell phone plan. If you are like me and don't use enough minutes to warrant getting one of those ""family unlimited plans"" and don't care about missing out on the android apps than this phone is a good pick.","August 17, 2013",1

My old phone (worked with Verizon towers) got great reception and this one works well in some areas but not others, always losing bars. Tracfone should have said it was an AT&T; phone, but they just say wheather or not it will work in your area when you check on their site.","April 25, 2014",1

But what really made me rate this( I'd give it 2 1/2 stars if possible) is the reliability . I've owned this three weeks and twice it would not let me receive or send texts until I took the battery out and put it back again. Then I had no service for about five hours earlier this week, while my other tracfone worked perfectly all that day, so it wasn't a tracfone service problem but I think a phone problem.

Best part of the deal it's supercheap for service. I cancelled my Verizon service on my droid phone and saved a bundle. I can still use my droid at home for free on wifi for facebook, email, web, and a free text app. Yes I have 2 phone numbers, 1 for my text app on my droid and 1 for the tracfone.

mobile phone,Phone is fine but TracFone customer service is not!!,Kathy,R22RBA9P9WRI7K,3,"I bought this phone because it was inexpensive and I wanted a starter phone for my 11 year old daughter. Although the phone itself is fine you're out of luck if you ever lose it and try to call TracFone for help. They're useless! I called them to report it lost and to find out how many minutes were left on it (does not give you this info on your online account) because I would have bought another phone and transferred the minutes to it. After 30 minutes on the phone with them, getting nowhere, I decided I won't be buying from them again. Their ""procedure"" (if you can call it that), is to make you ""guess"" the number of minutes you had left, then they put you on hold multiple times while someone else approves or disapproves your guess. Huh?! I guessed 200 minutes (originally started at 100 but the agent told me to guess higher!) as I had no idea how many were left, since it was my daughter's phone. After the lengthy waiting period the agent came back and told me they would approve a transfer of that many (200) minutes to a new phone. I said what if I'd guessed higher and why can't they tell me exactly what's left? He said all they could do was approve/disapprove the guess. Basically, I could potentially have had 600 left (started with 1200, after all and was lost 7 months later) and they would have screwed me out of the extra 400 I had already paid for because I guessed too low - what a bunch of crooks!","December 2, 2013",1

I skipped the LG800 due to many poor reviews but felt the LG840G would be better. For the most part the phone works as advertised. The exception, its, or my, inability to have it work properly with my Toyota ""Hands Free"" Phone/GPS system, not an after market unit. The 840 replaced a LG420G which worked fine in the same car. I used the same setup procedure, removing the old phone to avoid any conflict. It connects but works very erratically or, not at all, on the oft chance it does work, its usually with the system on 'Manual"" not hands free (voice activated). While connected to the car's system the phone will not operate on its own as a hand held unit while in range. The Toyota system will not allow manually operation while the vehicle is in motion.Although new and without much history it seems the battery will only last about 5-6 days on standby, less if used occasionally. Lastly, the packaging material/manual states, ""the unit comes with a house charger/adapter with a removable data cable...it did not, just a conventional house charger unit.

mobile phone,Not great not too bad,Eli,RY3WDOVT2F6EO,3,"As a BASIC phone it is OK, but just OK. I read many great reviews before buying this, don't know why anybody would rave about it, it works as a phone nothing more. You can check email so long as the email is basic, you can't access work email no way to configure that.It has several features I really like, among them the voice recorder and wi-fi.It has one mayor design flaw, when entering data into the contacts list, one must touch the same key for 'A', 'B' and 'C' this goes on with each letter, so if you want to type 'Charles' instead of six (as it should be) it requires eighteen key strokes.The phone turns itself off almost immediately, you can't pause to do anything, you must be working with the phone or it will turn itself off. They do this to conserve batteries and there is apparently no way to change this to a normal time like five minutes, it has one minute as the maximum.As far as the carrier Tracphone;-It has designed the system to extract every penny possible out of the user. Each text costs $0.30, IMO that is outrageous, there is no justification for this, at a minimum each time you receive a text it will be the one your received, your text acknowledging it and their response. So, each text exchange is $0.90 If you do text two people at once they charge for each text separately.-I had my number of over five years prior to switching to Tracphone, never, not once did I get a robocall of some sort. Two days after activating this number with Tracphone the robocalls begun, as of today, I have received more robocalls than calls from people in my contact list. These robocalls always leave messages and checking those messages will cost you money.-Tracphone eliminates the time bought, you have to call them to get the minutes you paid for reinstated. IMO this can't be a bug on their system, if it was, you would also get extra minutes added not just subtracted from your paid for minutes, that never happens.------------Is it worth buying? If you intend to have a phone to make calls and nothing else, yes. You must ignore all incoming calls from robocalls (folks not in your contact list), and never use the text option. If you will be browsing the net, sending/receiving text messages, playing on-line etc. then absolutely not. It would be considerably cheaper for you if you were to get a regular plan with T-Mobile or AT&T.;","April 17, 2013",1
mobile phone,"Good Phone, but For the Same Price, Nexus 4 is MUCH BETTER",Unedited Justice,R3MHC7NTE3JIMO,3,"I got this phone because it was top rated on amazon, and I can see why it earned that reputation--it is a solid device. Immediately after ordering, however, I learned about LG's Nexus 4 (sold on Google's Play Store). The Nexus 4 has more than twice as powerful a processor, twice as much RAM, a screen that's almost twice as good, a camera that's about 1.5 times as good, and the latest version of android ready. The 8gb model is going for $300, and the 16gb model is going for $350 (remember to buy this device from the google play store, it's actually significantly cheaper than amazon). The only downside to the nexus 4 is that it has no sd card support, but if that's of no concern to you, I highly recommend it over this device.","August 4, 2013",1

mobile phone,"Battery Life, Drop Outs",Kindle Customer,R250IDXDOLHQJ3,3,"Good -1) Delivery prompt and in excellent condition.2) Display excellent.3) Feature rich.4) Full User's manuals in various languages available on the manufacturers site.5) The language switch over from German easy and a non-issue. And no, I don't read German.6) Apps, like GasBuddy, easy to install and work well in large metro areas.7) Overall comparable to my work iPhone with exceptions noted below.Bad -1) Charging overnight last from ~6AM - ~3PM with WiFi and GPS off, brightness @50% with less than 1 hour of talk time. Repeated these results for several days; never achieved acceptable battery life. This was THE deal breaker.2) The dropouts and lack of service could be poor carrier service - AT&T;'s GSM. Often had NO service with 3 bars. Signal strength varied >10db with the phone sitting on a table, no known local EM interference, and fair WX. When traveling, one needs good coverage - not excellent, just good. This phone/carrier combo did NOT deliver minimally acceptable service.Other thoughts -1) 3-star (neutral) rating because of the uncertainties involved.2) Possibly a one-off lemon on the phone, but I don't play roulette - hoping the next spin will be a winner.3) Case/cover and screen protectors I ordered/received are a loss.4) Amazon refund prompt and hassle free. This was the only bright spot in the deal.","July 12, 2013",1
mobile phone,Beware Using in the USA but this is a very nice full featured phone,Sharon555,RPYNC1XVYY6RM,3,"This is a great phone feature wise. I have a samsung galaxy S4 and I use AT&T; in the USA. It function a tad slower but overall its great when I ran it on WIFI. For the price its outstanding it almost performs as well as my galaxy S4. I gave it 3 stars based on its functionality and if you do not care about data rate when not on WIFI. I think the issue is the same on T-Mobile in the USA But do not know that first hand. What I do know first hand is that on AT&T;, I spent hours with them, and could only get Edge to work. 3G did pop up sometimes for a few seconds. The issue is that it is a GSM phone and will work well as a phone and EDGE. For data these models do not support the frequencies requires for 3G 850/1900 it has 900/1900. You will only get EDGE rates and for a smartphone that is unacceptable this why I took off two stars. it will work fine just slow away from WIFI. I did have other issues but those were unit specific I did not let those affect my rating as it was defective not intrinsic to the product. This is a very nice product just not on AT&T; as a minimum.","February 8, 2014",1

That is the limit of my services because it does not appear to be ""Unlocked"". There are some instructions in German that do not change over to English. It came set up for use with T-Mobile. Therefore I have to keep my data services off to avoid excessive charges from T-Mobile and Google connections. I was forced to set up Gmail which is locked into the phone. I've tried to delete it via bookmarks, but it doesn't help.It should not have taken me this long to get to the bottom of my problems.

The phone arrived the awaited day which I consider to be an excellent fact. Only two or three things do not allow my absolute satisfaction at this time. First, the charger plug was not what I expected. I expected to receive a plug that can be used in the United States with voltage of 110v. The one I recived was intended to be used at Middle East countries. I also expected Spanish (my native language) to be one of the phone's default language, besides English of course, so I have to download the language addon. Another point to mention is that while on the phone box (as at Amazon's Order page) is printed the phone have 8GB of Internal Memory, the properties of Android system reflects the phone's Internal Memory is barely 4.55 Gb.

Not too bent out but a bit annoyed.ADDENDA. Finally got the phone No complaints about the phone itself so farPhone arrived in factory sealed condition.All components present and accounted for. Battery for instance was a sealed in package Samsung stock battery. So that was fine.opened it up, added my old SIM card and battery, turned on and everything AOK. Power at 20% so charging as one should always do. Did not take long to charge to 50%. Checked out a few things. got the bluetooth to talk with my plantronics, checked out a few things. Bit of a learning curve on my part although I do have the Kindle tablet that intro'd me to Android.Cute phone. Got the CIMO cover for it. Have more instructions to read. The S Voice looked nice but they want pretty much all of your information if you do. Not too comfy with that yet. Maybe later. GPS not the paragon of precision although this may be a Google map issue. Showed the location to be about 500+ feet (about half a block) from actual location so would not use it for semi precise guidance. Tried the FM radio. Good for fairly strong stations.Big complaint about the phone loudness for the FM Radio. AUDIO LEVEL at lowest setting, 1, is TOO LOUD!!!! WTF!!!!! Do they have deaf people in their testing labs? Fer crying out loud I am 59, had my ears blown out by everyone from Steppenwolf to the Dead Kennedys in the basement of a student Co-op. This is ridiculous. Turning down system audio level does not help. Cannot use standard 3 contact stereo headphone jacks. Uses a 4 contact one.11/14/13Well just realized that the GPS probably hasn't been on most of the time I have used it. SO the question is the GPS broken or is it a function of the 4.1.1 OS. May upgrade to 4.1.2 manually.Several other things, this is a Brit version so no domestic support. with AT&T; that may include not upgrading the phone to 4.1.2 KIES won't do it because it has the wrong version of firmware.

mobile phone,"Large Screen In Slim, Elegant Body - Replaced By Moto G",Alan Houston,R3BX3NWRZNYX3X,3,"The LG Venice is a good phone limited by the slow Boost Mobile 3G network because it is NOT a 4G LTE phone and it can not connect to the high speed Boost 4G LTE network. As of May 2014, the Venice has been replaced in the Boost lineup by the MUCH better Motorola Moto G, which is a 3G phone with a sharper screen, faster processor, and the newest Android software.If your neighborhood is served by the Boost 4G LTE network, do NOT buy the 3G Venice, instead buy a Boost 4G LTE phone that has ten times faster data speeds. If your neighborhood does not have 4G, buy the much newer, much better 3G Moto G, which is the best 3G phone in the Boost lineup.The Venice runs all my favorite apps, such as Pandora Radio (using 3g) and Netflix (using wi-fi). The Venice has a single core processor, so it is NOT the best phone for demanding 3D action games.The front speaker is adequate when you are making a phone call in a quiet room, but can be shrill at maximum volume. The rear speaker sounds good at moderate volume levels, but becomes harsh when turned up to a loud volume.Music sounds great through high quality headphones or when streaming to a good bluetooth speaker.The rear camera takes good (not great) photos and adequate quality videos in bright sunlight. On cloudy days and indoors photos sometimes have muddy colors, with poor contrast and will lack sharpness. Locking the camera at ISO 100 outdoors and at ISO 200 indoors improves photo quality.Battery life can be great. You can get up to 24 hours per charge when you are using the LG power control bar on the drop down notification screen to turn OFF 3g, wifi, bluetooth, and GPS until they are actually needed. I turn on wifi a few times a day to download Gmail and check the news and weather, then I turn wifi back off.The pull-down power bar lets you ""click"" the screen brightness to 100% for outdoors and back to 50% level indoors, which greatly increases battery life. If you are watching Netflix at night, a brightness setting of just 20% work well and extends battery life.Using GPS navigation with 3G will drain your battery in about three hours. Connect the Venice to a high quality car charger (such as the Motorola fast charger) if you use GPS for more than an hour or two a day.Cases and Batteries: The LG Venice uses the same cases and batteries as do its siblings, the LG L7, and LG Splendor.Best Cases: Search Amazon for ""Black Perforated Hybrid Case"" for the LG Venice and LG L7.For MAXIMUM drop protection, which requires a thick, bulky, heavy case, search for ""Ballistic SG LG L7"" case or ""Ballistic SG LG Splendor case.BOOST MOBILE COVERAGE MAP: Before you buy any Boost Mobile phone, carefully study the coverage map at the Boost Mobile website. The map enables you to zoom in for a block by block view of signal strength, to see the quality of the Boost signal on the block where you live and work. There is ZERO Boost coverage in some states, and ZERO Boost coverage in most rural area. Check the coverage map carefully before you buy any Boost Mobile phone.","February 17, 2013",1

The first one would not charge dependably nor hold a charge. I didn't wait around to find out what the problem was, I promptly sent for a replacement. Amazon sent out a new one immediately; I didn't have to wait to send the old one back. The process was rather easy - credit Amazon.When I got the new one I noticed that some things were different which led me to believe that the first one I got was NOT NEW! The first one: did not have an sd card, the battery was already in the phone and the decal on the outside-back of the battery cover was not there - All different with the new phone.So I am guessing that the first one was refurbished, used or something of the sort.

The phone would be in my shirt pocket and when I pull it out to check something (because there is no notification light) I realize the phone is off.

I have pressed the power button for extended periods and it still wont turn on unless I pull the battery: something I expect from a blackberry, NOT my NEW Samsung S3 mini.

mobile phone,Beware!!! Amazon False advertisement!,Cloud,R2ZGQP1P2XLF3V,3,"If you are buying this from Amazon and looking for NFC variant, be sure to choose the specific Seller that specifically says that they carry the NFC version. Although the Amazon product technical specs will say it has NFC but not all seller sells the NFC version. They are pretty much the same price but I'm one of the unlucky ones that just click on the first available seller and gotten the non-NFC version. Grrrr... Not very happy about that because I specifically picked this phone because of the NFC capability technical specs on Amazon... And this is a phone for my wife. I have the S3 (it's bigger brother) and the NFC feature would have allow us to transfer and share media with much eased.PROS: The phone has great power for its small size. As a gear head for high tech devices, for this price I would have chosen the better performance of the Nexus 4 but this phone is not for me. This is for my wife (not too concern with performance) and she wants a smaller phone. She wants the best performance phone at a much smaller size. So... S3 mini is the best bet (without resorting to the iPhone). Although this phone carries a no name CPU, this phone out of the box this phone will score around 3000 on quadrant which is beats the performance of many full size phones (such as the galaxy nexus, Galaxy S2,LG optimus 2X, etc). One thing Amazon forgot to mentioned is it's awesome gorilla glass which make the screen scratch resistant. That is definitely a very nice feature to have. Speakers are also very load for its size and battery life is awesome.CONS: It comes with Touchwiz and I'm not a Touchwiz fan but you can download your own launcher. The storage space is also small. Althought it is 8GB, it is only around 4GB usable space so don't look to install a lot of apps and games. This phone is for my wife and she is mostly concern with pictures and music. Pictures, music, and non-app files can be stored on micro SD card so this 4GB internal storage is plenty of room for her. If you want to install a lot of apps and games, consider the 16GB version.Looks very similar to S3. Performance is not at par with the regular S3 but it's very impressive for a small phone. I would have given 5 stars if not for the False advertisement. To send it in will cost me extra money and extra hassle so I'm just stuck with the non-NFCphone.","March 28, 2013",1

mobile phone,"Solid smartphone, smooth OS *2014 UPDATE*",T. Tozawa,R1I56YMU6YOL21,3,"*UPDATES AT THE BOTTOM*I switched from the iPhone 4 to Lumia 920 so if you're in the same situation and deciding whether to try a different OS/phone hopefully this review aids you in making a decision.I've been an iPhone user for a few years now starting from the 3GS and upgrading to the iPhone 4. I skipped the 4S in anticipation of the iPhone 5 but for me, it didn't seem like too big of a change (played with my brother's iPhone 5 for a bit) so I ended up keeping the iP4. The iP4 did everything that I wanted in a smartphone; I am not a heavy user but used it for your basic text, email, web/media browsing, and used a handful of apps, along with a jailbreak to customize certain features. But I was itching to try something new and the Lumia 920 piqued my interest.Since I'm into DSLR photography the PureView camera and optical stabilization intrigued me. I've done a few test shots and overall, the quality is great, especially with low light capture, and the optical stabilization is a great feature. As of now (Nov. 14, 2012) there is some talk of soft photos but nothing extreme, and it seems that Nokia is working on a software update to fix this issue. The half-press of the camera button engages auto focus and the optical stabilization kicks in, just like a DSLR, so usability is excellent. You can also adjust certain settings such as ISO and EV for more creative control.The overall build quality is superb, but with Nokia, that's pretty standard. The screen is bright and beautiful and watching HD content is a pleasure. The matte finish of the black feels great and looks sophisticated, but of course for the more adventurous there are more color options to choose from. The main critique of the phone was it's weight and coming from the iP4, it basically feels the same. Of course, if you're comparing it the iP5 or some of the other smartphones it may feel a lot heavier. Personally, I like having the weight as it feels more comfortable to hold and use. Your mileage may vary, but honestly, the weight issue is completely overblown.I was a little worried about the feel of the user interface on Windows Phone 8 after using iOS all these years. But after trying it out, it was pretty much second nature since the general feel and UI is similar to iOS. The customizable live tiles are great for organizing your home screen and keeping you up to date with what you want (and removing things you don't want.) The overall Windows Phone 8 OS is super smooth and quick compared to what I was use to on my iP4, which I already thought was nice and quick. I'm sure that there may be a few nitpicks and features not yet included that may bother certain users and for me, that one feature is the lack of a notification center. It seems that Microsoft couldn't include it in time and hopefully they'll push out an update that'll add this feature.The one thing about switching to the Windows platform that may bother users is of course app selection. It really isn't as bad as others make it out to be though and I would say that 90% of the main apps found on iOS/Android are found on the Microsoft store. Some apps may not be as fully featured (yet) but hopefully with the push of the Windows 8 ecosystem developers will start concentrating more on this platform. As I've read, developers are liking how easy it is to work on the platform so I wouldn't be surprised if in the near future the Microsoft marketplace will become just as robust as it's competitors. If all you download are gaming apps, then I would say that the Apple store definitely has the edge right now. The Apple store does has a lot of junk apps, but if you're looking for variety, the Microsoft marketplace still falls behind in that category at the moment. Personally I don't do a whole of gaming so that doesn't bother me but it may bother others. For any other app, they'll most likely be found on the Windows platform or there'll be a similar app that performs the same functions (and may even be better.)I haven't used the Nokia Music player too much but one glaring feature missing is the ability to scan through a song; you can only fast forward. This can be a deal breaker for some who like to use their smartphone as their sole music player. But other than that, controls are intuitive and the user interface is very solid.Some final points about the phone; the wireless charging is a great feature. Since I always lay my phone down on my computer desk, I can now just plop it down on the charging plate on the desk and it'll charge without fiddling with any cables. Sure it would only takes a few quick seconds to plug a cable in but it's small features like this that add to the phone. Battery life is decent and a full day with normal text, email, web/video browsing, and gaming use I'll be at around 40%. In standby I don't notice the battery draining super quick. There does seem to be some complaints right now of battery drainage but I haven't noticed anything out of the ordinary. Since I'm still new to the phone and constantly playing with it, I'm sure the battery usage can be better if I just used it normally.If you are heavily into the Apple ecosystem it may be a bit tougher to change to a different platform. But the iPhone 4 was my only Apple product so the switch wasn't troublesome by any means. In the end, I have no regrets in changing from the iPhone 4 to the Lumia 920. Sure there may be a few things missing but nothing that I can't adjust to and nothing bad enough to not warrant a review less than five stars. It's a superb phone with an equally amazing OS and using it is a pleasure. Silky smooth, great handling, and easy usability. Microsoft has the resources to make this platform work so I'm not too worried about updates, etc. I also remember my first mobile phone being the Nokia 5110 which was pretty much the equivalent of the iPhone back in the day (in terms of popularity.) Nokia makes great products so I'm not worried about the reliability or quality. Hopefully more users step out of their comfort zones to try something different. I'm glad I did and do not regret my decision at all.*UPDATE (11/25/2012)*I've owned this phone since launch and after using it daily for 2 weeks I have to downgrade my review from 5 stars to 4 stars. The main problem as reported by others is the battery. The first day or two after launch I had no problem with battery drainage. But after a while, I noticed random significant battery drainage during idle. Sometimes I would lose up to 20% in one hour without any change in settings or apps. I tried turning off some features such as NFC, Wi-Fi, etc. but the random battery drainage would continue. Checking the battery setting, I would sometimes get around 15 hours of battery time remaining at 100% and sometimes at around 70% I'll get 11 days of remaining battery time. It seems all over the place.Also, sometimes while charging the battery, it would randomly stop charging. On one occasion I left the phone plugged into the USB charger overnight and when I woke up it was below 10% since it had stopped charging. Another time I used the wireless charger and it did the same thing. I also noticed that the back of the phone would sometimes get abnormally hot while using it and/or charging. I'm aware that using the phone and/or charging can put a load on the battery but it got uncomfortably warm, something I never encountered while using my iPhone 4.Another thing are the live tiles. They're great but seem to work randomly. I know that certain apps only update in certain intervals but the OEM loaded Weather Channel app doesn't seem to update anymore until I go into the app. I had no problems with the app for the first week or so and haven't changed any settings regarding that app so I have no idea what could be wrong with it.There seems to be some problems with the overall OS/firmware that needs to be addressed at this point. I would give it 3.5 stars if I could. Fortunately I have access to a battery charger during my day to day use so I can charge it when I need to, but if you rely on having long battery life without the option of being able to readily charge it, it could be a problem. I really hope Nokia/Microsoft push out an update that fixes this issue soon.*UPDATE (12/03/2012)*Just another update. It's been about a month since I've been using the phone and I still love it. After letting the battery discharge completely once, the battery performance seems to be better and more consistent. I did have one random reboot but generally speaking, in my day to day use, I haven't had any problems. I've gotten so use to the smoothness and speed of the OS that when I sometimes use my iPhone 4 it just doesn't feel like it reacts as quickly. I did originally dock a star after I noticed the battery problems but have bumped it back up since it seems to have stabilized. There are still a handful of apps that I'd love developers to put more effort into or create on the WP8 platform, but for most things I've find other apps or workarounds.I still don't have any regrets on this phone purchase and will update if I have anything else to add.*UPDATE (06/27/2013)*So it's been over half a year and I'm still using and enjoying my Lumia 920. Over time, there's been a few updates and a lot of official apps are starting to hit the marketplace making the user experience better. I'm still eagerly waiting for the Windows Phone Blue update later in the year/next year which should bring a lot good features such as double-tap to wake, FM radio, and hopefully a notification center. Still, at this point in time, my experience using WP8 has overall been good having switched from using iOS for 5+ years.However, just the other day my Lumia 920 developed a vertical cyan line running down the left-hand side of the screen. It seems that several other users have had this problem occur, although they reported it much sooner after buying the phone. I'm sure I could send it out to Nokia but having the downtime is too much of a hassle. For now I'll have to live with it and since new LCD's are going for around $50 I may just go ahead and replace it on my own if it gets to be too much of an annoyance. Nevertheless, I'm disappointed. I know problems can occur but all the previous smartphones I've owned had no problems within the 2-year contract I usually sign up for and to have this phone malfunction within half a year leaves a bad taste.*UPDATE (02/12/14)*There's been a lot of updates to Windows Phone and the latest updates have added some nice features such as ""glance"", ""double-tap"" to wake, etc. The upcoming 8.1 update that'll include a notification center and quick settings should make the OS overall much more solid. After a year and a half the OS has progressed nicely. A lot of apps have been releasing and that void is still filling up nicely. Although, there is still a lack of good support from all developers as iOS and Android still get priority in terms of features.I still feel that WP8 is a great OS and it's evolving nicely but I've personally been aching to switch back to iOS. The breaking point is pretty much that the Lumia 920's camera has now malfunctioned, causing a black screen with unresponsive buttons. A hard reset has done nothing so now the only option would be to get it fixed/replaced. The camera was one of the main selling points of getting this phone so it's a shame. With only a few months left on contract and a slew of new phones coming out, I've pretty much decided to switch back to iOS or try Android at this point. Like I've mentioned before, I've had no problems with my previous smartphones (iPhone 3GS and 4) but in the close to two years of owning this Nokia, the LCD screen has failed and now the camera. I know there'll be a few more manufacturer choices if I wanted to stay with WP8 (Samsung and Sony should have WP8 phones soon), but Nokia is suppose to be the high-end and all these problems leave a bad impression.I've docked a star, making the original 4-star to a 3-star rating for the Lumia 920 because of these problems. It was fun while it lasted and maybe down the road I'll try Windows Phone again since it really is a solid OS.","November 14, 2012",1
mobile phone,"Great hardware, OS has promise but needs work, sync is TERRIBLE",Daniel Peterson,RFCDC75HNOYQK,3,"I'm a big Windows Phone fan. I bought a Focus on the day it came out (and was the only non Microsoft employee in the store buying one). I later moved up to a Lumia 900, which was even better. When Windows Phone 8 and the Lumia 920 were announced, I had made up my mind that THIS was the next phone I was getting.When I got my first Windows Phone I liked the hardware but thought the device had a lot of promise, but that there was a lot of stuff that had gotten dropped on the software side because they simply ran out of time. Unfortunately, with the cutover to the new kernel, I find myself feeling the same way again with Windows Phone 8.The Good:On the hardware side, the Lumia 920 is fantastic. Build quality is very good, and the phone feels like a high quality product. It feels very solid, and while it did initially feel a bit heavier than my Lumia 900, it's honestly not an issue. I haven't gotten my wireless charging plate from AT&T; yet, it's still on back order, but I'm excited about that as well.The screen looks fantastic, everything looks much sharper than the older screens. I'm not sure what the OS is doing to scale older applications, but it looks great. The camera is also quite good, the image stabilization on videos looks great, and it performs quite well in low light.The changes to the live tile setup are actually more useful than I had thought they would be. For the most part, the smaller sized live tiles work exactly like the larger versions, get updated properly with status information (number of new emails, etc) and really do give you a lot more flexibility in terms of arranging the home screen.I was a little worried that the change from Bing to Nokia maps would be a bit awkward, as I particularly enjoyed the Bing Maps routing based on the traffic. Overall I've been impressed by the new maps apps, and drive has worked great for turn by turn navigation.There's a lot of other little tweaks here in there in the OS that fix some of the silly little annoyances I noticed about Windows Phone 7 (text selection is much easier now, you can multi-delete text message threads, etc).The Meh:Honestly, other than the start screen changes, most of the major OS changes on the phone seem to be behind the scenes. Other than the hardware differences and the start screen, my day to day Windows Phone experience really hasn't changed substantially with the upgrade.The new features that do exist seem like they really weren't usability/focus tested with real world use cases. Kids corner is a great idea, that I haven't seen elsewhere. Unfortunately, if you put a password on your phone to unlock it, it also password locks kids corner as well, with no way to disable that behavior. Maybe that made sense to someone, but it's left a lot of the rest of us scratching our heads.It's still early, but there's not really much in the way of apps taking advantage of the new features that did make it into this release. THere's also a number of Windows Phone 7 apps that simply don't appear in the store if you're running Windows Phone 8 because they aren't compatible (including ones I've purchased). Presumably both of these will go away over time, but for people buying now, it's an issue.The ""app gap"" between Windows Phone and other platforms is starting to close, but there's still some high profile apps that don't exist here. I can do most of what I'm interested in, but this is going to be especially noticeable for smaller services/companies. Your local minor league baseball team may have iOS & Android apps, but they probably are not working on a Windows Phone version for example. Microsoft has recognized this and seems to be working hard to stir up interest (and also throwing money at developers to port), but still an issue, especially for people jumping platforms.The Bad:With Windows Phone 8, Microsoft got rid of the Zune software to sync with your PC in favor of exposing the folders to your PC via drag and drop. When you connect the phone to your PC, there's folders for Music, Documents, Videos, Ringtones, etc than you can drop files into to transfer them to your phone. This is actually a good thing if you're a person who wants to drag and drop files to/from your phone, but that is not in any way how I want to interact with a device.They released a Windows 8 app and a desktop app for Windows 7/8 to ""sync"" content to your phone from your Windows libraries or in the case of the desktop software, from iTunes. Unfortunately, these apps are very bare bones, and the desktop app crashes for me almost every time I try and sync music from iTunes. Microsoft provided no migration path for existing users using the Zune software to start syncing with Windows Phone 8, and strangely, for the ""best"" experience in terms of syncing your phone, it appears you should be using iTunes. And when the desktop app does actually work, it's not an actual ""sync"" at all, in terms of syncing up things like podcast positions, etc. between the phone and the PC, it's just a straight copy. In a lot of cases, album art isn't being copied down to the phone either.The entire Windows Phone 8 sync process has been a huge source of pain for people on various forums, with people ending up finding terrible workarounds to this setup. There's currently just no way to fill the gap left behind by moving away from the Zune software. I've got a fancy new phone with tons of space, and no easy way to fill it up with my content, drag and drop just really is not how I want to manage music in 2012.Getting rid of the Zune software also means no more sync over wifi, which was really one of the better Zune features.The Xbox Music Pass, and in particular the ""cloud"" features seem somewhat buggy as well, with things randomly working/not working. Same goes for purchases in the video store, although I'm not sure if those are supposed to work on Windows Phone 8 or not.Overall:Hardware wise, the 920 is fantastic, I have zero complaints, it's a huge step up from the last generation of Windows Phones.Unfortunately, software wise it really seems like we're in a similar situation to the 7.0 release, where things look promising, but most of the really interesting stuff isn't there. For Windows Phone 7, it was because they started from scratch. In Windows Phone 8, it seems to be due to the time required to get everything up and running on the new kernel. I'm hoping the new kernel and technology stack allow for more frequent OS updates, and there's a ""Mango"" style update in the hopper already.Hopefully the sync software gets better, and Microsoft can fill in the gaps to match an experience similar to the one the Zune software provided, because this really isn't enjoyable at all, and the features aimed at having everything content wise in the cloud are buggy at best, and broken at worst.UPDATE 3/6/2013:I've had the phone for about 4 months now, and honestly, not much has changed.Sync apps have gotten more stable, but none of the feature gaps between WP7/Zune and WP8 have been addressed at all. People I've talked to privately at Microsoft have expressed unhappiness with the current music/video/podcast experience on WP8, but so far we really haven't seen any major effort to fix it. Xbox video is STILL incompatible with WP8. Xbox Music is still a mess.WP8 is getting more apps, although honestly I attribute that more to Nokia than anything that Microsoft has done. We still are missing a number of high profile apps from other platforms, and many others lag behind other platforms in terms of features, etc. I also haven't seen much in the way of apps utilizing any features specific to WP8, such as the wallet, etc.The speed of updates for WP8 hasn't really changed much from WP7. We got Portico, which fixed some bugs and added a few features, but Microsoft has been largely silent on any future plans. Hopefully we don't end up waiting until Holiday 2013 for the next big update. To their credit, Nokia has been responsive, and been fixing/updating their apps frequently. It seems like in general, they're a lot more excited about the platform than Microsoft is.","November 16, 2012",1
mobile phone,Nokia 920,rugby49,R3MCD0ZEND0UL2,3,"I did not buy from Amazon. Purchased from AT&T; corporate store about 5 days ago. I have not used a Windows phone since the PocketPC days and switched from an Iphone 5. Did not have a whole lot to transfer over except for contacts from Google which occurred flawlessly. I was able to hook up Bluetooth to my Acura without a problem. Calls are clear and plenty loud. The screen is exceptional and does work with gloves which is a tremendous plus when skiing. I like the live tiles, only some apps have this function. I had a problem for awhile transferring my DMR free music from Itunes on my MacBook pro until I checked the box in the Windows Phone Software for Mac, ""Allow Access to Folder"". The one issue I have is streaming over Bluetooth. The sound is terrible especially in the car and the volume is extremely low. I am 59 and do not play music so everyone within 20 feet can hear it, but I do want to hear it over the treadmill. I purchased the Jaybird Sportsband just before Christmas. Worked great with Iphone 5. With the Nokia the sound is muddied, kind of mono sounding, and volume is low with both the phone and headset cranked up. The phone has no sound controls for wireless headsets and does not support all features apparently that the headset might have. I found that if I turn the volume down using the Sportsband, the phone stays maxed at 30 and I cannot use the Sportsband to turn the volume back up. I have to delete the device from the Bluetooth app and then sync it again. When I get home on Friday I will try it with 3 other Wireless headsets I have, but I have a feeling that this is a Win 8 software limitation at the moment. For me this is a big limitation as I have been wireless for awhile now and play music solely over Bluetooth. I will try the Sportsband with another Win 8 phone at the store along with the display Nokia 920 to see if my phone has a problem or again if this is a Win 8 phone limitation. Other than the Bluetooth function the phone works great and the screen is very nice.","March 7, 2013",1

mobile phone,"Great phone, great value",tech boo,R13MTWRWR24WJ,3,"This is my first smart phone and first android device. I'm used to apple products. I have iPods and iPads. But for $700 did not want to buy the iPhone. For half that I can get the Nexus 4, and with better specs than the iPhone 4S.Love the screen size. The speed and reliability of this phone. Never an issue making calls on T Mobile. It did freeze on me once when I ran a new app. Had to hard reset and deleted the app. To me this phone beats the iPhone. I just can't use the iPhone 5's tiny screen. Going from an ipad mini to an iPhone is too much of a down size.The battery is just about average. Heavy use will probably not last the day. Medium use barely makes the full 16 hrs. So basically is charge at night use during the day, repeat.Android OS is nice, not as polished as iOS 6. The trade off is freedom from big brother apple, but some of the apps really suck. The same apps in android just don't look as good nor perform as well as the same apps in iOS.Stock android apps also aren't as full featured as apple apps. The clock is so basic I had to get another one. The calculator is almost useless beyond +- / *.So in summary. The phone itself is a 9. Now compared to newer ones down to an 8. But the price bumps it up to an 8.5. The most bang for the buck by a long shot. In fact there isn't any competition in this category. The biggest disappointment is the OS. Definitely a downgrade from iOS. But then I don't have to deal with iTunes, so it definitely wins there.Love this phone and so glad I bought it over iPhone and S3/S4.***** Update *****After daily use for awhile now I love this phone even more. And loving T Mobile too. Because T Mobile now is offering unlimited everything and no contracts, having a smart phone is affordable and a tech geeks dream.Briefly, since moving to T Mobile I don't have to worry about any overage charges, just the same bill month after month, no surprises. Because I get unlimited data even on the lowest tier plan (only 500 mb of high speed data, then it is throttled down to 2g speeds), I can use the Nexus 4 without a worry. Actually my only worry is if the battery will last the day. I love driving around town using GPS and Pandora at the same time. I was afraid that the 2g speeds would prevent me from doing this, but it streams music and runs Navigation seamlessly. It seems to all work as if I were on 4g speeds, I cannot tell the difference in performance.This brings me to my most pleasant surprise so far. Since I need to pump Pandora through the car speakers with an audio jack and I like to use Navigation at the same time, I was startled to hear the music being muted then the Nav voice tell me where to go through the car speakers! I had no idea that it could do this. I know pretty naive, but this is my first smart phone. Google Nav blows my Garmin away. I don't have to worry about outdated maps, slow start ups, input that takes forever and a dead battery. I hardly use the Garmin any more. Garmin had better watch out before it becomes the next Block Buster.2g speeds: although running Pandora and Nav doesn't seem to be any slower, web surfing sure is. It may take a minute to open a web page that took only 10 sec on 4g. So there definitely is a throttle, but for me I may only be throttled for the last week or so of each month. Definitely worth the savings for a minor temporary inconvenience.The Google Nexus 4 has made my life a lot easier and T mobile has made it all happen without much more cost than what we were paying for two dumb phones.****2014 update ****I'm reducing the star rating to 3.5. I have to reset the phone every week. Thing start to not work, most importantly it will not charge! What a strange thing to happen. The instructions even say to rest the phone once a week. That's just silly. Anyways the phone wasn't that expensive compared to the flagship phones of the big boys, so I can live with the annoying rest requirements. If this was a samsung galaxy or iPhone I'd be asking for my money back. I guess you can't have everything when paying 50% off premium.","April 27, 2013",1
mobile phone,"Good smartphone, bad battery",Alexis Sherman,R38AB6RVVH8LB7,3,"This smartphone itself has served me well for almost an year. It is quite fast, it has a nice screen and the materials of which it is made are of good quality. Unfortunately, the battery has started to loose is efficiency. I have to recharge it once a day.","June 4, 2014",1
mobile phone,chat with great elan,wings,RZR18XGGKW2X8,3,"sharp lines, sleek glass face, agile to leap from application to application, great phone except for the battery life. i have had the device for two days and at end of each day the juice meter registers 'low'. i suggest keeping the charger whenever you leave the house. the mechanical drawback is overtime the constant plugging of the charger's tine to the portal will make it loose and unserviceable. i suppose all rechargeable devices have this propensity for mechanical failure.","February 21, 2014",1
mobile phone,Washed out colors,t345,RQ6C16TA5Q7OK,3,"Overall the phone is pretty good. The screen itself is sharp and the clarity is great. The only problem I have is that the colors are extremely washed out. When I compare it to my old Samsung galaxy S2 screen, my samsung phone beats it hands down on color quality. The nexus 4 settings currently have no options to fix this. The only way to fix it is to root your phone (which immediately voids any warranty) and download some kernels or pay a few bucks for someones app that will work on a rooted phone. If you are considering buying this phone, I'd check it out at a store first against your current phones color scheme and see if you can live with it. I gave it 3 stars because I expected more from google in this area, and didn't think it would be an issue (Even my old samsung S2 comes with 3 presets to choose from). Otherwise, the phone works great and no complaints.","September 27, 2013",1
mobile phone,"Love the phone, fragile as hell",C. Mcrae,R1QVS10CYGV96V,3,"The phone is functionally excellent. It breaks easier than ice. I'm really giving a 3.5 Star review.You absolutely need a case for this phone. The glass is very fragile, and the digitizer breaks very easily. It's good for the price, but let's be smart here google/ LG... Don't make a glass phone.... That's what I hate about iphones, and now what I hate about the nexus. Parts are also expensive to repair, but easy to do with an online video.Samsung phones hold up a lot better, and are good for people who are slightly clumsy.","August 21, 2013",1
mobile phone,Not all it's cracked up to be...,"Poochie ""Stuck with Microsoft""",R30WSSI9GL4SBP,3,"Like any other product, the Nexus 4 has its good points and its not so good points. Since I am, by nature, a seeker of improvement opportunities, here are a few (after three weeks of using the phone, and upgrading to Android 4.3):- Having come from a smartphone with a 3.5 inch screen, I find the width a little unwieldy, but I am getting used to it.- I installed another keyboard from the native Android set. Instead of simply *adding* the globe key which changes keyboards, the system *replaced* the comma on the English keyboard with the globe. Not convenient.- The staying power of the battery is not as advertised. With nothing active on a regular basis (not Bluetooth, not WiFi, not Auto Sync, Data Transfer turned off, there is no radio...), the battery is half run down in 14 hours. And I use the telephone less than 30 minutes in a day. (So why did I spend so much money on a phone? - Ah, that's also a good question.)- A solution to this situation would be to carry a spare, fully-charged battery. But the battery in a Nexus 4 is not removable.- The Nexus 4 was recommended by folks at work who are highly knowledgeable about such things. One of the points they made is that, with no service provider involved, I would be getting native Android, without all the bells and whistles added by service providers. Not true. There is a whole bunch of Google stuff included which I will never use, and which I cannot remove.On the plus side:- The sync is almost instantaneous - and I have as much stuff to synchronize as I did on my previous phone, where it took five minutes or more (with 4GB of memory, as opposed to the 16GB I have here).- On my previous phone, the pull bar on the Contacts list went from A to Z and then ""other"". On the Nexus, the order is A to Z and then my second alphabet, letter by letter, from beginning to end. A really handy improvement.- I am not a major user of the camera. However, for those times I have used it, it has performed well and given me crystal-clear, well-defined pictures. (I haven't yet used the video feature.)Now I intend to read through the user manual (over 200 pages) and really learn about the phone. I hope to revise this review as I go along. 2013-08-16.","August 16, 2013",1
