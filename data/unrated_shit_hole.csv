cameras,Good; not great; flawed; expensive,"db ""db""",R136F5JUHX7TPI,3,"My son dropped my Canon SD1100is, a great camera that I loved, so I bought SD780is as a replacement, and was ultimately disappointed and returned the camera. Both cameras are a very convenient size and they use the same battery. Problems I encountered with the SD780is are (1) that the door/piece/cover that covers where the battery and SD card are inserted was loose. It shifted/wiggled/moved every time I took a picture, just a little bit but enough to be annoying and unacceptable in an almost-$300 point-and-shoot camera. It just felt cheap and wrong given the price that I paid and given that other cameras don't do this. At first I planned to exchange the camera, but then I found that the cover wiggled on the 2nd SD780is that I looked at too, so I got a refund. (2) Second, the HD video was a primary reason that I bought the SD780is instead of SD1200is, but when I viewed the HD video on my computers it consistently had a line/defect/artifact? through the video-not good. (3) Third, at one point the 780 camera screen didn't seem to turn on and function when I hit the power button, though later at the store it did turn on for the salesperson, so I'm not sure how to explain this unusual event. (4) Fourth, still picture lighting and flashing was inconsistent, producing some disappointing photos in normal-usage situations. (5) Lastly, shutter lag is a problem; there's often what feels like a half-second delay between the time that you push the button and when the picture is taken; this is a problem with a lot of point and shoots but is quite annoying even if lots of cameras have a similar flaw. Overall, this might be an okay camera but I would also consider alternatives, especially considering the price. I expected the newer, more expensive, SD780is to perform better than my older, cheaper SD1100is, but it did not deliver as I hoped and expected it would.","July 8, 2009",
cameras,Fine if you want a small camera,sa,R2NBRYPPZQAMW6,3,"I purchased this camera for my wife in April '09 so that it would be easier to keep in her purse when needed. It is indeed small and easy to carry around. This is our third Canon Powershot camera. I must say that the first one we owned took better indoor, zoomed pictures. This camera is awful when zoomed to the optical limit of 3x. (indoors) Outside the shots are fine. The HD video is impressive for a small camera. I just can't get over the BLURRRRRR every time a shot is taken indoors. Hmmmmm, I thought his had that new feature called Motion Detection Technology. If only I could get back my Canon 2MP camera. Oh well!","August 8, 2009",
cameras,Should've just rebought my old camera,popcornkid,RULPWDR83O9AO,3,"Had a Canon Powershot 1200IS. It broke. Got this one, thinking it'd be the same, just higher res. pictures. I was wrong. Seems like it's lacking image stabilizing which was in the 1200. Shots only come out clear if it's on auto. in the program mode, hands must be stiller than a surgeons and still might come out blurry. Very frustrating. Stick with the 1200. I regret this purchase.","August 23, 2010",
cameras,"Poor low light/Indoor, small size, but not for primary use",Muruks,RHVTCSHOLBAG0,3,"I purchased this camera from Amazon for my brother. I made this choice against several Panasonic and Sony point & shoot cameras after seeing the large number of positive user reviews this model received in Amazon. I currently own a Nikon DSLR(D40) with couple of additional lens. And hence I would be comparing this model with my DSLR for picture quality.I got the silver colour as the black did not seem impressive in the Amazon online product gallery (but i later saw a review from one of the user that black is indeed beautiful). After I opened the box and got the camera to the hand, the feeling was really great!, it felt very tiny and light weight, but I quickly became curious to know how is thing camera going to perform in picture quality - the main purpose we buy a camera for. I put in a 2 GB card quickly and started taking few pictures inside the room. The pictures came out grainy, even with flash - which was disappointing. The quality of pictures were not near the entry level DSLR or even bigger cousins (Powershot, 200$ and above models) from Canon. The reason could be smaller size of lens and sensor in this camera. The lack of manual mode or wide angle would not bother me as long as a camera can take really good photos at normal zoom (group of people, face, building etc) which is where we use P&S; cameras 90% of the time. For me good picture quality in all modes (outdoor/indoor/night) stands as the primary reason for choosing a camera. While this camera can be great as a light weight travel camera for casual photography - I would suggest to go with a slightly higher end (with bigger aperture lens) model from Canon or Panasonic (Canon SX120IS around 200$ or Canon S90), you dont need fancier ones) . Or else you would be disappointed when you see the results from other bigger ones.","April 20, 2010",
cameras,NOT THAT GREAT!,Wolfee1,R2OOU6LJ6JSWE7,3,"I bought this Camera because of it's size, and the wonderful Reviews, it is so small, it fits anywhere, my sister liked it so much I got one for her Birthday as well, hers is Deep Red, mine in Silver color, after we had the Cameras for a while and I am always taking pictures , we noticed that the shutter speed is too slow, I have to wait for the Camera to do it's thing before I take the next Picture and many times the object is gone, the automatic flash is not reliable enough, a lot of the pictures are too dark or out of focus, my sister doesn't want to use it anymore, and I feel the same way. We have this Camera for a year now, and looking for a better one preferably a Sony Cyber-Shot like I used to own, I thought it was the best, till I dropped it and broke! We are disappointed, this was our first Canon....yeah, you guessed it, next Camera will be a different Brand, that's for Sure!","May 23, 2011",
cameras,broke soon,farnaz,R226Z9WN9KA7JH,3,The lens broke after a few months. I had to spend $150 to repair the lens. I;m not that happy with the images. They are too bright although I have tried to change the settings to improve it. My husbands iphone takes much better pictures.,"October 26, 2010",
cameras,Seems a bit flimsy compared with my previous model,Tenderfoot,RTTUDGP2SFJUI,3,"The picture quality is quite good with this camera and viewable image is larger but the way its put together seems cheaper and control features are more recessed. Thus, though I don't have large fingers, operating the camera feels a bit clumsy. I'll keep it however.","February 7, 2010",
cameras,Extremely cute and usable pocket cam with very low IQ,Luving it,R90L1WHKGX460,3,"Comparing to my DSLRs - no comparison.Comparing to my Casio Exlime, same IQ, but better video.Pro:- Extremely cute, well build, look&feel;, better than all others I've tried, Nikon Coolpix, Casio Exlime, Sony.- Great usability for a pocket P'nS cam - very responsible shutter, ultra fast FA, IS seems to be effective.- Good video quality with AF.- Intuitive user interface. No need for manual really.Con:- Lousy picture quality. Very lousy indeed. This point alone defeats all the pros it has for my purpose. I just need something to be constantly in my pocket in case my DSLR is not available or connenient. I remember the older Digital Elph to be bigger and more expensive but with much better IQ indoor or outside. This new Elph is a lot cheaper but the IQ is just like any other cheap cam from any other brand - a huge disappointment for my purpose. Like another reviewer said - 12MB pixel is just a marketing hoax that makes the file unnecessarily big. The IQ really isn't much better than my Canon video cam shooting still at 3MB. Ok, maybe a little better :) But not by much.Bottom line - A great pocket cam with very disappointing IQ. For my purpose, it's useless, which really is unfortunate. Because otherwise I really love this little cam.","March 14, 2010",
cameras,Cannon Powershot SD780IS,"E. T. Martin ""ebbmart""",R3J1GOD62WKR02,3,"Great camera for what it is... small, inexpensive and stylish. I carry it when going out at night with friends, and anytime I even think I might want a picture... It is so small that I forget it is there! Night shots, image stability are not the best, but Im still learning how to use it to get the best pics in those conditions.For the $200 it is a really small, fast, well built camera. I was particularly excited about the rounded corners... after having a SD1200 (ex took it), my thigh was bruised from the sharp corners.","October 24, 2009",
cameras,Compact but cheap,eric duncan,R2J9P0A4TEYX4P,3,"Yes this camera is very small and it fits in your pocket no problem. This enables you to get shots you might not have otherwise because you actually have a camera with you. That is the best feature.The price you pay? Cheap construction- my lens randomly stopped retracting/working 3 months in. Canon is repairing for free for the record. Picture quality is a bit worse than other point and shoots (like my friend's panasonic lumix) on ""auto"" which is where most people shoot these types of cameras anyway. Overall yes its small but its also kind of a little POS.","August 23, 2010",
cameras,Not for pockets - unusable after less than a year,Gregory Bloom,R3B83E83PK8GQE,3,"I have owned the SD780IS for almost a year, and have taken several thousand pictures with it. Overall, this is a great camera, but....Being a point-n-shoot, I always carry it around in my jeans pocket. Unfortunately, dust has gradually crept into the optics. At first it was barely noticeable - in fact it was only after it became unmistakable that I reviewed earlier photos and saw dust blobs there too. For un-zoomed pictures, this dust results in a slight haze. But for zoomed-in pictures, there are mysterious dark blobs all over the photo. I spoke with the local camera repair shop about getting the optics cleaned, and they explained that the optics assembly is a single part and that Canon will not supply them with the necessary calibration software. The only option was a one-size-fixes-all price of $119, plus shipping both ways. Since I can get a whole new SD780IS for $145 with free shipping, having the camera repaired at that price makes no sense at all. Plus, it would still be prone to dust gunking up the internal optics.So instead of repairing or replacing it with a new SD780IS, I'm going with a waterproof point-n-shoot (Panasonic Lumix DMC-TS2). Much more expensive, but hopefully I'll have a camera that lasts longer than 12 months.","August 12, 2010",
cameras,a bit disapointed with image quality,D. Miranda,R37T2A4WTNME9G,3,"This camera is easy to use and very compact, but I was a bit disappointed with image quality. Image was grainy (noisy) and slightly out of focus at the edges even in broad daylight. Low light performance is even worse.The big plus is it's HD movie mode, with good quality image and sound. Image is still a biy grainy (noisy).","March 21, 2010",
cameras,Noisy in low light; controls could be bigger,Douglas Richardson,R20IT7ZSUCKEPY,3,The video is pretty noisy in normal indoor lighting. Outside in daylight it looks great. Photos don't suffer from noise as much as video since you can use a flash.The controls on the back are small and not raised enough for me to operate accurately without using my fingernails.The model I got has a dead pixel in the sensor. This shows up as a very small white speck on photos (which is really not noticeable) but on videos it becomes a very noticeable red dot. I'm sure Canon will fix it but it's a pain to send to them and I have to pay shipping.,"December 29, 2009",
cameras,Disappointing Image Quality,"Nightowl ""Carina""",R2DJT6WEWTBD81,3,"Based on all the great customer reviews, I was excited when this camera arrived. It is extremely small but has a nice overall feel of quality and looks pretty cool. One gripe I have with the built is that the camera/memory card door is a bit flimsy and seems to be made of cheap plastic in stark contrast to the rest of the body. It wobbles slightly which may be minor for some, but it was enough to bother me.I have small hands but this camera seems almost a bit too small at the expense of usability. The position of the flash is annoying and if you don't remember to keep your fingers well out of its range you'll cast dark shadows onto the picture. Some buttons are so tiny that you need to use your finger nail to push them.But what ultimately made me return this camera is the soft focus, even in bright sunlight. Since the zoom is very modest I thought that the large number of megapixels would allow me to crop liberally. Unfortunately, this is not possible due to the soft focus and frequent purple fringing. I prefer sharp crisp images but was not able to find a setting which would please me.The video is great if you don't point at a light source, but that feature alone was not enough to make up for the disappointing image quality.","August 26, 2009",
cameras,Too SMall,BTShopper,R2MWJIZ3ABHLED,3,"This camera was too small for my husband to use. The view finder was too small and his fingers were too large to work the controls on the back. I returned the camera. I've heard it takes great pictures, we just need a larger one.","March 29, 2010",
cameras,"Decent, but a bit disappointed",Target Luver,R32VUYBSW6R350,3,"Couple bummers for me: couldn't connect to download pictures to computer w/ USB -- I even downloaded the software and it still didn't work. I got a card reader, so I'm able to now, but that was a tad annoying to work around. Also the viewfinder picture is a bit yellow and grainy -- but the photo ends up coming out fine. The ""shutter lag"" is also a little frustrating, esp. when asking strangers to take you and your friends' pictures! I guess you can press button 1/2-way down and that preps it to take the pic quickly after that, but that's obviously too much to explain to anyone who you're asking to take a picture. Anyway, I've always loved Canon, so I'm sticking with it.","December 5, 2009",
cameras,Not even close to the old SD500,"Michael Rosas ""mrosas""",RD7MVSKBOXKF5,3,"I bought this camera for my wife to document our new born baby.The main thing I noticed was that the picture quality was not up to par with my old SD500 camera. Really dissapointed.On a positive note, the video quality is really good and in HD.Cool size, but I actually thought the bigger. It's almost too small, I would have bought a bigger camera if I new the correct size.","March 12, 2010",
cameras,Movie Feature,grummix,R1IXRS7YRXZ2EM,3,"Bought this camera mainly cause I thought with its OIS it would be more stable than my Vado hand-held.Turns out the Canon video shows plenty of noise, which makes me want to put it aside.Worse, for a PC Windows user, I have yet find a satisfactory way to edit this Quicktime movie format. Even bought Apple's Quicktime Pro, but this software is a bear of an application when it comes to make a movie out of several clips.Any ideas are welcome.Update: Used the ZoomBrowser software Canon provides with this camera to stich several video clips together into a large movie.Was astonished to realize the software transformed the Quicktime mov file into an ""avi"" file, one that can now be played with the Windows Media Player-very good video results too, a big surprise.Amazing Grace, Canon why are you not recording the videos in the ""avi"" format in the first place.Perhaps this newly converted file can now be edited with an ordinary Windows based editing software?","April 19, 2009",

cameras,No sound recorder!,Asher,R1YQ8N195ZI2NH,3,"The camera is designed very well. It feels very durable, and is small, with a quick start up speed. The photos and HD video look great so far. Here's my only problem. Canon has removed one of the nicest features of its previous SD cameras: the sound recorder. With the lens retracted, you used to be able to record up to an hour of high quality audio. I'm very disappointed that they've removed this feature! Canon has also removed the fun ""stop action video mode"". Perhaps they thought they were removing clutter from the menus, but they also removed some great features!","April 16, 2009",
cameras,Cool looking camera......Bad video quality,ArkRaider,R2WNA23FOYJ5SN,3,"I bought this camera from best buy on sale. I did a few days of research and was leaning toward the sony t500. Then I saw this canon on sale so I picked it up. I am now returning it because the video quality is really quite terrible. There is noise all over it! Even on a bright sunny day outside, you could still see noticeable noise in the video. Also, beware the HD video. I had seen online where some people warned that it takes a lot of cpu to edit it. Well my pc couldn't even play back the video file without it being choppy. And I have a very nice pc! Just keep that in mind. I do have to say the camera itself looks very cool and the menu system is very intuitive. But looks can be deceiving.=)","March 26, 2009",
cameras,As compared to the SD110,Sidney G. Mcdaniel,R29MO4D9ER3V0A,3,"I bought the SD110 (3.2MP) back in 2004 and decided it was time to upgrade this year as it was showing some age. The latest version of that same line is the SD1200. I have had it for a few weeks now and have a few observations. The SD1200 is much faster from the time you turn it on until it is ready to shoot as compared to the SD110. Next, the screen is far better than the one on the SD110. Very bright and readable even in sunlight. The camera itself is smaller than the SD110 as you might expect but does feel a little cheaper. So far I have taken the SD1200 to three main events. A birthday party, K-4 graduation, backyard play time. The birthday part pictures did not turn out well in automatic mode. We were indoors (Pump-it-up) and the lighting was probably not the best. The images were blurry for the most part. I had the same issue at the second event (K-4 graduation) but this time I switched to manual mode and used the ""indoor"" setting. This greatly improved the picture. Finally, the outdoor shots turned out looking wonderful in automatic mode. With the SD110 the automatic mode was always better than any of the manual settings. It seems with the SD1200 that is not the case. I will continue to explore the settings/features of the camera. I was expecting the SD1200 to be far superior to my 5 year old SD110 but so far the pictures themselves have not turned out markedly better.","May 17, 2009",

Lens error message seen on screen and calling Canon resulted only in send it for repairs. Read on internet several threads about Canon small cameras having dreaded lens error causing camera to be inoperatable. Many report that Canon did not honor warranty saying camera dropped or mistreated. I just sent my in. Don't know what Canon will say but not hopeful. Like picture quality with few pictures I got from camera before it died.UPDATE 6-18-2009 Camera returned from Canon with complete lens assembly replacment. I appreciated that it was covered under warranty! Thanks Canon. Just want readers to be aware if they search internet for Canon lens error that this is a problem reported by many who own the smaller Canon cameras like sd1100 and sd1200,"June 7, 2009",
cameras,Didn't give me the big WOW factor I wanted or expected.,Jennifer,R2OPPSAS5GBSUT,3,"After four years of using the heck out of (and LOVING) my SD600, the two batteries no longer hold charges well, so it was either $80 for two new Canon batteries (I know I can get off brands but I don't think they last as long), I decided to spend the bucks on the new Canon SD1200.I only tested it for one day because when I pulled it out of the box, the LCD screen had a HUGE scratch on it, so I knew I would be returning it. But I took a bunch of test shots to see if I really liked it and wanted to re-purchase it. Keeping in mind I didn't get to review every aspect of the camera, what was my overall review after one day's worth of test shots? In one word: meh.There were highs and lows/pros and cons. I am sure I would grow to love it, but there are definitely things I like and things I don't.CONS?* The power button is harder to turn on (moreso one-handed like I normally do since I am rushing to take a quick picture of the baby). It doesn't stick out as much as on the SD600. (On the 600 I could quick push the raised button with my fingernail. On the 1200 the button is more flat so it's harder to reach.) Other reviews have liked this, as they don't want to accidentally turn their camera on...but in the four years I've used this camera, I've never had it turn on accidentally in any pocket, purse, bag, etc...so I don't like the new button style. I am sure, with time, I would get used to it...but my first impression wasn't favorable.* The slider bar (between auto, program, and video) is not as easy to slide as the 600--and it's a bit harder to do one-handed as well (which is how I normally use it, especially when taking pics of the baby). Again, I think the button was raised more on the 600 than on the 1200. I can slide the bar on the 600 by feeling the clicks as it moves from one status to the next--and can easily flick back and forth with ease. With the 1200, I had to pay special attention to moving it and I often overshot the status I wanted. Again, I am sure with time I would get used to it...but my first impression wasn't favorable.* The Auto function didn't seem to work as well as I thought it would--I got A LOT of blurry and too-dark and too-bright pictures that I really thought would be normalized with such a lauded AUTO feature. And I was sure I did things right (hold the button down halfway first, etc.). I really wanted to love the new features of Auto because I currently use Program all the time to adjust the amount of flash (so I can take closeups of the boy without blinding him or to add more flash when it's dark in the room) and Auto should take care of that. It may have just needed more experimentation? But then again, it shouldn't have--because it's AUTO.* The wrist strap isn't adjustable. It's not something I use a lot, but when I want it, I like having it there (like on a carnival ride or hanging over the balcony of a cruise ship). It's just a little thing, but it could be a very big thing if it's something that causes you to lose your camera. (If I bought this camera again, I would switch straps with my current camera, the 600.)PROS?* The ability to use a 16GB HDSC card! Pure heaven...especially since I take close to 1000 pictures a month of the kidlet! The 600 can handle a 2GB card which fits a lot of photos, and I rarely am away from home for so long that I can't offload the pictures...but I love having space and 16GB is enough to take tons of pictures and long videos without having to edit/delete photos while you go.* I do like the specific play button (instead of it being on the slider bar).* This camera takes the easiest and best macro photos of any I've ever owned. Pure awesome. (But how often do I need that? Not very.)* Some Auto flash shots turned out way better than I expected. Our living room is about 18' long and often dark. I just took a quick test shot from the kitchen and it lit up the entire room like daylight!* Most of the menu options are the same as my 600 so the learning curve wouldn't be too high.* I love that it's available in colors. Silver tends to get lost in the shuffle of mess on the counters or in a bag. But colors really stand out so it's easier to find quickly.So, will I be buying this camera again? I'm honestly still deciding, but am leaning towards probably not. I was really excited to get a new/better/faster camera...but it just didn't give me the big WOW factor I wanted and was expecting. And as you know with cameras, the next thing is just around the corner...","September 17, 2009",
cameras,"Over priced, low quality images",Sam Hod,R3RC6EANKUG85,3,"When taking pictures in bright light the quality is fine. However, when taking in low light (see an typical lamp lit room at night to anything darker) the quality of the image degrades significantly. There is a VERY noticeable grainy and blurry quality to the picture. This camera is NOT capable of taking low light pictures in automatic mode. Switching to to manual and messing with the setting will improve the picture. However, there will still be a bit of a blur and grain. The only good quality of this camera is it compact design and very fast off to picture taking capable time.Overall, I am unhappy with this camera and would NOT buy it again, nor recommend it to anyone. The inability to take a decent picture at night when it seems like there is plenty of light around is a killer. The camera is well made. It seems sturdy and like it can handle being in the pocket despite its small size. This will fit into the tiny pocket of a female's jeans without worries of it falling out.","October 24, 2009",
cameras,slightly disappointed,"L. Doong ""ugarugger""",RPOHTB5WLZ70S,3,"I've owned a few Canon powershot cameras over the years, and in general I have been very happy with them (obviously if I keep buying them). But this particular model has a few flaws that have really disappointed me since I purchased the camera in Oct. 2009.1. the auto focus hasn't been working properly - especially in indoor situations. Many times when trying to take photos of friends, I've noticed that the auto focus changes to the macro setting. And no, I'm not taking close-ups. So in order to take decent photos I have to set it to manual and indoor, then the photos turn out nicely.1. the image stabilization doesn't work too well - I have to hold the camera extra still for the picture to come out clearly. any movement whatsoever and the photo comes out blurry.To be fair, I don't know if this is just a problem with my particular unit (i.e. I got a lemon) or if this is a problem with the overall model - I haven't bothered looking at all the other reviews, as I don't have that kind of time.I am going to contact Canon directly and see what they can/will do about it - I will update this review afterwards...I really hope it's just a problem with my unit because I have been very happy with Canon cameras and would hate for this one model to ruin that for me.","February 10, 2010",
cameras,very UNDER impressed,"J. Finan ""Jack of All Trades""",R1A8UCES0CZ97D,3,"Just got this cam yesterday and I had high hopes. Unfortunately, I think that I may end up returning this camera.PROS:*yes, it is very small and attractive*seems well constructed*good price ($150) for supposed ""CANON QUALITY""*charger is compact and nicely designedCONS:*terrible low light performance! my pictures are either too dim (if the subject is more than 6' away), too grainy/noisy, or straight up blurry because the shutter is so slow (to let in enough light) that the subjects are blurry from slight movements*weak flash (contributes to above point)*colors seem bad, off, and/or weak...maybe a fault w/ auto WB, I will experiment w/ manual selection of WB*menus are a bit convoluted; you can't get to certain settings unless you are in certain modes. you change the mode, and all the sudden the same menu button opens a ton more settings that weren't there before. I realize it is because these settings probably only apply to the current mode, but how about some ""master"" settings, so u can have the same preferences already set fro when you go into the associated modes???*waterproof case. this is a general canon complaint. they make probably 10 current compact models that can use a waterproof case. unfortunately, they use 10 different cases. each costs ~$200...that means if I want to buy a case for more than I paid for the camera, it is worthless in 2-3 years when the camera breaks and I cant find (or wouldn't want) a replacement. hey Canon, how about a little more interchangeability. couldn't you use a fairly standard shell and just upgrade the internals? maybe make the case so if one camera had a longer lens, or was bit thicker, you could just change some little rubber spacers in the waterproof case? as it is right now, I want a waterproof case, but I can't buy it now because I don't know if I'm going to keep this camera. so make more universal cases or make better cameras so I don't need to second guess keeping it. :)If anyone has any suggestions to improve the quality of this camera (besides plunking down another $200 for a better model, I would greatly appreciate it. I have had compact Sony's (Cyber Shot DSC-W7), Nikon's (2100 Coolpix), Kodak?, and various older digital cameras...and I would rate this Canon as the most compact, but probably in the lower quartile in terms of image quality (down with the cheaper/older cameras).

Sometimes the auto doesn't focus correctly and I have to turn it off and on again for it to work and by then the photo opportunity goes away! Right now, my iPhone photos are better.","October 21, 2013",

cameras,Poor latch on battery/SD Card Compartment,Dave Davis,R3EEPNFU5LGHKE,3,"I've owned Canons since the 70's. I started out with an AE-1 and now have an XSi. I'm very partial to Canon cameras and thought this one would be a good one to carry around in my pocket so I ordered one from Amazon. I was really surprised when I received the camera and opened the battery compartment. The battery compartment door and latch is plastic and very flimsy, didn't close with a tight ""snap"", and didn't seem strong enough. I could just visualize the door breaking as I am constantly inserting and removing SD cards in my cameras. I returned it without even snapping any photos so I really can't comment on photo quality. Knowing Canon, the quality is probably great but my concern over the latch was a major issue with me.","January 19, 2010",

""Somewhere, Racin' or Playin' Music""",R26C784PNVEV8K,3,"I bought this camera as a replacement to my previous 570IS, though I had a Nikon for a few days, but thats another story.This particular camera works just fine for your average run of the mill taking of pictures, It only has 3x optical zoom, so you can't get those close ups unless you're close up. it has a tough time with low light pictures at times, but its only a pocket rocket.Video, I use it too much, it has an audio limit, so no rock concerts unless you want all the breaking up and distortion of sound. I wish it had an image stabilization in the video like the Nikons, but it works fine.All in all, its ok, if you can get a killer deal like me.","October 25, 2010",

Every picture is hit or miss, with about half coming out very blurry. For instance, if you are with a group of friends and let someone else take a picture of your group, odds are it's going to come out blurry. Luckily I've had some folks say ""let me take one more"" when they realized it was blurry, then they got another good photo.I honestly don't understand where all the good reviews are coming from with this camera. It's like ten steps back compared to all of the other Canon cameras I've owned. Think I'm going to try another brand.","January 22, 2011",
cameras,"Poor picture quality, broke within one year, poor customer service (Canon)",Foodie78,RSFGUOOF5B4CA,3,"I received this camera as a gift and immediately was disappointed in the quality of the photos. Outdoor shots look great, but indoor shots always come out grey-ish and require photoshopping. The flash is too bright, and even after it is adjusted, the focal point is blown out. The one feature I love is the video. The videos come out much clearer than those from our mid-range digital video camera. My biggest beef is that the toggle that switches between video and regular photos stopped working, so now I am stuck in video mode. I contacted Canon and was told the repair would be $100 (I'm 15 days out of the year warranty), just $9 less than the new SD 1300 I just purchased last week as a gift. I was sent to the Canon ""loyalty"" department and told I could trade mine in for a refurbished model if I paid an additional $80. Very disappointing. Eventually, I spoke with someone who thinks they can help me get the camera fixed for free since the repair is minor and the warranty recently expired. I just hate having to go through the runaround and had hoped from more from Canon.","December 20, 2010",
cameras,nice point and shoot,"Sonador ""Megusta""",R1TUSZ5HFTL4X8,3,"What I like:+ auto settings for dif scenes (foliage, seaside, snow, etc.)+ I have gotten some great 'micro' closeup shots (insects, acorns)+ good image stabilization (anti-shake); I've taken some successful shots with slow shutter speed.+ great self-timerWhat I don't like:- badly designed operator's manual--who writes these things nowadays?! It is not intuitively accessible or even logical in some instances. Good luck with it.- And I really don't like this: no way to adjust the aperture, which I know isn't an issue for most people just wanting a point and shoot, but consider this: if you have a scene you really like, the depth of field (detail in the distance) won't be so great. (It shoots pretty consistently at the low end, 2.8). If you just look at 4 x 6's, you won't notice it, but if you want to make some quality enlargements, you will.- I got this model because it has a viewfinder, in addition to the lcd screen. But what you see in the viewfinder is not what will shoot, so it's an essentially worthless feature--which they have dropped on later versions.- I don't think it does so well with backlit subjects, or any uneven lighting scenes.I recommend getting a gorillapod tripod to use with this (I got the small one, and used it a lot in the woods with Fall scenes, myself hidden like Waldo in the scenes)","November 2, 2010",
cameras,Canon Power Shot,Luisa Maldonado-Stiers,R2EM6GZF3MBL9E,3,"Thi is a great little camera. It is compact, easy to use and takes great pictures. The fact that it brings its own battery charger is a plus as well. It takes great zoomed in pictures with little if no camera noise. The viewfinder is of great help when taking pictures in bright sunlight and the main reason why I purchased this camera, for its viewfinder. The video portion of this powershot is great if you do not have to zoom in and record. When doing so, the resulting video clip is blurry and grainy. This is a great disappointment and the reason why I gave it an overall 3-star. I have another small digital point and shoot camera, the Kodak Easy Share C182 and both its pictures and videos are of excellent quality. Unfortunately, it doesn't have a viewfinder so taking pictures in bright sunlight is difficult to accomplish.","October 31, 2010",
cameras,"Shooting video: Initial focus and that's all, per video",Thomas Hundt,R30NP3UMCA05FG,3,"One gotcha with this camera is that, when shooting a video, it focuses on whatever you're pointing at initially (when you push the shutter button halfway down), and then that's it for that video: It's impossible to get it to re-focus on something else. Zooming also screws it up. So forget about getting too creative with your videos with this thing. Forget about someone walking towards you, or zooming in, or showing a whole lot of action. (Because who wants action in a video, right?) Canon obviously wants to sell you a camcorder. :-(","September 14, 2010",
cameras,Bad Experience,Steve Samuelian,RH1QQLK7SI16E,3,"I bought the SD1200 to replace my trusty little SD800, which worked reliably for 2-3 years before I accidentally left it on top of my car at a gas station (no doubt making the finder very happy). I opted to buy a less expensive replacement, the SD1200. It wasn't love at first sight. The camera worked well enough, but it lacked manual controls, the picture quality wasn't great, and, frankly, I never truly warmed to it. After about six months of moderate use, I turned it on for the fifth time in a single day to discover that the lens wouldn't operate properly -- the fatal ""Lens Error, Restart Camera"" message was displayed on the bottom of the screen. Judging from the number of websites/chats devoted to this problem, it seems to be fairly common -- not just with Canon cameras but with all compact point and shoot cameras (although it certainly never happened with the SD800). I did some Web research and found that Canon Service/Repair isn't really an option because of cost. So I tried the various remedies posted by a number of others with the same/similar problem, pretty much in order of damage risk (battery in-out, tapping, banging, etc. etc.). My last action (more of curiosity than anything else) was to take the cover/shell off the camera in hopes of dislodging the lens, which i imagined was stuck, but this, too, failed -- although it was interesting to see what one of these marvels looks like on the inside....I haven't given up on Canon (I still am the happy owner of a Rebel XSi), but I'm now thinking of buying a more upscale compact (like the S90 or S95), which should give me the performance (and then some) that I miss from the now-outdated SD800. Of course, if I have another lens issue I might start to reconsider the whole brand-loyalty thing....","September 13, 2010",

When turned on in the ""auto"" program, the lens constantly made noise and the lens would try and focus repeatedly until the shutter button was held down and ultimately take the photo. This did not occur in any other mode.I returned the camera as I was unsure if it was defective or my dissatisfaction.Additionally, as other reviewers noted the viewfinder is too small and useless.","September 5, 2010",
cameras,My last Canon Powershot but still the best there is,Buff Crone,R27MCLYCN4IY39,3,"I've had four Canon Powershots. I bought my first one in 1999 and Canon has been my only brand of digital camera. I love the size and until this one, the interface.I have a new iPhone 4 and I'm sorry to say that the pictures I get from my iPhone are often as good and sometimes better than from this camera. I did a ton of research before buying it and I still think this is the best option. I like the fact that it is the last one with an actual viewfinder (which I use for certain technically difficult shots.)But I'm surprised at how difficult it still is to change the ISO or make manual adjustments. It shouldn't be this hard! I do like the automatic image setting selection (it knows if you are taking a portrait or a landscape) but with the iPhone, the only reason to buy a separate camera is to adjust manually for lighting, image speed, etc. and this one just isn't where I would like it to be. By the time I make the adjustment, I've missed the picture. I could show you side by side shots of a gorgeous sunset taken within seconds of one another with the iPhone and the Canon and there is no doubt that the color and focus on the iPhone shot is better.HOWEVER, if you want a digital camera to carry in your pocket, and last forever, this is the one to buy.

cameras,Why did they have to change the darned battery?,Chris,R1NWOCOVJYPLCD,3,"I've had two SD1000s, an SD1100, and now this one. I liked the first two a lot, mostly for shooting outdoor nature shots in very bright light, but really liked the IS on the 1100 for shooting in dark canyons, etc. I find many more of my pix are good (not blurry at least).But these cameras have problems with the lens gears - just google ""canon lens error"". I've had this on all my cameras (have not taken the 1200 in the field yet). I use them outdoors in places with very fine sand, but I keep them clean and in bags, never drop them. Now the 1100 fell onto a rock from 6 feet so I take blame for that, but I'm really disappointed in the lack of robustness - in fact part of the reason I have so many is that I won't go out into the field without a spare. Note that if they die within the first year, Canon graciously repairs them under warranty, as long as they don't look too beat up. And you often can get some more life out of them once the error starts by pushing the lens back so it is level - but the gears are plastic, they are wearing out all the while, you can hear grating noises.Nonetheless, I thought I have so many batteries and chargers why not stay with the family and I got the 1200. Sigh I was so disappointed that it has a different sized battery.So I've just jumped over to the Lumix ZR-1 as my most recent camera. Canon lost me when they did that battery change trick, and I'm hoping that the Lumix will turn out to be more robust in the field.","December 14, 2009",

cameras,Great Point & Shoot with Issues,L. Monte,R3B8QN9595LLZ9,3,"I bought this when my Sony Cybershot died. After weeks of researching, I decided on this camera. It seemed you can't beat it for the price. I'm an amateur photographer and my main camera is a Canon Rebel Xti DSLR. I wanted a camera to put in my pocket when I don't feel like lugging around my DSLR. Here's the good and the bad of this camera, I've had for a few months now...Pros:-Great, amazing, crisp Macro shots! This camera rivals my DSLR for Macro quality, beads of water on plants, flowers, food, etc. anything close up and this camera shines.-Outdoors this camera takes great landscape photos. Even at night, given you use a tripod this camera has great infinity detail.-Compact and slim enough to fit in jeans pocket.-Battery life, as with all Canons, is amazing. I'll use it for almost a week straight without needing a charge.-LCD is great, very vibrant, too vibrant I think, pics aren't as contrasted as it makes them look, but great nonetheless.Cons:-Flash is really harsh! So bad to where it's almost unusable indoors at night. My last camera had an option to adjust the flast either + or - one setting to adjust it's strenghth and I almost always left in on the minus (-) setting. If this camera had that, I'd give it 4 stars. It's so harsh that I'm considering a Gary Fong diffuser for it and permanently attaching it to it. It just blows out subjects, especially in Macro, forget about it.-Zoom is glitchy. The zoom constantly isn't smooth. It'll catch as I zoom in or out periodically and stall as I hold down the zoom switch.-It's very slippery. This camera has a very smooth finish and makes it easy to slip out of your hands. There's nothing to grip ontom it's all one smooth surface.Conclusion: This is a great camera for outdoors and macro shots, but indoors suffers, as most point and shoot cameras do, with a harsh flash. I'd look for a camera with an adjustable flash level because all digital camera's flashes by default are too bright and harsh for indoors. For $150 though, you can't ask for too much from this little camera...","May 22, 2010",

cameras,Poor Build Quality,Tony,R2XLX4ZUQAWW20,3,"I recently purchased this camera to replace my Panasonic FX150 on a 1 month trip to Europe.The quality of the photos from that camera never compared to my canon SD1100 that I had given to a family member in Ireland last summer.I have had numerous Canon cameras in the past (SD110, 10D, 20D, Pro1 and the SD1100) and was rarley disapointed.So I purchased the SD1200 a few weeks before my trip and tested it at a tall ships event in Boston.As always the quality was perfect for holiday snaps right out of the camera.So I traveled to Ireland with the SD1200 and brought the Panasonic just in case we had an issue.We were traveling to Ireland, Venice, Munich and Salzburg so I wanted to make sure I had a back up camera.The first day in Ireland we went to Spanish Point. It was a very windy day and as I was taking photos the camera shut down.I attempted to turn it back on, but kept getting a lens alignment error.After 83 photos the camera was dead because a strong wind knocked the lens out of alignment.I contacted cannon and they were of no help at all. All I could get were the standard canned responses from support.No one actually addressed my dissatisfaction or offered a solution. (Canon is in Europe also)So I went on my trip with the Panasonic FX150. Got my pictures back today and as my wife noted they are not very good. The FX150 randomly takes a nice photo, but most of the time they are overexposed or out of focus. Yes you can blame the photographer, but no matter what you do with the FX150 it has a mind of its own and you don't buy a point and shoot camera to be messing around with manual settings on vacation photos.The bottom line is I would not recommend this camera due to its build quality. Get the SD1100 (I think they were built in Japan - at least the early models) but avoid the camera in my opinion. And if you do buy it keep your old one as a backup, bad pictures are better than no pictures.","August 25, 2009",

Better video clarity than my powershot video feature, but no major improvements due to average image stabilizer which results on shaky recordings. However, I would think that shaky videos are expected on any/all small pocket camcorders these days. Definitely NOT recommended for low lighting, image quality is bad indoor low-light, my SD750 does far better job.If you have PS3, you have to convert .MOV file to .MP4 format using Quicktime Pro. Playbacks were decent on my PS3. Also, .MOV file plays on Windows7 in media player by default, which is nice.PROS:- Fits in your pocket very well. I purchased blackberry holster from target for $10 and it fits like a glove.- Average video quality for quick pocket cam, just have to be very steady when shooting.- Battery life isn't that bad, so far.- 2.5"" screen is ideal for small pocket cam IMO.- SD card slot.- HDMI feature is nice touch, it plays okay on my computer/tv monitor with HDMI port.- USB cable is flexible, so it sort a works with laptops and desktop front port.CONS:- Image stabilizer does not work well, need to keep it very steady (however, does not ruin the experience, still good videos).- Toggle button on front is less to be desired. I have small hand, but it's still difficult to left/right/up/down. I prefer individual buttons instead.- Buttons on front face is not as responsive as it should be, you don't feel like getting a confirmation feel when pushed, it has very hard feel, and could have made it tiny bit bigger.- No instructions or manual to improve your video experience. Though simple, you have to figure it all out on your own.- For the price, it should have included a least felt sleeve for protection.- 1080P is useless under low light.Overall, I would probably recommend this to my friends, but with caution over shakyness and bad low light recording capabilities. I think it's idea for people who has entry DSLR and want video feature as an option in pocket. I think it's ideal if you have the need for quick cam instances, like capturing kids.

cameras,"""Defective"" unit - but still good",M. Valenzuela,R29EAWJX3L96EA,3,"Alright, I purchased this from Kodak directly and got a great deal on the price. It has many great features. Rated the camera as I received it, still hear about people who have the defect and some who don't, so not sure if it is a design flaw or really a defect. More on the defect at the end.Features:Can take SD cards. Currently using a 16GB card that runs great, even with 1080 recording.Easy to use. Both a plus and minus. I like how easy it is to operate, but I would like some more control over exposure. The auto exposure was frustrating, especially with the face tracking turned on so I turned it off. It would go from light to dark depending on the angle of the face and it would black out everything else.External mic option. Great option if I want to get a boom mic type thing for recording kids games.Tripod mount. Got a mini tripod and it works great.Image stabilization. Worked great for me. My hands can stay pretty still, even when I'm moving so I didn't notice any jitter or jaggy lines.Connectors. HDMI port is great to connect to HDTV. Built in USB is great, used a USB extender cable like other reviewer since my USB ports are not by the floor or desk and don't want to hang the camera in mid air. Would have loved if the camera had an option to act as a webcam, or that the camera could record while connected via usb to a computer. Being able to store video on the computer hard drive or just as an unending power supply would be great. Maybe a firmware fix can add this?Video Quality. In good light, outdoors, the camera records great video on all settings. HD looks amazing on an HDTV. As you go into bad light, or at night, or indoors, the quality starts to degrade. You notice color noise and the auto exposure starts to kick in to help but it is too unpredictable with face tracking on.Battery. Not great. The camera is fairly big, and the battery is really thin and about half the size of a business card. They could have easily fit a battery twice the size in this. As it is, the battery doesn't last that long, maybe an hour. Get an external battery pack if you want to record, without changing batteries, for longer.Zoom. Not great. Digital zoom would have been better if it was smooth. And any zoomed video was lower quality. Obvious I know, but was hoping for more. Wouldn't use it as it is.Video format. Not great. The movies played fine on my computer, but my software to convert videos doesn't read .mov files. Why they would pick a mac format for a device that has software that doesn't work well on a mac is beyond me. Would have been great if they used a standard format like AVI. Needed to buy more software to convert the format in to something usable.Software. Not great. See above about format. The software is a stripped down version and only lets you convert the movie or movies into a few types, non of which are usable by my software. Only for converting to apple formats, playstation formats, or web formats. It is really easy to use to edit and cut clips together and make movies and can even make dvds. But it will only record dvds to a disc not the hard drive which would have helped.And now the deal breaker. I could have dealt with, or worked around all the above, but I got one of the units that has a very loud high pitched whine when using the internal mic. It was present on all recording modes, except photo. It is more obvious playing back on the camera, it lessens when played on the computer but is still there. Lowering the mic sensitivity to the lowest setting makes it almost go away, but then you lose people's voices if they aren't very close to the camera. Using an external mic eliminates the whine, but my primary use for the camera is with the internal mic.I called Kodak and I'm within the 30 day return window so I am sending mine in for a replacement, which they assured me would be a new unit. I have to pay shipping back to them, but I got free shipping before so I'm not too bummed about that.For what I need, this camera is near perfect. When the new camera comes in I can update the review. Also thinking about getting the external mic and power supply mentioned in another of these reviews as I want to record the kids games and think they would help out.As for the stars. I would have rated it four stars if it wasn't for the defect, assuming it's a defect. Without the whine, if the camera had any three of these: better low light control, better battery, better zoom, better software, different format; I would have rated it five stars. It's still a nice camera and I will be happy with it if I can get one without the whine.","September 7, 2009",
cameras,Good but doesn't live up to the hype,David,R3M67DHXAEQ90V,3,"Since other reviewers have covered this camera pretty well, I'll just add a few things that I think are important. First, as to the high pitched whine that others have noticed, I have not noticed this with my Zi8, and I've tested the camera in a quiet environment. It might be a problem present in only some units. Second, the 1080p setting produces very noticeable jumping or stuttering of the image with any kind of movement of the camera or subject. This is unacceptable. I have tested every recording mode and have found that the best results are achieved with the 720p/60 setting. I viewed my test videos on a 40 inch 1080p TV, and was surprised to see that videos made with 720/60 were actually sharper and contained less noise than those made in 1080p/30. It's also worth noting that videos made in any setting other than 1080p have a wider view or focal length, actually the same as the view width of the Zi6. The Zi8's 1080p mode, on the other hand, has a narrower view or longer effective focal length...not by a whole lot, but noticeable. Since I will be shooting everything at 720/60 with this camera, I tried setting the camera to 720/60 and notched up the digital zoom just enough so that it was the same as the focal length of the 1080p mode, then shot the identical subject and was surprised and pleased to find that even moderately zoomed, the 720/60 mode gave sharper and overall better results than the 1080p mode. As for the 5mp still images, they're okay but nothing to write home about. An inexpensive 5mp still camera would do much better, obviously at least because of the Zi8's incredibly tiny fixed focus lens. I give the Zi8 three stars because it's disappointing but usable, and a step up from the Zi6. Kodak is on the right track, but a lot more work needs to be done.","September 4, 2009",

cameras,beware the firmware . . . upgrade,"NS ""NS""",R1CNAINQ0QMF04,3,"I was looking for a great pocket camcorder and thought I found it with the Zi8. I also bought the Zi8 sleeve for $20 and an sdhc 16 gb card for $40. Amazon did a great job packaging and sending the items, but that's where the excitement ended. After charging the battery and doing the initial tasks, I checked the Info portion on the menu and it did indeed reflect the 1.06 firmware. Low and behold, I still had major problems. The zoom-in functionality on the 720 and 720/60 settings created an intense darkening of the screen as well as on the resulting image on playback on camera as well as on the computer. And then the graininess . . . major graininess with 'low light' which was actually just normal indoor lighting. After researching all these issues intensely through amazon and other reputable electronic sites, these same issues were supposedly corrected with the 1.06 firmware upgrade . . but for whatever reason, my camera didn't seem to take to the update. So then I tried to reload the 1.06 according to the instructions on Kodak's website, but my computer couldn't detect my sdhc card and I would have to spend more money on getting a pc card adapter. Didn't want to spend more money on something that was supposed to already be fixed. I then contacted Kodak online customer service (at 5am CST which was the only time anyone ever responded, and earlier in the day that portion of the Kodak website was down mysteriously) who was very nice, but after I had to assure him that I did not dump sand or water on the product, he almost too readily asked me to send my item to their repair services. After reading numerous entries about what a nightmare that was in terms of out-of-pocket expense, time and essentially not getting the issue fixed, I declined. I then asked him if there was a way to download the firmware directly through the usb port on the camera. Of course, the answer was no.I really wanted to like the product; I wasn't expecting miracles with a $180 pricetag, but I wanted the thing to work and for the firmware to do its job. Or at least not have to spend more just to fix an issue that should already be fixed. Here's a more clear breakdown based on my experience:Pros:-great design-large lcd-ease of use-lightweight-good enough internal mic for me-HD capability-great casual, fun camera for quick videoCons:-doesn't stand on its own; I would suggest that kodak include a tiny, detachable stand (and retain the rounded bottom!)-additional expense: $20 on sleeve, and found only ONE option; $40 for 16gb card-firmware update is a pain! even if your cam comes with the 1.06, make sure that it rectifies the issues! and if you need to reload the firmware, be sure that your computer can detect your card, or you might have to spend more money on card reader.Misc.-Kodak should change the plastic shell to more of a grip material like the Flip-Add a protective lens cover-Allow for the 1.06 firmware to be downloaded directly to the camera via its USB instead of through the memory card-Concentrate on customer service and consistency of quality on the zi8!!! It takes up to 72(!)hours for user commment approval on their website, and they can't take the time to make sure they make q/a on their products more stringent?!There's much more that I can't think of right now, but I would like to emphasize that I am not an advanced techie and that some of the issues I bring up may be par for the course. I still think its well worth the, essentially, $240 pricetag and better than the Flip . . . IFF yours works of course. I understand that the 1.06 issue could be specific to the camera I happened to receive, but I will not be exchanging mine for another one, this 33 yr old can't take the stress of another potentially disappointing kodak kurplunk. I am thinking of getting the Canon fs200. I heard that for a canon, its not the best video quality, but its within my price range and I really hope that it is superior to zi8. I will however, be checking out local electronic stores to get a good feel of the camera before I buy it!This is my second amazon purchase and first review, so I hope this was at least somewhat helpful and coherent!","April 25, 2010",
cameras,You want a real review?,username_5,R1LETDQ6XCFBL,3,"I have been using camcorders in a nonprofessional capacity for a couple decades. Currently my 2 camcorders are a Canon HF200 (please do not buy this because as of this date all sellers including Amazon are asking it's original retail price for a 2009 model when the 2010 model is half the price.)What I will be doing is comparing the Kodak Zi8 which I bought on closeout elsewhere for $70 with the Canon HF200 which I bought for around $700 new a couple years ago.You might think this a really unfair comparison, but I think it very fair and here is why:1. The Canon is a year older than the Zi8 (or same year depending how you count these things)2. They both shoot 1080p at 30 frames per second3. They both claim to have image stabilization.4. Many purchasers of 'pocket' camcorders do not wish to sacrifice performance, they simply want the ultra portability of the size factor. I think this is a point missed by all the manufacturers of pocket sized camcorders who routinely sacrifice performance in the interest of size/cost.Let's start with audio:- The internal mic is pretty good on both. By pretty good I do not mean it records pro quality audio on either. For that you need an external mic and this is one area the Zi8 sets itself apart from it's pocket sized competition. I suspect the makers of these small and relatively inexpensive devices think purchasers really do not care about audio quality. I think they are wrong. The sound quality of the Zi8 internal mic is quite good (don't worry about earlier reviews saying it was terrible, this was a firmware issue now corrected), but it simply won't produce crystal clear audio for any kind of video work when compared to an external lav mic for interviews or a shotgun mic for interviews or more distant sound sources while filtering out unwanted ambient noise (such as wind). In this area I actually have to give the Zi8 the nod over the much more expensive Canon HF200. In outdoor conditions the Canon seems to pick up every little blowing of the wind. The Zi8 seems to avoid this pretty well while still picking up voices 20' away. Not loud or with pro quality sound mind you, but intelligible. Bottom line:audio quality on both when indoors is equal, outdoors the Canon picks up hideous amounts of wind noise while the Zi8 seems to filter it out much better. With an external mic they are equal, but using the internal mic the Zi8 at the $70 I paid for it is better than the Canon at 10x the price.Now, the video:- Simply put the more expensive Canon beats the snot out of the Zi8 in this regard. If both camcorders are placed on a tripod and exposed to generously lighted situations they are probably comparable to most eyes. Where the Canon really shows it's superiority to the Zi8 and really all pocket sized camcorders is when panning or trying to capture anything even resembling fast motion (such as a child kicking his/her feet). The Zi8 will produce a noticeable blur in the motion while the Canon will not. Both are supposedly recording at 1080p/30fps, but there is a sharp distinction when it comes to panning or simply recording fast moving subjects.- Image stabilization: These days IS is a buzz phrase, but what it actually accomplishes ranges from nothing to astonishing. For the Canon, it's close to astonishing and for the Zi8 it's close to nothing. Actually, I am being generous. For all intents and purposes the Zi8 has no image stabilization. At 1080p with IS on hand holding the camcorder while holding the breath produces a very noticeable shake in the captured video. I found that using a tripod placed on my deck still resulted in some jitters from people/dogs walking on the deck (though not too bad). With the Canon, none of these jitters were present. Simply put the IS on the Zi8 is a completely fabricated marketing joke. Useless for anything other than draining the battery faster. If you do not want to induce motion sickness on all who watch your videos you must use a tripod with the Zi8-PERIOD. I really am not kidding here. It's just not possible to hand hold this unit at 1080p and not get a shaky cam effect that is really nauseating to view for more than a couple minutes. This is true of all pocket cams and it takes either a tripod or 'real' image stabilization to deal with this effect. The Zi8 has no real IS, it's nothing more than a marketing gimmick. The lack of true IS means fast moving subjects as well as panning is affected by a blurring effect and all handheld scenarios record a nauseating jitter. The 720p/60fps is better than the 1080p/30fps in this regard, but not by a lot. Unless you will use the Zi8 set on a solid surface, please do yourself a favor and get a mini tripod for it. Search Amazon for ' Gorillapod ' to find what I consider to be the most superior 'mini' tripod on the market today.- Low light: Roughly equal with a slight nod to the Canon. I was actually surprised at the video quality of the Zi8 in low light. By low light I mean indoor lighting at night. It is not great. There is no camera or camcorder at any price that is great under such conditions, there are only varying degrees of bad. Having said that the Zi8 shows oddly colored pixels where black should be before the Canon does, but not by much. For a pocket cam it is actually respectable (but again, nothing is great under such lighting).Field of view: This is an area I consider critical, but rarely is it even mentioned in professional reviews. I wont go into the numbers, but the Zi8 has a pretty narrow field of view. What this means is that the camcorder needs to be pretty far away from the subject to fit everything into the frame. The Canon has a much more generous field of view and in fact the pocket cams for 2011 all seem to be offering 'super wide angle' lenses standard. This is probably the worst part about this cam because there is nothing that can compensate for it. A tripod can compensate for motion blur (to an extent) and jittery video, turning on more lights can compensate for low light scenarios, an external mic can compensate for the limits of the internal mic etc. Nothing can compensate for the lack of a wide angle lens though. For example if you wanted to record a crowd of kids around your dinner table during a B-Day party you would need to have the cam 15' or so away to fit everyone in. Not everyone's room sizes will be able to accommodate this. With a wide angle lens you could do the same thing from 6-7 feet away.To sum up, the Zi8 doesn't really compare with a $500-$800 camcorder. If you need top notch results don't even consider the Zi8. Still, for the price, it's probably the best all around camcorder available and the better quality camcorders simply will not fit in your pocket. I wouldn't have bought the Zi8 if not for it's pocket size and it's now bargain basement price (I got it for $70 shipped). To get the most out of it you will need to spend another $50-$100 on accessory items. These items can be reused on any camcorder you purchase in the future. The items are an external mic for top notch audio and a mini tripod for stability. Really I would recommend an external shotgun mic and tripod at any price point, it's just that with the Zi8 and all pocket camcorders the tripod is pretty much mandatory to avoid motion sickness inducing video. The audio is fine as is if you are OK with 'normal' camcorder audio, otherwise you need an external mic.You can get much, much better camcorders if you shop smart and buy last year's model on closeout. For these expect to pay around $300-400 for something that originally retailed for $500-800. It won't fit in your pocket though and that's the primary reason (other than it's now closeout price) to get the Zi8.At it's price point the Zi8, introduced in 2009, is still at the top of the heap in early 2011. Even the successors from Kodak don't really improve on it's video quality at 2-3 times the price. This is a real gem as long as it remains available, but please do not expect it to compare favorably in terms of video quality/IS to a $500+ camcorder.Put it on a solid surface, with good lighting and you will likely be impressed. Beyond this use, more expensive camcorders that unfortunately won't fit in your pocket will kick the snot out of this and all other pocket sized camcorders.","March 17, 2011",
cameras,Sent it back. Twice.,D. Morrow,R16HEWOUUEEN9B,3,"Received the first one but it had been opened and used. Lots of fingerprints. Every package in the box and the box itself had been retaped with scotch tape.Received the second one and all was great after the firmware upgrade except:The zoom makes the picture go dark half way into the zoom unless in a very bright room in all modes expept 1080.Pros:I love the external mic. The sound is great with one.I love the ease of use.Picture quality, in most cases, is very good.I can fit a lot of video on my 32GB card.The price is great!I'm not a video geek but here's why I sent it back.EIS doesn't seem to do anything. The pic. is very, very shakey. With EIS on it becomes jerky.The lens should be a wider view. I have to move way back to get a couple of people in around the table at birthdays and family functions. This is the main reason I bought it.Pic gets grainy in med. lighting. But for a camera at this price it is still acceptable.But what made me send it back is the fact that Kodak knows of the zoom problem. I called them and they say they have no intention of releasing a firmware update to correct it. Instead, they release a new version of the camera with a better video quality, a wider angle lens and the zoom works. It's the PlaySport. And it's less expensive than the Zi8 and it's waterproof.I know it doesn't have the macro (I will never use it) or the external mic. But the built in mic. performance is supposed to be quite an improvement over the zi8 in the reviews I have read. Still, I would have loved the external mic. option on the playsport. But for the price, it has a lot of features.If Kodak would simply have released the firmware update I would have kept the camera. But they choose to screw over existing customers and come out with a new product instead. That's just wrong.I am going to buy the PlaySport because the batteries and accessories I purchased for the Zi8 will still work. Otherwise I would wait for a different company to come out with a competitive camera in this price range and not buy Kodak.","April 7, 2010",

cameras,Kodak Zi8 vs Flip Ultra HD ver 2,Pam,REMC9YEWYY5K1,3,"I have a Kodak Zi8 using a Lithium battery and a Flip Ultra HD version 2 which uses two AA batteries. The Flip comes with 2 hours recording time, the Kodak comes with enough memory for a few pictures but you can buy up to a 32 gb memory cards which supposedly holds up to 10 hours with at 720p 30 fps.But it doesn't help much since the Kodak at 720p at 30 fps ran out of battery after just over 1.5 hours of continuous shooting on a tripod. Solution: buy multiple batteries and swap them out. Other reviews said to turn off the autoshake to improve the battery.The picture quality and sound are not as good as my Flip Ultra. The Kodak does have a macro mode which my Flip doesn't, so you can get in close to read print with it, better than the Flip. I was holding both cameras side by side about 3 ft away - the Flip is sharper and the sound is better. The Flip does a better job autofocusing, keeping everything sharp, while the Kodak you have to make sure everything is in the same plane otherwise part of the picture is out of focus. The advantage of Kodak is that you can add an external microphone which should make the sound quality better than my Flip.I also bought a second Kodak at the same time I bought the first one and it would zoom in, but wouldn't zoom out unless I turned the camera off - defective. So I'm not so sure about Kodak quality. The ease of use of my Flip is better, but the Kodak is thinner, looks cooler, and has a fun joy stick. But in the beginning I had to read the manual to figure out how to play back video, while the Flip has a play button which is easy to figure out.The display on the Kodak, although bigger, is not sharp. My Flip display is really amazing quality, the same as I would get on my PC, just smaller. After downloading the videos. The Kodak looks like it is made for wide screen, and my Flip seems like it is made more for a regular monitor. I expected them to be the same size but they are not. The colors on both are good, but different. The sharpness and autofocus quality on the Flip surpasses the Kodak.I'm keeping both and will use both, the Kodak with a microphone and for closeups. My Flip for everything else.Flip Ultra Video Camera - White, 4 GB, 2 Hours (2nd Generation) OLD MODELI wish I could find a videocamera that is the best of both of these.","April 7, 2011",

Don't expect professional results from a pocket camera, and you'll be happy.Unfortunately, I had to return it. I was trying to replace a digital camera that was dropped, but this camera does not have a built-in flash.This made it useless for me, b/c sometimes I need to take pictures of houses where there is no electricity(and no lights).

cameras,"Good video, So-So Stills, Poor Editing Software",Daxer,R2D8STDHUIKNGX,3,"Just got this thing the other day and it's a pretty cool little video camera. My sister has a Flip and I was looking for something similar to replace my Canon digital tape camcorder which crapped out after many years. After reading the predominantly glowing reviews both here and in the trade magazines I thought I'd try Kodak even though they're not know for their digital cameras. After playing with this camera for a few days I think it will fit the bill although I guess I expected a little more based on the rave reviews.Controls are basic, easy to use, easy to access, and easy to understand. Good thing because documention is pretty sparse. More on that in a moment. I especially like the ability to quickly and easily choose between the different video resolutions.I'm a little disappointed at the quality of the still imagery however. Sure it's a 5 megapixel camera but don't think it will replace your digital point and shoot. The lens is just not there and there's virtually no settings to adjust. It is what it is. The images aren't bad but have a vague opaqueness to them. Clearly not on par with what you might be used to.The camera includes an HDMI (and composite video) cable which is a nice touch and allows for a direct connection to the idiot box. Can't pass judgement on the battery life yet but recharging it is no harder than charging a cell phone with the included AC adapter/charger. Thanks Kodak for not making us have to go out and buy them.The current firmware of the camera (available in the tools menu) is version 1.06 (as of 9 Feb 11). If you're running something earlier than this there's a firmware patch available on line. I can't say much for the User Guide that comes with the camera as it really doesn't explain in more than a few words what the features are used for or how to get the most from them. The User Guide itself references an ""Extended Users Guide"" available at the Kodak site online and provides the link . . . but the link is broken. I found the ""extended"" guide elsewhere at Kodak as a .pdf file and it's just a rehash of the basic User Guide. I would have liked to have seen a chart showing how much memory is used per minute with the different resolution settings. That would help with deciding how large an SDHC card to get. Speaking of which, you definitely need an external card as the onboard memory is negligible and regardless of what size you opt for you'll want one with no less than a Class 6 file transfer rate.The ArcSoft camera-to-computer software package that comes resident, well, it's a basic little package which would probably satisfy most users . . . if it only worked! The media player (no big deal) and the video editor (a big deal) both load screens that don't fit on your (at least not on my netbook) computer screen, leaving the portion with the controls hanging off the bottom edge with no way to reach it. This renders any editing or movie creation (including making DVDs) impossible. I checked the ArcSoft User Forum and found three other complaints on the same issue in the last three months. No excuse for this, ArcSoft (are you listening, Kodak?).One more little peeve: Other reviewers mentioned the camera is a little slippery and a fingerprint magnet so I ordered the custom rubber sleeve sold here on Amazon as an accessory. It greatly improves grip and has holes cut for all the entry and exit points save one, the USB-to-computer arm. So you have to pull the camera out of the sleeve each time you need to dump video to the computer for editing (assuming of course you have something other than ArcSoft software).So to sum up, this looks like a nice, easy to use digital video camera. The still camera capability isn't great, the documentation is a little sparse, and the editing software stinks. But despite all that I think most users looking for an on-the-run compact camcorder that takes great video will be completely satisfied, especially for the price.FOLLOW UP:Heard from ArcSoft Tech Support that the Media Impression software that comes with the camera will NOT work properly unless your screen resolution is AT LEAST 1024 x 768. Most desktops and laptops have this resolution (you may have to change your settings) BUT some netbooks do NOT have this minimum resolution. If that's the case, the software will NOT function properly and you won't be able to edit or create movie clips with the ArcSoft software included with Zi8. And apparently there are no plans to change this. Hey Kodak, would have been nice to know, eh?","February 9, 2011",

I was looking for something to replace my zi6 and managed to get this off cragslist for about 40 dollars. Compared to the zi6 its a modest upgrade. The zi6 is really outdated in video quality by today's standards. The zi8 improves on that and packs in more features. it can record in 1080p/30 fps, 720 60fps and 30 fps and WVGA. 1080p i didn't like too much as it zooms in more compared to the other modes. 720/60ps is good for quick action and sports but i found 720p 30 fps the best as that is pretty for web videos such as youtube and its actually what i use it for. A new feature that is included is the external mic jack. You can plug any 3.5mm mic in which can give you a variety of sounds depending on the mic. This is good for the go hard enthusiast and interviewing type i guess. The internal mic is mono and is very ok. You can adjust the mic gain input if you wish. The image stabilization helps a little bit but so much but its better than nothing. A tripod is this camera's best friend well you could say that for all the cameras in this category. Now those that are looking to do serious filming or capture perfect memories may want a well a real camcorder. This is a portable camera for catching the spur of the moment and its also good for vlogging. What i hated about this camera is it shoots in mov format. Kodak at the time may have not realized that mov is a mac format and unforuntately pc is still the majority so putting it in mov instead of say mp4 which is a more universal format may prove to be an headache for some (maybe most in this case). Fortunately i use a program called mp4 cam to avi which rencodes the mov wrapper to something humans can use.Now compared to the flip ultra hd. I found it came down to this.The flip has slightly better video quality but the kodak has slightly worse video quality but got it beat in features. An sd slot that can take up to 32 gigs, an external mic and choices of four video modes and it can shoot pictures but that is garbage. I know people say smartphones have replaced these little pocket camcorders. Im not sure i would want to use my phone for heavy duty filming and besides these things are cheap that if it breaks from falling no biggie. Now if that expensive iphone does that well thats a different story. And also a film recording is not the main purpose of the phone more like a feature. Remember this not a real camcorder its a pocket camera that is good for non serious filming. This in no way should just replace your avc hd camcorder. Absolutely not.","February 9, 2012",
cameras,Great HD camera but...,"S. Scheifley ""Texas Drummer""",RYWX8E8I6UA5L,3,"For the record, I was one of the first to purchase the Zi8 back in August 2009. It has been a decent camera to use overall. I do love the picture quality. It's not great under low light, but it does work well under normal lighting. Image stabilization does work, but it's so so at best. I mainly got this camera due to the external stereo microphone output jack. I've been able to make very nice audio recordings using mini-stereo mikes to go along with the HD video. However, my jack no longer works properly anymore. I've done numerous tests, and all I now get is the left channel. The right channel either doesn't work or it just cuts in and out. Believe me, I'm very annoyed about this. The internal mic does sound okay, but it's still mono. I've tried working with Kodak on this by updating the firmware, but it didn't correct the problem. I also downloaded footage to several computers (MAC & PC based) - same results. I've also tested the stereo mikes by plugging them into a mixer board, and they worked perfectly. Kodak simply informed me that since my Zi8 is out of warranty, all I can do is send it to United Camera service center in Bensenville, Illinois. It'll cost a lot just for them to look at it, and to me, it isn't worth it. So I'll just keep what I got and settle for mono sound. I'm not happy about it, but what can I do? I've considered the Zi10 camera. It's cheaper than what I paid for my Zi8 two years ago; however, Amazon reviews have been more negative for Zi10 vs Zi8. I guess I'll just wait for the next big thing in video cameras before committing more money.","September 27, 2011",
cameras,Spec's in question,jimman10,R2ZXDW310R32UR,3,Was watching some recorded videos and noticed that the TV indicated it was 1080i in stead of 1080p. I contacted tech support and they replied live saying that all recordings are (i) interlaced. I said but you spec 1080p and the reply was that only means Pixels 1080 and even the 720 is interlaced. I said that the P stands for progressive and 1080 is the number of resolvable horizontal lines and they said that is not true and it only means pixels and they hung up. That explains why the picture quality at 1080p isn't as good as Flip's 720p.,"May 22, 2011",
cameras,Not equal to first generation Flip Mino HD,garypc,R3R32GHE1L6B1P,3,"First of all, I'm not a technical wizard so don't expect a highly technicalreview. I bought a Flip Mino HD for my wife 3 years ago because she loved totake movies but couldn't figure out all the settings, etc. The flip fit thebill quite well, but started developing problems with the off/on switch. Iwanted to be sure that we had a pocket recorder for some upcoming travels soafter reading reviews on all the top selling video camera's, we selected theKodak Z18. The Kodak was half the price of the original flip, but when youadd the price of the data card and a spare battery it starts to get a littlemore expensive.We compared video taken with the Flip and immediately after with the Kodak setat 720P. The Flips picture was much better in lower light settings. The Kodakequalled the Flip's quality when set at 1080P, but I understand at that settingwe will use up the battery and memory space much quicker. The major differencebetween the Flip and Kodak so far is the lousy sound produced by the Kodak.While I had read that sound was a problem, I didn't realize how bad a problemit was. In fact, had I known, we would not have purchased the Kodak. I knowyou can hook up an external mike to the Kodak, but we bought this camera forsimplicity's sake, not to mess around with hooking up a mike each time we use it.I took a guess at the battery life since our use will be at the 1080P setting.In summary, the Kodak Z18 is fairly simple to use, takes very good video at 1080P,image stabilization doesn't add much, but we like the easy to use Zoom. Too badthey didn't focus on sound quality whatsoever.","March 11, 2011",

Outstanding quality for a day at the beach.","January 31, 2011",
cameras,Great camcorder but close up is lacking,Eugene Kolovyansky,R2T8M848BT8NHQ,3,"While we were very happy with the overall performance of the camera, one thing kept causing us frustration. The wide-angle range of the lens just required the holder to stand way too far back to get everything on screen. Overall, it's a great camera and if we didn't have to keep stepping back to make sure the kids were in the frame, we would keep it. Returned it and looking to get something with a better wide-angle.","December 12, 2010",
cameras,"Just Okay, not great",Carole C,RUR1B04I7PAMH,3,"Not a great one, just works okay. Video resolution is fantastic but under low lighting conditions it doesn't deliver.

cameras,Camera A+ / Kodak Support F,"L. Columbus ""lou1492""",R229I7Z3FGKEOG,3,"Camera takes wonderful video for the price. However, while on vacation, I removed the camera from my jacket pocket to find the protective lens cover had come off. After several minutes of fiddling with it, I got it to snap back into place, but it continued to come off with the slightest bump. Later on the camera developed a problem with spotting in the video and photos. After an hour or more dealing with customer service, I was told to send my camera in for repair, which I did. About 2 weeks later, I received the camera back, but it still had the same problem. Again I was told to return it and this time I was sent a refurbished unit. Unfortunately, they sent the wrong type of battery with it, so they had to send a new battery separately. The refurb works, but I was offered nothing for my time and frustration and was without a working camera for over 1 month. Compared to my experiences with other companies, Kodak ranks very poor. Hopefully they will improve in that area, so it compares with the quality of their products.","October 25, 2010",
cameras,"convenient to use, sound quality is poor",Ken,R184PCPDXHEVV8,3,"I bought this so I don't have to lug around my HD camcorder all the time to shoot video of my family. It starts up super quick, which is very convenient when you're trying to catch your 2 year-old doing something funny. Picture quality is good, especially given the price. It's really light weight and easy to use. You can easily carry it around in your pocket so you're always ready to catch that youtube moment. The only negative thing I found so far is the sound quality. Whatever you're recording has to be within a few feet of the camera or you can't hear it when you play it back on your computer or TV without cranking the volume all the way up (literally). I had one of the first generation Flips that picked up sound much better than this Kodak.","September 29, 2010",
cameras,Really like this camera.... but a few things disappointed.,"Gary in Sun City, AZ",RZHTSGB6YFJXI,3,"I have mixed feelings about this camera. If not for the ""issues"" I'll address here, I'd give the camera a ""4"" or ""5"". I'm experienced in photography, have my own photo gallery website on SmugMug, and shot VHS video years ago when my kids were growing up. I plan to keep this camera for the uses I myself have these days. It shoots good video, maybe just not terrific. But then after all, it's an inexpensive ""entry level"" camera.I had none of the problems some other reviewers had, maybe because my camera arrived with the latest 1.06 firmware. Directions for the camera are VERY limited. The included booklet, the Kodak on-line help, and above all, the ArcSoftware. Even going on-line to any of them gives sadly little help & direction for the new user. I clicked on help with ArcSoft and a GERMAN page came up, with no obvious way to get it into English. Is that stupid or what?! No corrections have been made by Arc days later, either.While I didn't expect video quality quite like the much more expensive camcorders offer, it was below what they seem to boast of and offer as examples. This camera really requires using ""Class 6"" SD memory cards. If not used the info from the camera shoots out faster than weaker memory cards can keep up with. That's when the camera shuts down or an error shows up. The camera's built-in mike records in ""mono"". For stereo you will need to purchase a stereo mike and plug it into the jack. Editing your video clips, it appears, will require purchasing additional software. At least my experience with ArcSoftware hasn't helped me there.Another issue I have is with its ""face detection"". This is a ""fixed-focus"" camera, the only choices being distance or close-up (5""-12"") controlled by a switch on its top. How then can ""face detection"" even be possble? How can the lens find & focus in on faces, with a fixed-focus camera? It cannot and does not. A wasted ""feature"" it seems used in advertising. If I'm wrong, someone explain why.The reviews have been pretty good about this camera, in particular the one from cne*t. This may at this time be the best of its kind. I like how it feels and works, just think a huge company like Kodak could have addressed these issues much earlier.This camera is greatly discounted, check around. And Amazon had the best price, shipped from Beach Camera, a reliable place.UPDATE 09/25/2010: After initial frustration I found a YouTube video which really helped me understand the program that came with the camera.

cameras,"Great camera, poor construction quality",R. V. Hatcher,R3PLLIC3YQQJ0O,3,"Enough people have written about the picture quality which is exceptional, but I wanted to touch on the feel of the device. The Zi8 couldn't feel flimsier. It seems to be made of cheap plastic and every corner has been cut. Because the cover is a very slick plastic it gets dirty quickly from fingerprints. Also, the cover is really hard to get off to get to the battery compartment. Why they didn't put some ribs on there I don't know. I had to put on a rubber dishwashing glove to get some friction. Then, the cover for the SD card is so flimsy I am glad it doesn't have to come off regularly or it would surely get torn off. The buttons for Delete, Play, etc, are very, very small so they are hard to press. Oh, and they don't tell you in the instructions that you have to press and hold the off/on switch for a few seconds to get it to turn on.I had bought the Flip Mino HD and returned it because it didn't have an external mic connection and I am glad the Zi8 has one. But, the construction on the Mino was much sturdier. I would be worried about this thing breaking in a backpack, or on a bike ride, and it would certainly not survive a drop onto a tile floor.Bob","March 30, 2010",
cameras,Eh....,Michael Petronino,R23QEUYJ2796JH,3,"Not terribly impressed with the Zi8. Picture quality is quite grainy for my taste. I tried 720p and found it quite lacking. I only shoot on 1080p now and it's acceptable. Terrible in low light. Don't even bother trying. I also don't like the ""auto-USB"" connection. I'd much rather have a usb input on the unit than the male connector that pops out.But it is extremely handy. Turn on in 2 seconds, press button and you're shooting. Plug it into your computer, copy the files and you're done. I'd prefer it record in mp4, but converting from .mov is quite easy.So if you're looking for good video quality (even in good lighting): pay more money. If you're looking to shoot quick videos that don't need to be perfectly smooth, the Zi8 is a good buy for the money.","January 5, 2010",
cameras,On the verge of returning. Can't purchase the remote anywhere,GB,R23VC7OM0IFEA7,3,"The quality of outdoor video/photo is pretty good, indoor is (as to be expected) rather poor. My biggest critique is that the remote control functionality (something I intended to use a fair amount) is effectively useless because I am unable to purchase a remote control for the device. Kodak doesn't have them and doesn't know if they'll continue the item... many places list the item but it is out of stock and has been for at least 2 weeks. Advertising functions that are then not supported is bad marketing. One chooses a camera based on quality and functions that might set it apart from its competitors. One expects that those listed functions will then be made available!!","December 24, 2009",
cameras,It's HD in broad daylight...,W. Sturman,R917FBRLG1LTB,3,"Think of the camera as fully high definition camcorder on a bright sunny or cloudy day. The darker you get from there the worse the quality is. In my house with bright lights on I found it to be worse then my standard definition camcorder when on my large computer monitor. To summarize other reviews the Zi8 has a lot of great features that it's rivals lack. One thing to note is that the 1080p literally zooms the camera in, whereas the other modes are wider. It is a drawback to people wanting wide 1080p HD, but it can also be used as sort of a fake optical zoom. When you go to import it into editing software you can make it all 720p if you want.Unfortunately my Zi8 had a ""dead"" gray pixel on it. What was weird is that the pixel would die and come back to life and die again whenever it felt like it. I decided to return the Zi8 instead of playing the exchange game. I think I will spend on a product that is built to last, has optical zoom, better low light, and more features.","December 16, 2009",
cameras,Kodak Zi8,FrankieP77,R2389U0EOFWP2D,3,"This is a compact video camera with picture taking ability. I love the memory expandability by use of SD/SDHC cards. This camera requires ample lighting for best performance so it works pretty good outside on sunny days. The problem comes when there is not enough light - the video will be very dark and the pictures are very grainy. You also need to have a very steady hand when snapping pictures otherwise they are blurry. Hopefully the next version features a video light, flash and maybe ""night vision"" that will resolve these issues. For this price it is a convenient little gadget for carrying around and not missing ""life's little moments"" but by no means will this replace your high-end camcorder and camera.","December 16, 2009",
cameras,Comparing zi8 to other camcoders in it's class,"Steve J ""TRUST JESUS""",R23YWVVW4Y1AOF,3,"I recently purchased the zi8 and would like to write a review comparing this unit with three other units I own. The other units are the Kodak zx1. RCA 300ezHD and the Flip Ultra 120 min 2GB(not mino or HD.Before I begin let me explain what I use the cameras for. I am not a professional by any means. I use the cameras for use only on occasion, the same as probably most of you reading this. I might use it a lot for a 2 week period but then I'll go weeks or months with very minimal use. I'm just your average person looking for a small camcorder to fit in my pocket, take pics/vids on demand, and all of this at a decent price.To start off, let me say that all of these camcorders are pretty similar to one another. Each unit has a feature or two that the others do not have. For example, the Flip has the ability to turn off the red recording light when you are recording. A nice feature if you are ""spying"" on someone. The RCA has a flip out lens that allows you to record yourself and see yourself in the LCD screen. A nice feature. The kodak zx1 has a weatherproof shell, making it ideal for some extreme sports fanatics. And the zi8 has the external mic jack, unique only to this camcorder right now.One huge negative about the Flip is it's limited storage. Depending on the model (I had the 120 min model) you are limited to the amount of video you can store. Once the unit is full, you must transfer the videos to a computer before you can record. There is no expansion slot - so no SD cards. This is no big deal if you KNOW you are not going to go beyond 2 hrs, but in my case it was a deal breaker and was sent back. The video on the Flip was good, no complaints. I would say it was near the top, if not the top, in terms of audio/video quality at the comparable settings. The audio was very good. I like the fact that the unit runs on 2AA batteries or a flip battery pack. A nice feature. I don't know much about video size but I do know all the other units, except the RCA, stores the moves in .mov or mpeg4 which for some reason are LARGE files. The RCA is in .avi and the files are pretty small. I don't really like the large files but it's workable. I would recommend this product to someone if, again, they KNEW they were not going to need more than 2 hrs. of video before being able to transfer.The RCA 300ezHD was the first camera I got. It is a nice little camera and retails now for less than $100. As stated before, one nice thing about the RCA is the flip around camera lens. It also has an expansion slot. You can get A LOT of hours of video on even a small SD card. For some reason the videos on the RCA are ""smaller"" in total size than all the other models. It must be a quality thing. Although the quality of the RCA does not match the other units, it is definitely decent quality. The biggest problem with this unit is it's audio. The audio on this unit is HORRIBLE. Very, very bad. I did keep this unit because of the expandable memory but the audio is really bad. It is by far teh worst audio of all the units. Where the other units are still easily heard, this unit is non-existent. You just can't hear it unless the volume is high or the speaker is close up. It does not run on 2AA but you can buy a few cheap rechargeable batteries which are nice.The Kodak zi1 is a nice camera. The video quality is comparable to the Flip and zi8, though the zi8 is better than both. The audio on the zx1 is not as good as the flip but not as bad as RCA. It's acceptable though for most any type of regular video shooting. The zi1 runs off of 2AA batteries, just like the flip. I like that feature. Plus you can buy a few rechargeable batteries to make sure you have enough juice. This unit does not have a flip out usb like all the other units, but that wasn't a big deal to me. Just like the flip and zi1, the video files are large. I don't know why. A minute can give you a 300mb file on the low setting. Again, not a big deal.I purchased the zi8 after owning all the other cameras. I would not say the zi8 is really better than the other cameras, except the RCA. The video and audio quality is comparable to the Flip and Zi1. It does have the ability to do true HD but that feature doesn't matter to me. I like the external mic option, which is why I bought it, but after taking some video with it, I don't know if it is really necessary for what I plan do use the camera for. The internal audio works very well. It does not run on AA's but runs on batteries similar to the RCA. A few extra batteries will ensure enough juice. I do not like the usb flip out on this camera. It is not rigid like the RCA and Flip. It is flimsy and seems like over time it might break. Time will tell. The video files are similar to the flip and kodak zx1, they are very large. The one big negative about this unit is that you have to buy an SD card for it and because the files are so large a 2GB SDHC card only gives you about an hour of video (on the lowest setting). So be prepared to spend a decent amount of money on the SDHC card. Although this is a good camera, depending on your needs, this camera doesn't seem to be much better than the zi1 or the flip, of course it does offer a few more features.All in all, I like the zi8 but again, it's not tremendously better than the flip or zi1. I'll be keeping the zi8 but for the money I don't necessarily think it is worth it, but again, depends on your needs.If you have any questions, feel free to email me at steveessie123 at yahoo.UPDATE:I have owned the zi8 for several months now and have been very happy with it. Although I still agree with my original post, I would probably give it 4 stars now. The clarity of this thing is great, even in the lowest mode (which is all I ever use it for). Also, when combined with a wireless mic system (kodak customer support says a wireless mic won't work...it will) this system is awesome. I would definitely recommend this unit.","March 25, 2010",
cameras,An okay camera for beginners,Kenneth Michael Mcneil,RAYJPGL378R0K,3,"The Kodak zi8 is part of a new popular type of camcorders. The ""pocket"" camcorder caught on with the flip video series. Their cameras are practically the apple ipods of the camcorder world. These are designed for taking video whenever you need to. The Kodak is here to compete with this. The Kodak zi8 has many, many more features than its rival, the Flip MinoHD Camcorder 2nd Generation, 120 Minutes (Brushed Metal) NEWEST MODEL or Flip UltraHD Camcorder, 120 Minutes (Black). This camera has a lot of advantages over these. If you are NOT looking for an easy camera, and want a more professional video, then don't buy this or any pocket camcorder. Here are some pros and cons.PROsVery Good quality (1080p FULL HD!)Very portableDifferent shooting modes including 60FPS 720p videoAbility to also take picturesSomewhat stylishMicrophone JackCONsHORRIBLE CAMERA SHAKE4x Digital (aka unusable) ZoomPlastic body (not good build quality)Can't do anything until a few seconds after startNot very responsiveThe quality is positively amazing for its size, so that is probably the foremost feature of the camera. The other shooting modes and picture options are also great. The reason I took away 2 stars is the camera shake. It has electronic stabilization but there is hardly a difference while using it. You may not see any problems while previewing it, but on a large screen it makes the video hard to watch. For some people it can make you dizzy.The zoom is also awful, It would have been easier to not put in any at all. Digital zoom does not adjust the optics at all. Optical is actually like looking through binoculars on the camera. Digital is basically just taking the picture and enlarging it. They have made it so you can zoom while filming but at 4x the video gets really blurry.As mentioned in the first paragraph, this camera is for beginners. You will not get anything professional out of this becausea) it looks like an iPodb) There are no options in the menu for manual things.c) EVERYTHING is automatic.The reason it is for beginners is because of C. As soon as you record the camera auto adjusts. If you would like a little control of your camera, don't buy this.Over all, the camera's HD quality is impressive for size and price, but it lacks any tools of a professional, or even amateur video maker's camera.","February 28, 2010",
cameras,"More for the ""Techies"" than the casual user","Patrick ""PSW""",R1ZAI2UDNP6S8A,3,"I just returned my Zi8 to the store. The issues: Videos downloaded to my Mac G5 (2 GB Ram) and well as to a new Powerbook Pro played in a jerky fashion. The firmware upgrade from 1.03 would not load into the camera either from the G5 or the Powerbook Pro. After more than an hour on Help Line Chat with Kodak (2 different techs) and using two different SDHC cards we decided that the camera was defective. DVDs cut from the video did not play on any of my 3 DVD players. Based on other reviews, I now understand that there are formatting issues related to making the videos compatible. This is too much trouble for the casual user and involves buying more software.The camera is very easy to use and the video is exceptional at the price. From my experience, however, one can only view the video through the television on the camera's 2.5 inch screen. (I'm not into posting on You Tube.) This severely limits the camera's use.","December 16, 2009",
cameras,"THE SIZE OF A CELL PHONE, BUT...","C. Merighe ""Charlie Boy""",R1YHWAIGEK7ZD2,3,"So, it's a cheap pocket camera, and that's what you get. The digital zoom is usually worthless, unless you have plenty of light. Zooming in indoors is terrible!!! The still pictures are terrible, don't bother.The image stabilization is also digital, as opposed to optical, so don't expect much there either. So the movies are shaky, and zooming in means losing quality, so zoom out and walk closer to the subject. It's the size of a cell phone, which is why I got it. White Balance can be weird at times. I got a short clip inside our bathroom to see what it would look like, and the color was horrible in the movie. Ours walls looked like they were bright yellow, which they aren't. So I ended up using a movie editor to correct the white balance. I'll keep it for a a while. But I like the idea of a compact camera, and the fact that it is the size of a cell phone is very appealing to me because I actually take it in my pocket. Sometimes, it's too intimidating to take a normal-size camcorder with you, so the Zi8 can be very helpful. You walk into an arts store with a normal camcorder and someone might approach you quickly with a ""sorry, sir, no camcorders allowed."" But you can walk right in with your Zi8 in your pocket, quickly turn it on, capture a quick clip and nobody will even notice. :) (I don't care for taking camcorders in those places, it's just an example.) I use mine to capture home video of my family. The file format is .MOV, which is perfect for iMovie and Windows Live Movie Maker users. By the way, I started using Windows Live Movie Makers until I tried iMovie, which is about a million times better. The combination of iMovie with iDVD takes you to a better world.","December 2, 2009",

When I'm done charging it and I pull out the plug and turn it on, it turns on but it's immediately locked up. I have to pop the battery to reset it, then it works fine. Does this every time, so you would think Kodak QA would have caught it.The video quality at 1080p is a bit grainy, but the lens is a pinhole, so it's amazing it's as good as it is. I don't think this is a good camera for 1080p, so if you're thinking of buying it just for that, you'd probably end up happier with the 720p quality.The video quality at 720p is great. The zoom is funny, though, zoom in and out in chunks, not smooth. That's the first zoom I've seen do that.I wish I could make the movies less compressed, though, there's plenty of compression artifacts in the video. With a 32gb SD card, I get about 5-1/2 hours of video on it.The image stabilization is pretty useless, it seems. I have a Canon GL2 with optical image stabilization, now that's image stabilization. It's very easy to shoot useless video with this camera that will be so jerky you won't even be able to watch it. If you have a tripod, use it.Overall, I'm happy there's a zoom, even if it does zoom in and out in chunks, and I'm happy there's image stabilization, even if I can't tell it's doing anything, and I'm happy there's 1080p video, even if it's so noisy you won't want to use it, because I recognize the limitation of the form factor of this camera. However, the locking up has got to go.--- Update ---It turns out the locking up was because of the SDHC card. I had bought a 32gb A-Data card (class 6) from Amazon, and it worked for a while, but now the camera doesn't turn on all at unless I pull out the card. I bought a Transcend 16gb card (also class 6), so we'll see if that works. Right now I've got a Kingston 8gb card (class 6) in there and it's working great.","August 29, 2009",
cameras,"Kodak Zi8 Aqua Blue, newest model","Todd Firkins ""XTV guy""",R3QGH03TACBB2Q,3,"The request to do a survey was timely, as I was getting ready to return the unit for several reasons. First, the files this thing produces are huge and difficult to manipulate, even with well established video editors like Sony Vegas. The file format is MOV and is a high end H.263 format. After a lot of experimenting, I found out that I could rename the file extension to MKV, and then VideoLan (VLC) would play the files perfectly. But to edit them, I had to convert to a different format. I have been using a program called SUPER which does a nice job, BUT, I'm unhappy with the 720p 60fps mode. This is supposed to be for sporting events, where the high frame rate helps to reduce motion blur. But no player or converter I have found yet can handle this frame rate. I have two young boys in a wrestling club, and the Zi8 is perfect to take matside to record the events, and freeze motion, but I have not been able to take advantage of this. Also, the unit claims to be a 5.1 Mpixel digital camera. It is marginal in outdoor lighting and terrible indoors, especially in fluorescent light. It does record 1080p, but you need a high speed SDHC card, and frankly, unless you can hold your little Zi8 perfectly still, nothing looks worse jiggly video shot at 1080p! This is a tripod only mode! I'm still deciding weather to keep this guy. I must admit the video shot at 720p 30fps is amazingly good, and holds up well even in low, fluorescent light. That alone may be worth $130 bucks.","December 15, 2009",

cameras,Good Pocket Camcorder But Falls Short On Expectations,DjPLaTiNuM,RVES6YP7ORVCT,3,"After doing a lot of research on this camera and seeing a ton of YouTube reviews that this camera was the next best thing since sliced bread, it was hard not to be disappointed. I really wasn't expecting a $3,000 camcorder but after looking at the stats and the price, it would be hard to fall short. The only thing I have to compare it to is two cameras that I own (Fujifilm FinePix S9100 and Canon Powershot SD940 IS) which neither are designed for video. However, they both at least shoot a solid video without interruption and don't yield bad results. The Kodak Zi8 is a fairly small design which is nice and fits easily in my pocket (roughly the size of my iphone) which I did like. The problems I ran into were in the recording firmware. I purchased a 16GB Class 10 SDHC Memory Card which I assumed would work great for a camera of this caliber but I was wrong. The Kodak Zi8 has issues with most lighting settings I've encountered so far while shooting. Unless I am in the sun and shooting in the sun, it doesn't even take 720p/60fps. It usually cuts off after :02 seconds of recording. I've noticed that in 1080p/30fps and 720p/30fps it does the same thing but can last a little bit longer before shutting off. The only format that doesn't have issues is WVGA which is not what I purchased the camcorder to shoot in. After looking online through some forums this is a known issue from other users and Kodak says it has a build in shut off when the sensor doesn't pick up enough light because it gets grainy with low light settings (which is understandable), however, their should be an option so that your videos don't get cut off in the middle of shooting. It's very frustrating because there were numerous times I was recording my daughter dancing around being goofy (moments that I want to remember) and instead of getting one full shot, it took three shots for one single song (so sad). I've done everything from formatting the card in the Kodak Zi8, on a computer, and updating the firmware on the Kodak Zi8 and nothing has worked so far. Another major downfall in my opinion is the very narrow lens which requires you to stand pretty far back to get a decent shot of anything. Ultimately, I am going to try to sell it or return it as I'd rather save up an extra $100 and get a real camcorder that allows you to control the settings and won't cut out in the middle of recording.","August 15, 2011",

I did some taping on a sunny day with hardly a breeze, but when I downloaded the video onto my PC there was a lot of wind noise picked up by the built-in mic. Wind noise is notoriously difficult to remove from an audio track, so I am going to have to do the taping all over again.The Zi8 has almost no built-in memory, so you will have to buy an SD card. Be sure to factor the cost of an SD card into your price.The battery life seems a little short.The zoom feature isn't all that impressive. The button used the control the zoom makes it a bit tough to zoom in and out smoothly while holding the camera.The outside of the Zi8 gets smudged pretty easily.If you can't afford anything more expensive, then the Zi8 may be a decent choice.

Set on 1080P. Played the MOV files raw (just dropped them onto the desktop) through quicktime. Viewed on work monitor, home monitor and on my 40"" sony 1080p set. They all had the same results. Choppy & blurry playback.I did a test of both 720 & 1080 with & without Image stabilization & Face Detection. I did not notice much of a difference with IS & FD. The video seemed unchanged whether they were on or off. I didn't like any 30 fps format (720 or 1080). The 60 FPS is the best format to record in. I found the 60fps dramatically reduced the motion blur and the video was much more smooth.The pictures it takes are really no different then a cell phone at say, 3.2 mpxs.In fact, the video, also reminds me of the vid my cell phone takes (lg envy touch/Dare). If my cell phone took video at 1080, the performance would be comparable to the zi8, or perhaps any pocketcam.The user interface, imo, is terrible. They could have easily put text on the screen to explain the icons. Very basic control. the Macro button is in a weird place. Macro adjusts whether you want to focus on near or far objects. I would imagine if you had to change this while you are filming you would hear the ""click"" as you move the slider and it would be impossible to keep the cam from moving.I just cannot keep this thing steady at all. Before this I shot on a Panasonic MiniDV and the filming was tight. Maybe a little too stiff. Was the panny THAT much better at image stabilization or was the style easier to hold which helped I.S.? I cannot keep the zi8 steady while walking at all.An interview with good lighting on a tripod, assuming the people aren't moving around a lot, 720p 60fps, is where this camera is at.Considering its price point, I think it would serve well for ""fooling around"" video.

cameras,"THECHNICALLY, it's a camcorder...",Anna,R1VJ3BFL1AM5DU,3,"So technically this IS a camcorder, however, I was greatly disappointed on many fronts - which I will address.Firstly, I am a stay-at-home mom and I think that the way in which I was hoping to use this camera is the way that 90% of consumers will be using it. I wanted something that I could carry around and use to take quick videos of the kids and occasional pictures so that I would NOT have to carry around a separate small digital camera. I wasn't expecting it to be like an $800 camera or anything, just simple and easy. Here are my issues:Camcorder - It is a camcorder in the sense that it CAN take videos. HOWEVER, you have VERY limited features in taking said videos (and even less in pictures). The actual picture quality on the VIDEOS is wonderful. I have no complaint there whatsoever. My complaint is with the stabilization of the picture. Unless you have the camera on a tripod, your picture is going to be shaky. On playback (especially on a television) it actually makes you quite dizzy. If you happen to be walking while shooting video, forget it. You have to be as still as possible. There is an image stabilization setting (it's either ""off"" or ""on"") which is useless.Still photos - This is where I have the biggest problem with this device. Here is what I expected: To just be able to get a clean image that can be viewed on a computer. No big deal. I know that there is no flash, fine - I'll take my pictures in well-lit areas; I know that I don't have ANY options for the lens (save landscape and macro mode) - fine I don't need a professional image, just a normal picture. The problem is that any photo you take between 2-5 feet away is BLURRY! Actually, a better description is probably fuzzy. I took dozens of photos of my children - all of which looked fine on the tiny camera screen, but when I uploaded them onto the computer, they were completely useless! They look exactly like a picture taken with a cell-phone. All I want is a clean, clear image - nothing fancy. When I contacted Kodak (on the phone for 1 1/2 hours) they told me to turn on the EIS (which was already on) and then they told me that they didn't know WHAT to tell me! I even e-mailed them 4 separate examples of my photos and do you know what they said?? This:""...unfortunately this cannot be corrected by a repair. The Zi8 is a pocket video camera and its capability to capture still images is just an added feature on this video camera that other pocket camcorders does not have. The lens type of the Zi8 is limited to fixed focus only while the CCD total pixels is only 5.3 MP.""So basically, they say that the quality of the camera is crummy. It's funny because Kodak brags in all their descriptions about the still images like this: ""Start bragging with amazing 5 MP, 16:9 widescreen HD still pictures"". All Kodak said to me was, ""sorry, but if you need help in the future, let us know."" I NEED HELP NOW!It's disappointing because the video quality is great, but you just can't watch them afterwards because it's so shaky and obnoxious. The sill photos are useless UNLESS it's a wide shot from 10 feet away or more. The things I loved about this camera were the fact that you could plug it straight into the computer and it could even charge that way; I love that you can use memory cards instead of internal memory like the Flip camera; I liked the accessories that it came with (cables to hook it up to the TV). I know that Kodak is coming out with another camera in September, but the description says that the still pictures are just 5MP just like their current models. Too bad. Maybe the picture stabilization will be better.By the way, I was able to return it to Amazon so I'll keep looking for a better product. Thank you Amazon!!!!","August 31, 2010",

Also had no flash capability. Video was same as pictures. I returned it after a couple of days and purchased a Nikon Coolpix S570 which is what I probably should've gotten first. My digital camera stopped working so I was looking for decent photo quality with video capability. I have a five year old and wanted to have something light and easy with me at all times.

The camera is quite easy to use and well designed in most ways. However, it is a fixed-focus camera. Therefore, even though it has good depth of field, many of the things you video will be either too close or too far away to be in good focus. Therefore, the benefits of HD are lost a lot of the time. Actually, the focus is switchable between normal (mountains symbol) and macro (flower symbol), but the macro position focuses too close up to be useful for filming people. Autofocus would make this a much better camera.Sony makes a similar pocket-size camcorder that includes autofocus. (I saw it demonstrated in a store.)

For some reason we will never know, the batter would not charge. We tried the generic trouble shooting on Kodak's site and had no luck. We tried contacting Kodak through their instant chat and got not only the same generic trouble shooting, but a computer or person that was extremely frustrating! In how many ways can you say you tried all the given cables before someone understands that the battery is not charging. I then called their support and was presented the same generic trouble shooting until she said I should contact where I purchased the product for their return policy. Now I know that all products have their problems, but I would think that Kodak would have tech support that was more familiar with their products and issues that may arise. A quick fix would have most likely been to get a new battery or for them to send us a new battery but we were instead not treated much like a customer that just purchased their product. Though this product would probably work great for someone else, it was a HUGE waste of my time.","December 3, 2009",
cameras,You get what you pay for....,A. Cusenza,RNGZJP4GEBX1R,3,"I guess I had to buy one of these to see for myself what standard of quality I'm dealing with. When a product claims that it will do HD video, and take pictures, then that's what I expect. There is no expectation here, I'm clearly basing my opinion on the products advertising. I don't understand how reviewers can hack other reviewers like they have no right to complaint about a product. What gives them the right. Trust me, these companies are interested in one thing only, ""Market Share"". If someone does not like this product and either has to spend more for better quality, or just realized that a unit half the price does the same job, then that is the ultimate purchase, to each his own!Now being an amateur photographer and videographer, and somewhat of a tech guru, I can be a bit biased. This is not going to be some long-winded review, I just would like to share my thoughts and hope that anyone who reads this will know what to expect when purchasing a Kodak pocket camcorder.So, for $100, it does a pretty good job of what it claims to do. But, how well it does it is where I'm going to complain. I originally watched the video on my PC, using the SD card. I find it completely useless connecting the Kodak with the built-in USB connector and have it physically hang down from my PC. USB wired connectors are small and standard, not sure why these companies think that users can't plug a cable... Anyway, video sucked watching through Quicktime. So, then I proceeded to download the movies to my media player (Xtreamer), which is connected via HDMI to my 1080p Plasma. And the quality was significantly better, but still very choppy. Grainy I can understand because the video was not shot on a cloud-lit sunny perfect day. I did not bother trying to connect the Kodak camera via HDMI directly to the TV because I won't be using it that way. If I'm not satisfied with the quality of the video in the manner that I choose to view it, then there is no point continuing. I will only sacrifice so much quality for size and convenience.I'm the type of person that would rather have a good quality 720p than having 1080p video for the sake of just having it. My belief is that camera quality stems primarily from the lens. And because I'll be shooting video indoors in low lit situations, I will look for or wait until a product satifies my basic requirements. And for this $100 unit, I really wanted it to, but sad to say, I will have to spend a little more.","December 20, 2010",

This is only true if you own a laptop or your USB ports are at the bottom of your desktop. I have a desktop and my ports are midway up the tower. Kodak gives you 3 cables. One for recharging the battery and 2 to attach to TVs. I had to bend over and hold the camera to the USB port to download it. I contacted Kodak to explain the tower problem and asked if I needed to buy a cable of some sort to go from camera to computer. Their response was (a) what is a tower? Do you mean tripod?

I suspect Kodak had so many returns of the first release that they have held back shipment of this product to address the issues others have discussed in their reviews. If it is delayed again, it may mean they are not able to solve these problems.

cameras,"Great Still Camera, but audio for video is unacceptable","Art Bay ""AB""",RCPW0L1IGZR02,3,"I got the 7d to do a project that was a combination of still work and video recording. So far I am VERY happy with this camera's ability to do still work. My objections come with it's audio feature for hd recording. Though I haven't fully tested it yet as I'm waiting on some proper cf cards, I have been able to experiment with the audio, and it's mind boggling execution. Coming from a video background I have really good mics, and fully expected to be able to use them since the camera has an audio input. However, even feeding a signal from a pro quality field mixer with high end pro mics the sound is plain lousy. Reason is the camera has a built in agc (audio gain control), and so it tries to constantly adjust the level of the sound coming in. Also I think the input itself is of an unbelievably bad quality (as in totally unusable). Now that I have the camera I've discovered all these forums and pretty much the only solution is to buy a separate recording device, record separate audio and video and then sync them up in your video editing system. I couldn't believe this to be the case and so I called Canon support. To say they were less the helpful would be an understatement. Their customer service reps are just armed with very basic knowledge and not much help. When I tried to get through to a more experienced tech person, after a very long wait they basically refused to talk to me. CS said the message they had for me was ""the camera works as it was designed"". In other words screw you and tough.In any event those of you thinking to buy this camera to do pro or semi pro or even amateur level above shooting the family bbq, I would seriously suggest you read the threads out there about the audio issue.

I have the Canon XSI, XTI and 40d as well as the 7d...After many shots in the field with the 7d I have found that this is a features packed camera, great for shooting birds at high speed, but when it comes to the main reason I buy a camera,and probably the main reason most pros buy cameras, which is image quality, the 7d offers NO advantages. Simply put, it's NOT worth the upgrade.

cameras,Me and This Camera Did Not Get Along,"K. Moody ""None""",R2HV05WAFBRLGE,3,"I won't do a detailed review of this camera, as other people have done a much better job than I ever could. So I will just discuss my experience with it.I've been a paid semi pro photographer for about 10 years now, portrait, events and college sports. I've also worked as a paid photographer for a multitude of marathons and other races that come to town. Over the years I've shot with a long list of DSLRs (Sony, Pentax, Nikon and Canon). I've shot with the Canon 20D, 30D, 40D, 50D, 7D and so forth. I was very excited to finally purchase the 7D but I was constantly disappointed by it.For one, it seemed a bit noisy at 100 ISO, much more so than any other Canon I ever used. Honestly, I got cleaner images (at 100 ISO) with my 20 and 30Ds. I spoke to Canon about this. Their response: ""Well, when you pack that many pixels on a sensor, that sorta thing happens."" I'm thinking, really? This new, near state of the art sensor with dual processors can't take a cleaner image than a sensor you made nearly 10 years ago? Really?! Ironically I was very pleased with this camera at really high ISOs. It was awesome at 3200. And focusing... My 20D, 30D, 40D and so forth seemed to take sharper pictures (and I always used L glass). I seemed to have to struggle with this camera to get really sharp images. I reached a point where I was afraid to use it on paid shoots because I never knew what I was going to get.The 7D is an awesome camera when you can get it to work (and yea, I read the manual cover to cover a few times). But I shouldn't have to fight with my camera to get it to do its job.Maybe I had a defective model. Who knows.On the one year anniversary of purchasing the 7D, I sold it and left the world of digital photography -- for now, anyway. Back to shooting and processing my own black and white film. I've fallen in love with photography all over again.","July 2, 2013",
cameras,Disappointing Times 2,Shawn M. Knox,R200OHE2DUH2MO,3,"If you are not seeing any noise quality issues with the 7D then, with all due respect, you have little or no experience with what the standard for a high file quality should be (shooting in jpg doesn't solve the noise problems with this camera). The 7D is no where near the best camera Canon has made and, in fact, I would say it is probably one of the worst bodies they've made, excepting that the camera does excel on the video end. There is significant noise beyond ISO 800, although the files are still usable, but ISO 3200 is the absolute limit. This is a very antiquated camera now when you consider that the newer sensors on a camera like the 5D Mark III will shoot clean files in excess of ISO 12000. The files from the 40D were just as good, if not better than the 7D.I had one of the early 7Ds and I can attest to the serious problems that the early cameras had with sharpness and focus. I got rid of that body a couple years ago. After the recent price drop I decided to give it another shot and bought a new recently manufactured body. While it appears that the sharpness issues had been resolved, for the most part, even the newer makes are mostly unimpressive. Focus on this camera when tracking moving subjects is still sub-par. When shooting a typical sporting event it is not uncommon to get a 50% in-focus burst when the subject is moving towards you). The center point focus is really the only one that is usable for moving subjects as none of the other focus setting can produce consistently in-focus shots of moving subjects, including the center-point expansion setting. Contrary to what some have proclaimed, the focus system is not so advanced that is difficult for the user to find the right settings, it is just that this camera's focusing system is simply not very good for moving subjects. In fact, I found that the 9-point focus system on the 40d and 5DmkII, respectively, were just about as good as the 7d's for moving objects. Of course, neither of those cameras fps are close to the 7D's so for sports they were not viable alternatives.This camera has probably been Canon's most hyped body and for those that had the mistaken impression (like me) that is was a viable and dependable backup to your 1D series camera it has been a complete bust. If you think this is a great body then that's fine since it is your opinion but I really think the only person that could objectively say that this is a great camera is someone that has never shot with a higher performance camera. I would take a used 1DmkII over this camera every day of the week.That being said, Canon is producing some amazing camera now, such as the 5DmkIII, which is worth every penny in my opinion. It's a little slow in fps for some sports action but given that the focusing system is incredibly good I would say that I get many more in-focus shots from it then with 7D and almost as many than with the 1DmkIV, even though that camera shoots almost twice as many fps.Let's hope that Canon does not release the 7dmkII with all of the noise problems the 7D has. If it's a 1.6x crop then you can't expect it to be as good as a 5D or 1D but it has to be significantly improved in relation to original 7D or I can't buy it. Given that the 1D cameras have all gone to ""full crop"" senors my suggestion to Canon would be to adopt the 1.3x cropped used in the previous 1Ds.Given current technology advances this camera is well out dated for a serious shooter. If you're enthusist then have at it but if you need to depend on a camera to help you make money, this is not the most dependable camera. If the 7dII is able to adopt the focus system of the 5DmkIII and at least borrow some of the clean file technology up to, say ISO 8000, then the new camera will be a winner, if not, the 7dII will be every bit the dog that the 7d is for more advance and professional shooters (my apologies to dogs for the insult).","March 13, 2013",
cameras,"Great camera, but heavy and uncomfortable",Alexander Boxerbaum,R1VBVQ8SMOACX7,3,"The 7D is technically a stunning camera. Compared to my previous camera, the 50D, this thing is a whole new beast.But with all the well documented Pros listed elsewhere, I'm going to mention my personal Cons:-Poorly designed grip: After an evening of holding the camera, I will have a blister on my right thumb. The thumb grip is way over pronounced. I have not had this problem with any previous Canon DSLRs.-Heavy: this thing is hard to lug around, especially with that uncomfortable grip.-Video will stop recording without warning: Some have said that this is because you need the fastest memory cards available. I have very fast cards, but apparently, they don't cut it when recording in full HD. I've missed several amazing shots because I looked down at the end to see that it had stopped recording with no warning.-$$$: for this kind of money, the above Cons are pretty serious.","August 10, 2011",
cameras,Beautiful tough camera. Low light/high ISO noise ruins it..,The Drifter,R2R4AKA83KC7RX,3,"I received the 7D as payment for shooting my buddy's wedding. I had an XSi and loved it, but wanted an upgrade (as a T2i would have been a lateral move). When I got it home and unpacked it, I loved the feel and look. It is a super solid, tough, very nice looking camera. I was stoked. I started taking some random neutral light photos around my house and yard (with a 50mm f/1.4 USM @ ISO 100). I uploaded the photos to my Mac. The photos looked awesome. crisp, and bright. After a while I wanted to take some low light shots, mainly because I knew the wedding reception would be held in a dark area with minimal light. I bumped the ISO to 250 then 320, then 500. Shooting random pics of my kids in my darker living room at night. Holy noise!!! Even at 250 ISO with my 50mm f1.4 it's unacceptable. I was mortified but I had the wedding coming up in a few days. In a nutshell, my reception photos were complete crap! grainy and noisy. I was able to fix a few using Lightroom 3's improved noise reduction but even then they looked like paintings because it over compensates. I talked to the camera store I purchased it from and they said they have never heard of the noise problems, and that I should bring in some examples. forget about even shooting at 800 ISO let alone 1600 and higher. If anybody who owns a 7D and has experienced the poor low light quality, please leave a comment. I just might sell this bad boy and end up buying a T2i after all...","July 12, 2010",
cameras,Excellent photographs but watch out for reliability.,Ron Carmichael,R1QW7NQ7I0S06Y,3,"My wife and I are not serious photographers, but we are serious about travel and we like high quality photographic equipment to document our trips. This camera has produced high quality photos and we have been more than satisfied with the images and even video taken with it. Reliability, however, has been a real problem for us with this model. We own 2 other Canon digital SLRs, several EF lenses and 3 Canon PowerShot cameras and this is the first product where we believe product reliability has been a problem. We bought the camera in late 2010 and the problems didn't crop up until early 2012 when the camera was out of warranty. Periodically we would get an error 20 which required us to remove the battery and reinsert. Although annoying, we got used to the periodic error and process for removing/reinserting the battery. By April 2012, removing and reinserting the battery stopped correcting the problem and I figured out that if I switched the camera from photo to video mode (and back), that the camera operated fine again for several days or even weeks before seeing the error 20 message again. We had a big trip to Peru coming up, but the camera was out of warranty so I decided that I could live with this workaround for the summer and that I would send the camera in once our travel slowed down for the fall as it usually does. On day 3 of our trip which was the day before we were to begin hiking the Inca Trail, the camera simply died. No error codes, no message of any kind. I had spare batteries, lenses, CF cards and no combination of swaps resulted in a message of any kind. I took everything to a Canon dealer in Cuzco and confirmed that all of my components worked fine with their display 7D eliminating the possibility of the problem being with anything but the body. Unfortunately, the closest Canon service center was in Lima and they were not guaranteeing a turn around of less than 7 days which wouldn't work for our travel agenda so we chunked the camera into the luggage and used our PowerShot for the rest of the trip. I know, shame on me for not having a backup body but in our defense we are not ""serious"" photographers and we've never encountered a problem like this before with a Canon product so we didn't have prior experience to draw upon. When we got back to the US, I tried the camera at home and to my surprise was met with an error 40 message when I turned the camera on. Having looked at various camera forums and blog sites I've noticed that many others have experienced either the error 20 problem (mechanical) or error 40 problem (power) as I have and it turns out I'm not the first to have a trip to Peru impacted by an error 40 problem.To Canon's credit, I sent the body to Canon Service in Virginia where they promptly repaired and returned the unit. The repairs amounted to $234 plus shipping. I'm not saying ""don't buy this camera"", but if you are concerned about reliability then caveat emptor.","August 17, 2012",

I should have waited for the Mark II price to drop and just bought another one. This camera is a great entry level camera, but not too satisfied with it as a professional use camera. The video quality is good, but it's no 5D. If you want to make films, shoot events, its good and will do a wonderful job compared to many more expensive camcorders, however, the 5D is still the benchmark for a reason. The crop factor is nice for long telephoto shots, but a pain when trying to go wide. The quality compared to the 5D seems to lack as well. And if you want a shallow depth of field, the 5D is the best.For photo, the noise/grain in this camera is unacceptable.

The choice wasn't easy, as Canon have not continued the XXD series directly. The 50D is now two years old. Instead of a 60D, last year Canon introduced the 7D. This is more like a cross between the 40D and the 5D MkII, and is rather more expensive, but at least it's compatible with my ES-F lenses, so after some umming and ahhing that's what I decided upon.Now before I get to the negative bit, let's acknowledge that the 7D is a very good camera. It does well all the things that other Canons do well, and I have great hopes for the advanced auto-focus, although I haven't yet found anything to really test that. I also really like the built-in level and composition grid, and the much-improved live view features.Low light performance of the new cameras is very good, although the improvement is marginal over the 40D in the crucial (for me) 1600-3200 ISO range. If you want to see what I mean, have a look at the full version of this review on my website.ISO 1600 shots will clean up well, and should make a decent print, the ISO 3200 shot is marginal, and will take some juggling to get a good balance between noise and sharpness. 7D shots at ISOs 6400 and 12800 will never be portfolio quality.The 7D produces good pictures. Its offences are against ergonomics and design purity.First up, weight. The dimensions of the 40D and 7D are almost identical. However, it weighs a whopping 80g more. That's all but 3oz in old money, or a more than 10% increase. Obviously my previous entreaties to Canon to ""just add lightness"" haven't yet borne fruit. There's no good explanation for the increase. Weather sealing has allegedly been improved, but rubber isn't very heavy. Maybe there's a lead weight (or, marginally more realistically, a tube of mercury) swinging around for the level? Whatever the cause, I predict a number of 7D owners becoming tired either directly of the weight, or the blurry images to which it may well lead.Then there are several completely superflous controls, most of which just get in the way. My bÃ¨te noir is the rear control dial lock switch. What's the point of this? If you're such a klutz you can't pick up a camera without randomly twiddling the controls then maybe a high-end Canon isn't for you. And why just lock the RCD and no other controls? It doesn't even lock the RCD fully - the latter can still be used in the menus. Instead it's a needless point of failure - my first 7D had to be returned because this switch had failed, and I have seen several similar cases on the web.Next, the ""multi-function button"", and auto-focus control. Functions carried across from the XXD series have a delightfully consistent logic: press a single button, and then the front control dial sets one aspect, while the RCD sets the other. For example, exposure compensation and bracketing. In most other Canons, AF is similar. Not the 7D. First you press the AF select button as before, then you have to press this fiddly new button next to the shutter release to cycle through the AF modes, and finally you can select an AF zone or point with the RCD. Why not just cycle the AF mode with the front dial, and the detail with the RCD?The ""multi-function button"" isn't well named, as by default it only perform this function and flash exposure lock. However you can, if you ferret around in the custom function menus, assign a much more useful function - triggering the viewfinder display of the level and composition grid. This excellent capability really needs to be enabled by default - why not on the wastebasket button, which falls naturally under the left thumb and otherwise has no function when shooting?The idea of being able to re-assign some buttons is a good one, but very strangely and half-heartedly implemented. For example, I'm never going to use RAW+JPEG button, because I always shoot with that combination anyway. Why can't I assign this to something useful, like mirror lock-up? Yet I can re-assign the shutter half-press to another function (from the absolute SLR standard of ""focus and meter""), which would be a remarkably contrary thing to do.Finally, what's with the ""reprofiled grip""? I don't know who Canon reprofiled it for, but it's certainly not men with average sized hands, who now find a painful ridge under the thumb pad where the 40D was fine. At least one 7D is going to have to be modified with rubber tape, and that's not good.So sorry Canon, I can only give the 7D 7/10, and I wanted to love it like its predecessor. You've got the electronics right, now focus on a more consistent, streamlined and comfortable user experience. You know how to do this - just look at the 40D.","August 24, 2010",
cameras,"[updated] AF system broken on mine, too",e40,R2O3XCP73P35HE,3,"I had high hopes for this camera, but it looks like I got a dud. The AF is broken and many (most?) of the pictures are out of focus.I did the microadjustment for my lens, the 28-70 f/2.8L, and got a value of -17. After that, the AF was still unpredictable. I'm using a single, center AF point, and there should be no question that the camera should be able to focus in that mode.Test shots after the MA show dramatic front focusing sometimes, other times not. I took a picture of a parked car, where I focused on the license plate. It focused about 10' forward. Other test shots show random focus, too. Shutter speeds are high in all tests shots, equal or faster than 1/125s.Is it the lens? I doubt it. I have a Canon D30 and the lens works flawlessly on it. I have 30,000+ pictures from that camera and I've never had trouble with the AF there (thought it is a good deal slower than the 7D). Ironically, the superior AF is why I upgraded.Is it me? I doubt it. I mentioned my D30 already. I can hear some of you saying ""...but that's a 9+ yr old camera."" Well, I borrowed a 5DmkII from a friend and shot about 60 shots outdoors at a picnic. Every single shot was sharp as a tack. And, the lens on that camera was significantly cheaper than the L glass I have.UPDATE 1/29/10:Amazon cross-shipped me a new one. The 2nd one definitely works better, though I need to do more tests to make sure. (It's been raining a lot here, so I haven't had a chance to really work with it.)UPDATE 7/1/10:Still AF issues. I've been increasingly frustrated with the 7D and I had started to dread using the camera because of what I'd find when I looked at the resulting photos. I did two things, borrowed a friend's 5DmkII to use with my usual lens and did a focus test on my 7D.Out of a 100+ shots with the 5D I didn't have any of the problems I've had with my 7D.For the focus test I used the timer and a tripod. The test subject was 4'8"" away @ 28mm and the aperture was wide open @ f/2.8 in Av mode. I used spot focus. I defocused the image and took a series pictures with AF. Then, I took a series of pictures with MF, using 10x magnification to focus manually. 3 of the 6 AF were very soft and clearly not focused correctly upon examination at 100% magnification. Under the same magnification, all of the MF pictures were crisp.I really wish I had done the test immediately upon receiving the 2nd 7D (work + bad weather meant I didn't use the camera much). I would have returned it and gotten a 5DmkII. Since I'm past the return period from Amazon, I had to sent the camera back to Canon--they received it yesterday, but I haven't heard anything. I will update again once they've done their thing.UPDATE 7/11/10:Got it back from Canon service. The email claimed they fixed it, but the insert in the package claims it was already ""performing to specifications"".I performed the lens tests again and found the same problem.I borrowed a friend's 24-105 f/4.0L to see if it's the 7D or the 28-70. The 24-105 performs fine.What really burns me up: I sent the 28-70 to Canon with the 7D body. They didn't even look at it, saying that the lens is too old and is ""no longer serviceable."" The 28-70 works fine on the D30 I have. I wish I had access to that 5DmkII again, to do controlled tests to see if it works there.So, I'm left with a $1500 paper weight (what I paid for the 28-70 10 years ago) and have to spend another $1000+ on new L glass. A very frustrating experience.Btw, I'm upping the rating from 1 to 3 stars. I still feel that it might be the 7D that can't focus the 28-70, but we'll never know because Canon refused to test the lens.UPDATE 3/11/11:I ended up getting a EF 24-105mm f4L IS USM, which seems to work fine. The take away from this experience is: if you have older lenses that work fine on your current (older) bodies, do not expect them to work on the 7D.I think that makes this camera worth only 3 stars.","January 17, 2010",

cameras,Great package except the auto-focus,#NAME?,R1TDADVVUJ78M4,3,"I bought my 7D a couple of months back, and it felt perfect in many ways: the build, the shutter speed, even the UI although it is a little complicated. I'm using it with EF-S 17-55 f/2.8 IS lens, which I transferred from me Rebel XT. Unfortunately my excitement about 7D disappeared as soon as I started seriously taking pictures, and especially when I started to view at the images on my PC.Firstly, the auto-focus kept on focusing without a stop whenever I was taking a picture of anything beyond 3 or 4 meters: I just had to turn to manual focusing before I was able to take the picture. Secondly the images taken with auto-focus (within 3-4 meter range) were mostly out of focus: the camera focused on something that it was not supposed to, or on nothing. Light or dark, inside or out, the problem just doesn't go away.Manual focusing is the solution for both issues, but it's tedious on on-going basis, and my wide hates it. I'd need to take the frame for warranty repair, but I bought it from another continent, so I'm just waiting to get back in order to enjoy free warranty repairs.

cameras,Great camera - on 3rd copy!,M. Howard,R2Y8R63W12I0C5,3,"I received my 7D at the beginning of Jan. 2012. I had upgraded from a T1i to a 60D, but needed more AF points and faster frames per second. I also liked the idea of Micro Focus Adjustment, having quite a few lenses.I absolutely love the feel of the body in my hands and it has a great feature set.After taking a thousand or so shots throughout the month, I noticed they all had one thing in common - inconsistent focusing. They were aimed clearly at a subject's eye or a particular focus point, with no camera or subject movement and one or two shots would be in focus and some wouldn't be!I'd Micro Focus Adjusted my prime lenses and this just seemed extremely weird. I also noticed that the AF points on the viewfinder were significantly different (offset) from what was shown in Canon's Digital Photo Professional software.I sent the body and lens (which was unused) back to Amazon and they sent me a replacement. When it arrived, I immediately took several shots in both bright and darker environments. Focusing was perfect, AF points aligned properly. I MFA'ed my lenses again, two were brand new. Everything seemed great, until when reviewing images, I noticed that most of them had what appeared to be hot pixels in approximately the same positions - even after using different lenses! I had a look at the sensor (with mirror flipped up, using a loupe) and didn't see any dust on it. I did notice that the mirror had a big smudge on it (but didn't see it through the viewfinder).Off it went back to Amazon and my replacement for the replacement arrived today. The AF points are off slightly, but I was told that if I send it back I'll have to take a refund. So, I'm debating what to do at this point. I'm probably going to keep it and, if necessary, will send it to Canon for servicing.","February 3, 2012",

cameras,Canon 7D It's Complicated!,Daniel,R25CSVH1CQ4M8,3,"I started with a Canon XTI Rebel, upgraded to a Canon 50D, both purchased from other sellers and was happy with both purchases. For months, I have vacillated about upgrading to a APS-C 7D and / or Full Frame 5D Mark II. I was looking for three things when I decided to upgrade from the 50D; 1.) ISO speed, 2.) Frames per second, 3.) AF points. Both the 7D and 5D Mark II offered improvements in these areas in addition to increased megapixels. After much research, price comparisons, and recommendations on Amazon's website, I decided on the 7D. After four months of taking pictures with my quality professional Sigma lens I had used with success on my 50D, all I ended up with were out of focus, incorrect forward and / or rearward focus, substantial noise at ISO speeds above 1200, poor sharpness, and soft images. In doing additional online research, I located numerous blogs, threads, and website devoted to 7D issues I was now experiencing from 2009! Most people state Canon refuses to admit a problem and refuses to replace defective 7D's they are unable and / or unwilling to repair! Why would Amazon sell such a camera with this type of ""black cloud"" on their website? Canon knows about and Amazon should have known about these 7D problems!I believed my camera to be defective!! In an attempt to fix the problem, I followed Canon's telephone advice and; 1.) Did a ""hard-restart"" which involved removing the main battery and clock battery, 2.) Removed all lens filters from my lens, 3.) Used a tripod with image stabilization in the off position, 4.) Used 6.3 and above aperture for landscape photos. In the end, little if any improvement was noticed. In doing an, ""apples to apples"" comparison between my XTI Rebel, 50D and 7D, the 50D performed better in focus, sharpness, softness, and focus select and speed of focus!Since I wanted what I payed for and not a $1350 paper weight, I called Amazon on April 14th and was told by a representative that I could return the camera to Amazon for a replacement camera for one year. On April 15th, I telephoned Amazon again and was told a completely different ""story""! I was told I could not return the camera for a replacement and / or return it and upgrade with Amazon for a 5D mark II and pay the difference. I was told I could return the defective camera for a 50% to 80% refund!! I have spent thousands of dollars on Amazon and they don't want to replace a defective camera?When I asked the Manager why his representative would have offered to replace the camera the day prior, he stated it would be a, ""Training issue""? Huh! How about, keep your word Amazon!Well, now I have a $1350 paper weight.Update, since writing this review I have been ""working"" with Canon. Canon told me the problem is all the quality professional Sigma lens I have. Canon told me non-Canon lens are not supported by Canon and should not be sold as being compatible. Canon told me to send them three pictures taken with the defective camera using a Canon lens. When I told Canon my quality professional Sigma lens were all that I had, Canon told me to buy, rent, or borrow a Canon lens. Canon ""claimed"" to have sent me a email link where I could send them my pictures. Funny thing is, to date I have not received a email link, over three weeks.Update, tonight, after following a Canon 7D users following ""tips""; Verify the AF in aperture priority and shutter priority using a single AF point and multiple AF points. It is also important to remember to set the proper Custom Function III. The AF on the 7D is better than what most people who shoot casually need and it has a learning curve.

Also, I have taken some day photos and most, not all, are in focus, correct forward and / or rearward focus, less noise at ISO speeds above 1200, sharper and less soft?I have been taking photos for eight years and never have been more challenged by a camera like the Canon 7D.

Great camera while it works. I had to have the sensor changed within the first year due to hot pixels. They came back a year after that and I didn't feel like spending $ therefore I took care of them by remapping. Now, one more year later, the auto-focus system works only when it feels like it and after spending another $200 to repair it (at Canon's certified center), it's only gotten slightly better.The camera has NEVER been dropped, bumped or mishandled. It's always been very well kept, cleaned and cared for. It still looks brand new. Needless so say I'm very disappointed in Canon. I should have known when my i950 printer went through 2 heads in 2 years. Or when my brand new Canon 50mm f1.4 lens refused to focus properly. I invested a LOT in Canon glass and that's going to hurt, because they're mostly L lenses. Unfortunately, I don't know of a way to take pictures without a camera body.

The new auto-focus and the added focusing points are awesome. It seems like the images tend to be warmer or more orange (compare to my 5D and 450D), which bother me somewhat.If you have the money, go for the 5DMKII. It's $1000 more for a reason (even not for the full frame). However, the 7D image quality is pretty good too.

First, the UPS person tried to deliver on the promised date (a Friday, the day before the birthday). But we did not hear him knocking, so he left a note on the door without delivering the package. Second, I called UPS trying to arrange a personal pick-up on a Friday evening. The time they allowed (8:30-9:30 pm) would not work for me. So I asked them to reverse back to Monday delivery, even if it would be two days after the birthday. They would not, saying I had to call Amazon to change the ""routing"". Third, so I called Amazon CS. A friendly woman put me on a conference call with a UPS representative. He promised that he would change the routing back to home delivery for Monday. They absolutely do not deliver on Saturday. The Amazon person offered to refund the extra charge for the 1-day Prime. Fourth, on Monday morning a UPS person left a phone message, saying if I do not come to their center (15 miles away) they would wait till Tuesday morning to deliver. Also they would not accept a pre-signed note. I had to wait by the door to make sure I wouldn't miss the knock again. To avoid further delay I drove 15 miles each way to the UPS center to pick up the package.I understand the security concern of requiring a personal signature for an expensive item (>$1,300), but this process simply defeats the purpose of a rushed order.

I don't know how he got in first. But I know he should not have got inside. Really poor dust or weather proof.2) I was not able to set shutter speed faster than 1/800 to catch a bird in flight.

I borrowed Canon XSi from my friend, and it took just 4 seconds rotate wheel and set 1/1600s speed (or whatever speed i wanted).

cameras,No substitute for an easy to use camcorder.,OkieBart,R12OE56LX14TZH,3,"I had always wanted to get rid of my mini DV tape camcorder, a very nice Panasonic 3 CCD unit, go with solid memory, and combine it with a nice DSLR just to save room in the old camera bag. Not a bad idea until you actually try it. I happened to be in California on a visit and went into a Fry's store, lo and behold they had a Canon T2i kit ""In Stock"".....I just had to have it. Tried it out and after a couple weeks took it back. So I'm writing this for those of you who like me might not understand what you are getting into if you want to use this camera for video.I really liked the camera as far as still pictures go....lots of nice bells and whistles. But, when you go to shoot video, you had better know what the limitations are before you spend a lot of money and end up with a less than user friendly video shooting experience. This isn't a camera that you can just aim at a moving subject and expect the camera to do the work. On a camcorder the camera does focus and exposure.....and all you have to do is compose and zoom that lens in and out.....and in and out....and in and out. If you have any semi-descent camcorder it can be just that simple........not so with a digital SLR in video mode. On the T2i (and other DSLR's) the lens is not designed to be a ""video lens"". When it is being focused, it is run by a motor or ultrasonic device, and it makes a very small amount of noise....you might not even notice it....but those microphones built into the camera will pick it up....and store it forever on your sound track. The work around.......turn off automatic focusing. So now when you go to focus the camera, you have to take your hand and twist the lens, same thing for the zoom function, and unless you are extremely gifted and can move your hand, wrist, and elbow without jerking the camera a little bit....that motion is going to show up on your video. The work around.....clamp it in a tripod......which is always a good idea for any kind of quality video. But as you can see....we are getting further and further away from the ease of using a handheld camcorder that can focus and zoom without the jerking and motor noise that you will experience from your DSLR video. Another drawback, is when you want to do video on this thing,.......you have to use the LCD display on the back of the camera.....no problem indoors with no direct light bouncing around causing glare. But let a little glare hit your screen and you won't see much.....and you'll miss the easy to use eyepiece finder on that old camcorder.....the one you could pull up to change viewing angles. And when you were using that one your camcorder was focusing for you.....and depending on the age and quality of that unit.....it might have been doing a pretty good job. I didn't find the T2i nearly as well suited to the task of focusing as I would have hoped.It's interesting to go out on the web and do a little research and see some of the Rube Goldberg gizmos people are putting these DSLR's in to turn them into useable video cameras......adding big gears around the lenses then hooking up a crank so you can get a smooth focus or zoom. Then there are the focusing loupe's, a large black rubber cover that goes over the LCD screen, it has an eyepiece built into the back that lets you view your LCD screen without the glare of other lights.Now if you have the time, money, and enthusiasm for working with these types of challenges, then this camera is going to get you some fantastic high quality video. If I had more time and a worthy project I would have kept the camera and played with it some more. Lots of young people are making some very cool video with this thing.But.....if you are a mom who just wants to take some video of the kids first steps.......you may be disappointed. This camera won't make that easy for you unless you want to hear the lens grinding, and see the jerky motion when you have to manually zoom, and see the auto focus hunting to get things sharp. When you take it outside to the swing set to film junior.....you might not be able to see a darn thing on the screen. So my vote is for a small flash memory based camcorder just to pick up those occasional moments in live when you want better than cellphone video. Just power it on, point and shoot video. Even though many camcorders can now shoot stills.....they usually do a pretty bad job of it.If you still feel compelled to go with a video capable DSLR.....make sure you can bring it back or trade it should you not find it as easy to use and the commercials make it out to be........maybe even take an SD card to the store and ask if you can put it in the demo camera and try doing some video, I was in the camera section of Best Buy the other day and the sales guy said I would have 30 days to bring it back....no restocking fee. Wow! Keep the packaging, documentation, and don't break it and you can take one out and see what I mean about the video options.Hopefully this might help somebody at least investigate the camera a little bit further before buying thinking it will easily handle video without any assistance.Good LuckOkieBart","May 14, 2010",
cameras,"Great sensor, but: poor ergonomics, no improvement by Canon...",ThomasH,R151D7Q3ZCZO0D,3,"I will not repeat what others said about issues with video pan/focus, I noticed the same problem and I would recommend to read the other reviews for detail. Lest stay with the central issue here, the photography itself. The small Canon's served me as a 2nd body, and this is the perspective of these comments.I am disappointed by the layout of the controls. Ever since I tried the small EOS-Dxxx cameras ('Digital Rebels'), I liked their small size, weight and down to the earth functionality. They were a great 2nd body for me. As the time progressed and the LCD display got bigger and bigger, the buttons were moved to the right side, and the left side is now devoid any controls. Now seriously, play with with your both hands and tell me: is it really convenient to have left hand useless and the all the controls placed on the right side only? I do not think so. Here Nikon, Pentax, Sony, Olympus, they all do a better job with layout of controls. The LCD display is more central and both hands can operate the camera more efficiently.My other issue is the inconvenience in M (manual) mode with the aperture setting. One has to hold the Av+/- button down and turn the wheel, but despite year long plead for an improvement, the button is still where the nose touches the display. I literally poke myself into my own nose when I use my 24mm TSE shift lens and have to set the aperture in M-mode! Why not to change this at last, please? What's the big deal? Nothing else would be impacted by using a different button for the aperture setting. Naturally, I never liked the connection of self timer and the ""Drive Mode,"" but here Nikon committed the same 'crime' against laws of orthogonal control design...I also certainly do not like Canon's change from CF cards to the SD cards. Now me and all multi-body users have to maintain two sets of memory cards... But, here Nikon users have the same problem as well. I guess, we all have to have now the secondary set of SD cards. Or maybe it's the sign of time? Maybe the SD is poised to be the primary card type?Other than that, once you press the shutter and see the results, Canon must be congratulated. The noise property of this sensor is stunning by present standards, resolution and price. One can even make perfectly well usable small size images with ISO-12800! Unthinkable a few years ago. Surely 2-3 stops better than even the top DX Nikon D300/D300s, the competition is in sweat. Even the house intern alternative EOS-50D is now clearly surpassed by this small camera. The sensor of this Canon is indeed on pair with Canon's top APS-C model EOS-7D. Only the controls are from my standpoint not well designed, but this is something what could be easily improved. Of course the quality of the sensor is the by far most important factor. I am sure all users will be happy with the achieved results.Another great improvement is the LCD display, finally on pair with what see in Nikons: Great color and the display can be viewed tilted or sideways with still excellent color fidelity. Older Canon's LCD display used to change color, or even reverse it dramatically when the camera was tilted.To summarize, I like the results, but I traditionally dislike the use Canon bodies for their design of controls. A subjective opinion, not shared by many Canon users.","April 26, 2010",
cameras,Really sad,Michael,RKIVGIVIA87F8,3,"I bought this camera four months ago. I love it. However, today I started getting an error message. Error message 20. I looked it up and it means that there is a mechanical problem and the shutter won't operate and the only way to fix it that I've found is to ship it back to Canon. I did some more research and found that it's a common problem, but I never saw anything about this problem while doing my preliminary research. If I had, I can't say that I wouldn't have bought the camera anyway. It's still under warranty, and Canon is going to fix it, but at my expense for shipping and handling, and there is no telling how long it is going to take to get it back. probably not before my daughter's third birthday party. I'll rent a body from my local shutter bug shop.There are probably a lot of people that do their research the same way I do, and that consists of a majority of consumer reviews. I felt obligated to let every know of my experience.That being said, this is an amazing camera. The image quality is great, and if you upgrade from the kit lenses, it's even better. I'm an amateur, so the complaints of it not being full frame don't bother me. it's done everything I've wanted it to until now. I look forward to getting my camera back, and I'll hope that this is a one time occurrence for me. I have my father's EOS from the 70's. It's forty years old and still works. I trust Canon. I always have. But something that you pay this kind of money for shouldn't break in four months.","January 6, 2011",
cameras,"Skin tones too red, video quits after 10 minutes at 1080p 30 fps",Dainius Juras,R2LCCKLZPD4LSV,3,"Many good features about this camera BUT the deal breaker was the poor skin tone images I was getting from the Canon T2i. Yes I corrected for the white balance as well as the tone and saturation settings but compared to the Nikon D90 I could not achieve the same natural tones. The second bug is that there is a hidden defect regarding the overheating of the camera's sensor which will force it to abandon your video capture. Mine stopped at 10 minutes 30 seconds, my friends t2i stopped at 2 minutes. Nowhere is this mentioned in the documentation. On the good side the camera is lightweight and the ergonomics are great with a great menu system, great LCD,comfortable feel and quick access controls. Never the less the skin tone is verrrry important and I did not appreciate the hidden movie recording problem so I returned the camera. There is a tremendous amount of hype around this unit but it could not deliver the basic fundamental skin tone quality expected in this price and hype range. Further not disclosing the heating problem limiting the video capture leaves me feeling that Canon is not as honorable as I expect them to be. Overall this camera is a 7 on 10 as its hype does not live up to its expensive price tag.","October 25, 2010",

I love the sensitivity and lack of noise of the sensor, great new display, and the movies are really crisp.","August 7, 2010",
cameras,"good image quality, a few serious problems",GearGuy,R21609IY246MQZ,3,"I'm pleased with the image quality, however there is one huge interface issue which has me tearing my hair out every time I use this camera.. all settings return to factory settings when the camera shuts off. I want the camera to always bracket the exposure, -1, then normal, then +1. I set this up using the bracketing feature but every time the camera is shut off it 'forgets' this setting and all others. I have to set up the bracketing every singe time. So frustrating.Another problem is the focusing. When I select only the center focus zone, it does NOT focus on what is exactly in the center of the frame (beneath the glowing dot) Rather it focuses on the center AREA of the frame, for example on the background behind the face in the center of the screen. This leads to many missed shots. There seems to be no way to force the camera to focus exactly on a point, only on an area (and rather large one) of the field of view. As a workaround I leave all zones active and refocus over and over until the dot above my subject indicates that zone is focused. Works most the time.Thirdly, Canon chose external rotation for their standard 18-55 lens. This means the outer barrel rotates as the lens focuses. This makes using a circular polarizer very frustrating; it has to be reset every time the lens refocuses.Update: more comments:Great camera overall, My choice was this or the comparable Nikon and I went with Canon based on the menu format (picture quality seems about the same). Well, after using it heavily for a couple years I must comment on what I consider some software flaws. For example, one which other reviewers can evidently live with, but annoys the HECK out of me- when switched off the camera forgets all the customized setup steps previously entered. For example, say you want to set a bracketed exposure, three shots at -1stop, 0, +1stop. Setting this up takes several clicks and wheel rotations. But when the camera is powered off then on again, that setup and all others are forgotten. The bracket then needs to be set up all over again, and again, and again, and again. I suppose this could be considered a 'feature' in that the camera 'resets itself'. But then at least provide one 'user setting' which DOES keep all customization.Hopefully Canon will add/fix this with a software upgrade so the camera can simply remember the user's preferred settings.There are other small annoyances like the flash popping up in broad daylight and in other totally inappropriate lighting conditions, and a focus issue wherein camera literally refuses to take a shot when the focus can not be set perfectly. I would much rather it just take its best guess and shoot instead of indefinitely trying to get it perfect.. It's like a scene from top gun or something with me furiously thinking 'TAKE THE SHOT TAKE THE SHOT!' but the camera just will not fire the shutter. Sooo frustrating..There are others as well; but you get the idea. Great camera hardware potential, in need of better software. These are all software issues which could be solved in a firmware upgrade.","September 8, 2012",

cameras,Super camera; horrible kit lens,"Andrew Ries ""arries12""",R3VLRPNGXIQ1NR,3,"Everything about the T2i BODY is superb (for the price); the kit lens is absolutely horrible. Bottom line: the images are noticeably out of focus even without zooming in, which means either the lens is of insufficient quality (even for a $100 kit lens) or the camera has a defective sensor (unlikely but I will know soon). I have previously owned a Nikon D60 and a Nikon D90 (a comparably priced camera these days) and neither had auto-focus issues with their kit lenses.NOTE: I am an above-average ""amateur photographer"", but a National Geographic photographer on the national mall just took a host of photos with my camera for me and had the same problem with the autofocus, even in the kit lens's ""sweet spot"" taking a stationary portrait. Trust me, not a settings issue or photographer error.I am returning the kit tomorrow to Best Buy and testing it with a quality zoom lens; if I still get poor images, I will revise this review to 1-star and recommend people wait until Nikon releases their HD autofocusing replacement for the D90, whenever that is.Until then, I would advise readers to BUY A T2i.... just don't buy the kit. Put that extra $100 towards whatever zoom lens you can afford, or buy a couple cheap fixed focal length lenses (like the $99 Canon 50mm/f1.8 II) and best of luck!","April 3, 2010",

It will give you the same exact controls and quality as 5D Mark II for a fraction of the cost. It behaves just like any other professional movie camera out there: full control over the exposure, manual focusing (the only way to shoot real movies), and the choice of the best lenses out there.For stills, I don't like it. It has too many nasty little problems like having problems to resolve tiny details in shadows or in contrast light (middle age people look REALLY OLD when you photograph them with this camera because it makes the face wrinkles so pronounced), and I don't care for the skin tone rendition (well known issue and I subscribe to it). Older Canon cameras, starting from 10D up to 40D didn't have these problems. But they didn't have these video capabilities either and that's exactly what makes it a tough call. Get 40D for stills and T2I (550D) for video and you'll be golden. Oh, and one more thing. The T2i usually renders blue eyes as colorless gray in natural light. A deal breaker for me, because my entire family is blue-eyed. Hope this helps.PS: 5D Mark II, 60D, T3i (600D) all suffer from the same little weaknesses: no ability to resolve tiny detail in shadows; un-natural skin tones; heavy dependence on perfect lighting in order to get acceptable color and detail rendition.

Canon's Technical Support Staff, absoloutely insists, that the problem, is, that the Class 10 Memory Card, that I am using, is not consistent, in maintaing, the camera's, minimal write speed, which is, Class # 6, and, that it is, actually, slowing down, below the required minimal level, of Class # 6, while in use, and causing, the camera unit, to shut it's Video Mode off. The only answer to this, they tell me, is to, purchase, and to use, only, a Class # 6, Memory Card. Which will consistently write at the required Class 6 speed, and allow the Camera's Video Unit to function. The cameras Manual, says to use a memory card, of at least, Class # 6; the tech's are saying, that many of the Class # 10 cards, which their Lab has tested, actually dip, to less, than, class # 6, in the course of actual useage! And that Canon has measured this in their labs. I am not happy about this, being limited to only the older, and harder to find Class # 6 cards! My camera is now beyond the warranty period.

cameras,Below Par Camera,JayBird23,R1SSZGYKE3T62H,3,"Warning: Don't look this camera up online or on Youtube because you will be sold at all the good reviews and great videos you see. I'd get a Panasonic GH2 if I had the money. Its a few hundred more but better video quality. Or a HDHero2.This camera is a few hundred dollars overpriced in my opinion. The Canon $75 Canon HD Powershot takes just as good of pictures. Only the HD video is different. I tried doing a little work with it, charging people for videos, and it turned out pretty bad with the lenses I used. The lenses I bought were the basic kit lens which came with the package, and a 75-355mm. You really have to get great lenses for the T2i to be worth it. Don't do the kit lens or the $100 75-200mm lens at all. Save up and get a better lens. The 75-200mm is ok but the kit lens pretty much sucks for videos. It's just not worth $700.I got this camera thinking it was going to be outstanding for the price and I'm not convinced yet. Its a plastic camera and very basic. The different shot modes really don't change the picture all that much, if at all. You can get some good shots from this camera but the quality is hit and miss. It's not all that great. You can get some really good pics, but mostly you get really average shots. You gotta ""milk"" the camera for a good shot. It almost reminds me of a kids toy camera. It's sad they charge so much for these things, but I guess camera sales is a lucrative business.I used to own a Nikon D70 and even though the body on that camera was primitive it took beautiful shots. I sold it when I got this one :( My gf's iphone takes better pictures to tell you the straight up truth.I will give this product a 5/10 because its so cheap. It can potentially record really nice video if you know what you are doing, BUT, unless you have at least a 16GB level 10 SD memory card you won't be able to record longer than 1 or 2 minutes. And you have to have great lighting. It does not perform well in low light situations. It's decent in the sunlight or well lit rooms, but low light SUCKS.The camera turns off every 12 minutes when you are recording so you have to watch out for that or turn it off and on in between takes and different shots. It can be frustrating to have the camera turn off on you while you are filming a scene. (I shot a few short videos for videography class).-Oh and for the haters who are arguing with me: I took a Photography course a few months before buying this camera, as well as a videography course. I know how to work it.-I converted 2 HQ 24FPS 1080p HD quality videos and they lost A LOT of pixels and resolution during conversion and rendering. And I used a Mac OSX to do it on. Can't even imagine what my little Dell PC with 1GB of Ram would do to the video quality :pThe battery doesn't last too long either. In HD video mode it lasts about 10-15 minutes of straight shooting. Bring an extra battery or two with you on shoots if you do buy it for the video aspect because it will go through batteries quick.Conclusion: Its a plastic camera that works, but isn't nearly the best quality or even the quality it advertises for. For a person who has $700 to blow it may work out for you, but I think you can find a better camera for the price. I just don't have the money to waste finding the best deal, and good luck finding the truth about these. I researched for months before I made the decision to buy this one and it's NOT easy going. They all make great claims and who knows if the video they shoot with is even from this camera. The problem with camera shopping is it seems like nobody tells you the straight up truth about what is the best camera for the price. I'm sure there are better cameras out there for under $700 but I have no clue how to find out without talking to someone who has owned a ton of cameras and isn't selling you something. -Don't trust Ken Rockwell either.

cameras,Disappointed,E. Lacey,R1AOHY2AZ7YSK8,3,"I have been looking for a small point-and-shoot camera for quite some time to complement my Canon 30D. After lots of research, I settled on the Lumix DMC-ZS7. This is my first digital point-and-shoot camera.What I like about this camera...1. Really nice, compact size with a large, bright LCD screen.2. Love the GPS tagging3. High quality video4. Fairly easy to set up and simple menu options5. Very good photos outdoorsWhat I do not like about this camera...1. Poor quality indoor photos2. Cannot review photo without switching camera from ""record"" mode to ""play"" mode3. Weak flashMy motivation to purchase a point and shoot was primarily for indoor photos at parties, etc., where the light is generally not great. I had 2 occasions to use this camera in these situations and it did not do a great job in either case. I primarily used the camera in its iAuto mode, which I realize is often not the best mode to use for ANY digital camera. However, I am really looking for a camera where it has a decent auto mode so I don't have to think about the photo and can just shoot. The photos I was getting using iAuto were really poor. LOTS of noise at most ISO levels, and basically unusable at ISOs above 400 when focus distance was over 10 feet or so. When focal distance was under 10 feet, or when shooting in well lit situations, this camera did a good job. I also shot in Program mode, whose only advantage was that I could define the upper end of the allowable ISO adjustment. However, given that I was getting unacceptable noise starting at 400, and it was difficult to shoot indoors at under 400, I didn't get much better results in that mode. I also shot in aperture and shutter priority modes, with mixed results.My other complaints with the camera are minor, and likely apply to just about all point-and-shoot cameras. I don't like having the toggle the camera into a separate mode to review the photos that I have taken. The flash has a rather limited reach-- under 10 feet I would guess.Ultimately, I have decided to return the camera. The high noise photos in indoor situations is just not acceptable to me. I will echo another reviewer here who stated that if you are a current digital SLR camera owner, then you probably will be disappointed with this camera.","June 15, 2010",
cameras,Poor indoor picture qulity,Victor Gavrilenko,R29HXCXOSSR76M,3,"I owned this camera for about a month and still own its predecessor ZS3 for a year+. This camera takes amazing outdoor pictures when there is enough light. Indoor pictures are not as sharp and color balance is not always right. It is almost impossible to take a nice indoor picture of a group of people with flash or not. This is the main reason I will be returning this camera. Also in some cases camera gets confused which lighting mode to use for indoor shots (incandescent light or other), and takes pictures with over-saturated yellow/orange color. The next picture of the same scene may get the right color mode.Another camera flaw comes from large lenses diameter, which results in longer circumference of lens mechanism and a greater chance of sand and dust getting into the camera through lenses. After one year of using similar camera ZS3 I can clearly see dust particles under lenses glass. If not careful with dust, camera can die after 1000-2000 pictures, Panasonic would send a replacement which will last another 1000-2000 pictures. It is important to carry this camera only in a case and never in a pocket/bag/purse even for short periods of time.","December 11, 2010",
cameras,Great as long as you're outdoors,"Kelly from GA ""kellybethga""",R2MQ96U93FVKYR,3,"I just purchased a sidekick camera to my olympus e-pl1 and tested the zs7. I sold my tz5 on ebay not long ago, and would describe it as the most aggravating, frustrating camera EVER to use in low light. If you're a parent preparing to take lots of kid photos, which happens a lot at birthday parties and such, please make sure to try this camera out to make sure it fits your tastes before buying. The zs7 is better than the tz5. However, if you like to use full-auto mode, the camera prefers to choose indoor portrait mode, which ups the ISO and uses flash, and if the subject is more than, say, 3 feet away, you'll get day-glo kids. Using P mode and choosing WB doesn't help much. Even in its best pictures, it chose to make blue eyes greensish.The zs7 does have its good points - it takes great movies and its pictures are very sharp (unless you go up in ISO). It's responsive and has a 12x zoom, way out from a high angle. If you primarily shoot anything but people, this is a nice camera.","July 31, 2010",
cameras,Very nice camera but beware image quality,"Steven Brys ""Koala Lover!""",R1GY2AVGISXBUK,3,"I own way too many cameras as I love to try them out to see if a particular one is ""it"" - the perfect small camera. There are a lot of nice things about the ZS7. Like many have mentioned, it sports a terrific range in a small form factor (25-300mm). It offers complete manual, automatic, or anywhere in between shooting options. There are a host of nice scene modes that are fun to experiment with ranging from common ones like beach, snow, candlelight to more artistic ones such as dynamic range and pinhole photography. Just about every bell and whistle on the market, are on this camera and then some.For me, however, the bottom line is image quality. Now you must have realistic expectations. After all, this is a small point and shoot camera with a small sensor and there is no way it is a substitute for a dslr, or a micro 4/3 camera. The trade off is you don't have to change (or pay for) expensive lenses, the camera is tiny and can go everywhere. Basically your investment of time or money ends at the purchase price. But I gave this camera 3 stars because I felt even within the peer group, the image quality is noticeably poor. Noise is evident even at the lowest ISO setting of 80. Because of this, the noise reduction within the camera is heavy and the details get smeared and hence, lost. You can lower the noise reduction setting but you cannot shut it off. And shooting Raw is not supported, so there is a limited ability to even work around this issue.Now, many people will not notice or care. If you are looking for a snap shooter, convenient, latest technology, and that long zoom range this camera deserves serious consideration. But for me the poor image quality overwhelms the many positive aspects of this camera.","November 27, 2010",

When I mean atrocious you can't take even decent looking pictures indoors even during daytime with plenty of light. Why would somebody buy a camera that takes only good outdoor pictures when 50% of your pictures will typically be indoors?All the other features of this camera are good.But beware of the quality of pictures.

cameras,Wanted to love it...,David H. Rodgers,RN3LNBE2LX6PX,3,"I really wanted to love this camera after reading and watching many reviews on it. It takes very good pictures although the highlights are often blown out more than they should be. My main gripe is the video and its format avchd lite, it is not easy to work with and you must purchase a video editing program if you want to do anything more than the ordinary stuff its included cd gives you. Unlike regular avchd formatted cameras the video will not open and play in most players. I also found the video to be too bright in the auto mode same as the pictures. Panasonic needs to keep working on this camera it is just not there yet. I returned mine and will go with something else.","June 7, 2010",
cameras,The not so perfect Camera for the Field!,Brad F. Cooper,R2FULA6QHG0UXN,3,"Being a field biologist and an armature nature photographer I thought this camera would be great because...1) Megazoom, Leica lens2) Compact sizeMy previous camera was a Panasonic FZ5 (Awesome camera for my needs) which replaced the Nikon 4300.Last fall (2009) my FZ5 finally failed and it would cost more money than it was worth to fix it. So I started the search for a replacement. If I was smart I would have just replaced it with another FZ series camera and be done with it. However, I wanted a camera that was smaller and still had the same features as my FZ5. After months of research and resizing that the 2010 field season was coming up I needed to make a decision. So I chose the Panasonic DMC-TZ10/ZS7, because of its small size and megazoom, Leica lens. Some of the reviews complained about the battery life, the GPS, and video features this camera provided. I however, did not care about the GPS and video functions since that's what the Trimble/Garmin are for. As for batteries, I always carry 2-3 extra batteries with me because when I am in the field I have no power sources for days on end. I basically wanted a camera that is small but still offered the megazoom feature and good image quality.In the beginning the camera worked flawlessly. After 2 months of ownership and being very careful with it then lens/focusing system failed. I would get an error and the lens would not focus or extend in and out of the camera body. I turned off the camera and removed/replaced the battery and the lens barrel still did not retract.Panasonic replaced the camera since it was under warranty.The replacement worked for only 1 month before it also failed in the exact same manner. Being Irate with the lens failure for a second time on the DMC-TZ10/ZS7 and then on another Panasonic camera the DMC-FH5 I am giving up on Panasonic's smaller camera. For the rest of the field season I had to use my personal Canon G11 which I absolutely love it just does not have the supper zoom feature.I am giving the DMC-TZ10/ZS7 a 3 star rating because of the poor workmanship and quality of the lens barrel. The Leica lens (glass) is fantastic as is the easy use of the camera and it's size. The camera is good for certain occasions but not for taking outside and hiking around the woods and desert or in general the great outdoors for long periods of time.Overall not a bad camera, but there are so many others out there you can do better.","January 14, 2011",
cameras,Great camera - too bad it broke after 4 months,R. Greenlee,R2N4KY1K2UHTVA,3,We got this camera back in March looking for a point and shoot that could take great pictures and also record at least 720P HD video. This camera fit the bill very well and we have been happy with it. That is until we took it on vacation and it broke halfway through the trip. It powers on and looks ok until you try to zoom in/out and try to take a picture at which point it reports a Focus Error.I called Panasonic support and they gave me RMA info to send it back in but the thing I'm most upset with support about is that they will only send me a refurbished unit. Here I have a 4 month old camera in prestine condition and they want to replace it with a refurbished model in questionable condition. Very unhapy with this.Like I said.. good camera but not happy with the support experience when it broke.,"August 15, 2010",
cameras,"Lots To Love, Great Videos, A Few Reservations",Ellen Ripley,RL9ZGTGJBOHMI,3,"I've had this camera just about a week and will write a full review when I know how this camera works a little better. I also bought a Canon SD940is. Although I never owned a Canon it was immediately intuitive without any user's manual. I was shooting and taking videos in 10 minutes. This camera, the ZS7 has lots more features, but it lacks the very cool MY COLORS feature of the latest Powershots. The ZS7 is not as intuitive for me to use because it has lots more manual settings and I was turning things on and off like crazy. If I keep it in iA (Intelligent Auto) I get beautiful pictures unless the light isn't very good. The Image Stabilization is spot on. You can download the manual but it doesn't really help much explaining what certain settings do very well and doesn't give help on how to take better pictures using the many adjustments.But I'm writing this preliminary review to address a couple problems I'm experiencing that may cause me to return this camera unless some of you experts can shed some light on my problems. Hope you know the answers.1. I looked at my camera and noticed that the firmware is version 1.0 I went to the Panasonic website and see that there is a ZS7 upgrade to version 1.1 available to download. However it ways for: DMC-ZS7 (Without DMC-ZS7GK). Now I don't know what that GK stands for, but I'm wondering if it's something I should download. I know that there are problems with non OEM batteries when new firmware versions are downloaded. Wondering what to do here?2. During Playback Mode you can set the Auto Rotate function ON and it should rotate the pics on the screen horizontally or vertically as you display your pictures on the screen.(I'm not using Slideshow) The Canon does this perfectly. This does not appear to work on my ZS7 camera at all. Am I doing something wrong? Is the camera broken?3. I have taken quite a few videos, and in some, but not all, of them I can hear a clicking noise while I am recording and also in the playback. I did a test video last night inside the house and zoomed the heck out of the camera and there were no click at all. I have digital zoom turned off. I recorded in M-JPEG. But some other videos I did a couple days ago have a very audible and annoying clicking noise in them throughout.4. I've played around a lot with the menus and taken a lot of videos and in a matter of a few hours my battery is running down to 2 bars. I took some videos one night then did not use the camera for a couple days and when I went to show someone the pictures the battery was dead almost immediately. However, even though I had done about the same amount of videos the Canon was still chugging away and we took a few more videos, took some pictures and did a slide show of my 120 pics and 5 videos and the battery was still full. WOW! (that's wow in a bad way for the ZS7).Please weigh in camera experts and especially ZS7 owners. Thanks.Panasonic Lumix DMC-ZS7 12.1 MP Digital Camera with 12x Optical Image Stabilized Zoom and 3.0-Inch LCD (Blue)UPDATE 6/30/12: I've owned this camera almost 2 years now and just thought I should report in. This is BEST CAMERA I have ever owned. I take a lot of pictures for e-Bay stuff and with friends and family. I mostly shoot on the auto setting because it creates nearly perfect pictures. Pictures are crisp, clear and properly balanced. You don't even really need any kind of photo editor for this camera except for cropping and adding text. The pictures are that good. Of course, I'm not a professional photographer. Battery life is good although I always carry a spare battery just in case. The only bad thing is the software that comes with it, it's not very good. So I don't use it.","August 2, 2010",
cameras,Not rugged enough for the backcountry,BrianD,R2NPABUJGBO955,3,"I bought this camera primarily for use when motorcycling in the backcountry. From the get-go the lens cover has been susceptible to even small amounts of dust. It would stick closed or partially closed regularly, requiring assistance to open. Not a big deal when blown out with a can of air regularly. It did this even when always kept cased and in a plastic bag when not in use.The camera got wet once when in the pocket of my riding jacket in a rain storm. Not flooded, just damp on the outside, resulting in condensation on/in the lenses. I set it in a bag of rice for 2 weeks...no go. Sent it off to be repaired...$180 IIRC. Worked fine for 3-4 day trips before dying a final time-no image on the display when you try to take a picture. Display itself works fine...must be in the image capture electronics. Tossing it this time and replacing with a waterproof/dustproof unit.Otherwise, it was a great camera...good image quality, geotagging a nice feature and great zoom.

They had me ship it back and sent me another one. What I didn't know was that under warranty, they send back a refurbished camera. That would have been fine but the one I received was banged up and scratched to the point where the model & serial # were barely readable. After the year warranty was up (5 months later), the camera malfunctioned in 5 different ways. I had bought a 5 yr extended warranty when originally purchasing the camera but even the camera repair shop had trouble fixing the camera. In the end, they fixed 4 out of 5 problems and one of the fixed problems has gradually gotten worse - ie. trying to get the camera to focus on closeups have a 65% chance of NOT working. I could send it back for repair again but I will be out the cost of shipping it back again, plus paying the $10 service charge each time it's serviced and I am without a camera for each ""repair time"".","May 3, 2012",
cameras,DMC-ZS7 & DMC-ZS10 Great Picture and Video Poor GPS,"Peter P. Strawn ""Peter""",RVLEX6DUPUFBN,3,"The Panasonic DMC-ZS7 and DMC-ZS10 both take excellent still and video photos. Their picture quality is the best I've experience in a point-n-shoot camera. However, the GPS functionality is quite frankly poor. In testing the accuracy ranged from 15 to 185 yards, significantly worse than the 3-5 yards experienced with the Casio EX-H20G, Sony DSC-HX7V, or Nikon P6000. The buyer needs to ask themselves what is most important, the picture quality or the accuracy of the coordinates. In a perfect world it would be great to have both in a small point-n-shoot camera, but so far I've yet to find that ideal combination. If you value still and video image quality then buy the Panasonic DMC-ZS7 or DMC-ZS10. Both provide excellent picture and video quality. The other options tested so far provided these results: Nikon P6000 - accurate GPS, fairly quick satellite lock after an initial lock-on in the area, good quality pictures, and mediocre video quality at best. Casio EX-H20G - GPS fairly accurate (within 3-5 meters) and also has a feature when used with the Nikon ViewNX2 program that shows the direction the camera was facing when the photo was taken. Still images: - produces photos taken in sunlight with auto WB that have a pronounced yellowish cast (probably resultig from poor auto WB controls) - non-moving images the focus is good and sharp - moving images are frequently out of focus because of the shutter lag in shooting - tends to over-expose photos 0.3-0.7 f/stops (you can set the exposure offset to compensate for this BUT the setting is lost every time you power down - it appears to not save any of the menu system settings when you turn the camera off) Video - zoom function does not work (digital zoom off) after you've started a recording, before pressing start it does work - quality is OK at minimum zoom settng but not as good as the DMC-ZS7 or DMC-ZS10 - using the digital zoom function produced very poor quality video Sony DSC-HX7V Still images: - produces the worst photos of any of the GPS cameras - the white balance is never correct and there is no easy way to correct this in the camera - the sensor has very high contrast and this cannot be adjusted in the camera - the exposure settings choose to grossly overexpose images, even with a manual offset of -1.3 f/stops the pictures still had overexposure issues due to the sensor's high contrast Video: - the videos are OK at the higher resolution settings though the colors are muted - the zoom function works in the video mode - the camera has a very good macro capability","April 11, 2012",
cameras,GPS not worth it,R. Slate,RBANTH940J8ND,3,"I purchased this camera specifically because of its GPS functionality. My cell phone tags photos with the GPS coordinates, so I wanted the same functionality with a better camera. However, the GPS only updates every 5 minutes -- and only if it can find a satellite, which it usually cannot (like in most buildings).The result is that most photos are completely mis-tagged because it uses the last available GPS location for its tagging. My cell phone, amazingly, is orders of magnitude more accurate because it is able to locate a satellite very easily (even in buildings, like your house), and if it can't locate one, it doesn't tag the photo with incorrect information. That makes the coordinates basically worthless. The pictures are just fine, but if you're buying this for the GPS, my advice is not to buy it.","February 12, 2011",
cameras,Digital Camera,Ralph Furlong,RWPNRCXM47OTF,3,"I purchased this camera because it had a wide lens (24mm) and for its size. The intent was to use this camera while riding a tandem and being able to take one handed pictures with it. Most small cameras have too narrow a lens (28 to 30mm) which is fine for close up shots, but not so good for scenery shots.Overall, the camera works just fine. The image stabilization is not as good as my Nikon, but then again, it did not cost as much as my Nikon. The grip on the camera leaves a lot to be desired though. There is not enough of a ridge to safely hold the camera with one hand and to take pictures with.Low level light shots are the worst I have seen short of camera phones and IPOD touch camera. The pictures turn out very grainy. If you are in low light levels, ensure that you are using a flash and/or using a tripod.My biggest complaint has to do with Panasonic Service (or lack of service) when there is an issue. When the camera arrived, we took the camera and everything out of the package and it all looked just fine. We started using the camera on a trip almost immediately. When we got home two weeks later, we went to install the software so that we could download the pictures from the camera. That is where the trouble started. The software disk had a hidden flaw on it. From the package, it looked just fine. But remove the disk and look at the shinny surface where the data is recorded and you see a very large crack! Well, we could either ship the entire thing back to Amazon since we were within 30 days or contact Panasonic. Since we were keeping the camera, we thought the best thing to do was contact Panasonic. That was a BIG mistake!! Panasonic took 2 weeks, several e-mails and phone calls to decide it was not there problem since it was now outside of the 30 day warranty from the ship date of the camera! I reminded them that the first contact with their company was within the 30 days and they finally agreed to ship a replacement. Well, many weeks later, still NO software!!!!!!!!I am currently using my Nikon software to take pictures from the camera, but I have no manual since that is on the disk and there is NO option to download a manual from the Panasonic website!! I have been told that if I want a manual, I have to purchase the software!!!Overall, I would NOT recommend this company to anyone based upon their service response. I would presume that the rest of their warranty on their camera is not worth much either. This leaves me with the feeling that this is a throw away camera, and a very expensive one for that type of camera!If you buy this camera, CHECK the condition of the software disk immediately!! If it is damaged, return the camera for a new one!! Do NOT trust Panasonic to replace the disk!!!!!","February 27, 2011",

This is my first panasonic cam and i own a Sony DSC-H1. The camera was shipped ontime and reached as expected.Was very impressed with the first look. I used mostly the IAuto mode and in well lit conditions pics were awesome, but when i started to take pics at places that had little less lighting like cloudy out door and little shadowy places, it was difficult. The IAuto mode started selecting scene's that made pics looks less impressive. everyshot at the same subject it chose a different scene and gave different results.This is where it got little frustrating as i had to take several shots to get the ideal result. Also the color's were little saturated..making it look little unnatural. I did take the same pics with my sony and panasonic to compare the results and definitely sony had a notch above the results of panasonic.I think to get the best out of the cam you had to tweak the settings..

I am thoroughly disappointed with the quality of the photos. It does an okay job in daylight settings but the pictures are quite dull. Especially in low light settings the photos are horrible and grainy, comparable to performance of camera attached to my cell phone. The features of the camera such as GPS, 12x optical zoom, large LCD screen, numerous auto intelligence settings and many manual settings (aperture/shutter priority) are alluring but they do not make up for the lack of quality in the photos... I have to say I miss my old Canon! I am stuck with it since I am now traveling abroad. I took over 1000 photos on this trip and none of them compare to the photos I took with my old SD800.

I have used it in low light situations (coffee house/comedy club) and the photos are atrocious, and there was camera shake (which I rarely ever got on my Canon). Most of the photos were useless because of blur or poor lighting. I was using the zoom feature. I also had my Lumix FX75 on me and it's photos were just fine. No blur and lighting adjusted very well. That just seems wrong. I'll keep the FX75 (which uses a normal USB cable) and I'll be returning this one even though I love the feel and appearance; that is not what I bought it for.CONS: having to switch between PLAY and SHOOT, that is just dumb in this day and age.","September 26, 2010",

The camera was never dropped nor exposed to unusually high dust or dirt levels but still the dots are there.For a $300+ camera and the used to be good reputation of Panasonic I would have expected a better response in support of their product. Sadly, it is considered a disposable product to them as is their reputation for a quality camera.I will not buy another Panasonic product given their obvious lack of pride or support for the products they sell. Too bad because I really liked the camera before the black dots ruined every single photo - its a crap shoot - if you're lucky you either won't have any issues with the seal or you will have it when you take the camera out of the box - not after actually using it.","June 16, 2013",

The bad news is the software is worst user designed interface I have used. Flip is like 1000 times better.a. It does not give you the option to delete pictures and videos after download to PC. So you end up with duplicates everytime and my disc space if now full. I have no time to go look at what I uploaded previous vs this time as I have a 16Gb memory disc. Or at least offer ""these 25 videos have been previously uploaded, do you still want to upload?""b. The MTS is virtually useless, you have to manually convert them to MPEG2 so other sites like Picasa and Facebook can view them. In doing so, you totally lose the MTS Hidef. So now my disc usage is twice because I have to store MTS and MPEGc. When you create a folder say 2010-Apr-Baby, it automatically creates another subfolder 100419 and put it there. I want to put it in the top folder and it won't let me do that.d. There is no easy upload to Picasa, Flikr and Facebook. You cannot share the onto appletv or boxee on TV.Lousy software, you gotta to be kidding us in this day and age.","May 2, 2010",
cameras,"You dont have to out run the tiger, you just have to...","Indian ""Indian""",R3SIHFGAXZK1VZ,3,"Imagine a tiger is chasing you and another person, to survive you dont have to out run the tiger, you just have to out run the other person; I think that is what ZS7 does to its competition in this segment. I own a Casio 6MP EXilm which I was planning on upgrading, earlier I bought Nikon S6000 a few months back and returned it as its video quality in bright incandescent light was Horrendous. I then researched the Travel zoom category in detail. SX210 has a design flaw with flash popping up where you place your finger and no GPS, Casio FH100 although doesn't have GPS, thought was a tough competitor but you cant optically zoom in video (huge drawback) doesnt make sense to have long zoom when cant use it in video. didn't want to go back to Nikon s8100 with its video issues, but I am very impressed with its still picture quality and color reproduction (nothing compares to that). Samsung HZ35W the closest to ZS7 interms of features but I dont think its video quality is not as good as ZS7's in bright light. Then we have Sony HX5 probably has better lense than ZS7, especially regarding the purple streak issue that ZS7 has when pointed at bright light sources, but the image quality is not as sharp. I bought ZS7 for 199 and had it for few days now.Good : Great sharp pictures in bright light and also white light (florescent/tube) it automatically used ISO160. I was able to get nice depth of field in this point and shoot.Bad : but when it comes to incandescent (yellow) light it has some issues automatically uses atleast ISO400 gets little grainy. These issues are exaggerated in Video mode (not sure what happens with the video mode same issue with Nikon and Panasonic the screen automatically becomes a tad darker than it was in picture mode!!. Setting the AWB for incandescent light(auto white balance helped a little but does not alleviate the problem completely).Ugly : The s/w that came with it is horrendous, I still have to figure out how to download AVCHD lite videos to my computer with out the silly s/w (which I am planning on uninstalling) that was provided and also in which s/w I can play that, The manual is not a selling point either.The compromise : I had a previous bad experience with Panasonic with another electronic product I own, I seriously did not want to buy this brand. but as I mentioned earlier ZS7 did out run the others in the things I was looking for. I will experiment with it for few more days and then decide if I want to return.. but then what else is in the market that could beat this??????. Good Luck.Update on 05/01/2011, I have had this camera for a while, low light condition best to use IA auto mode to get best results bot in video and picture mode. I am down grading my rating to a 3 from 4 coz' of big missing feature. Automatic time-stamp on the picutre is missing. I couldn't believe that it was not there!!. WOW come on Panasonic you have good camera here is there there a firmware/software we can download to have this without lowering the picture quality to 3 mega pix. Please Do something.

cameras,"Great photos/video, but video boot up is too slow!",Brent Winters,R2P009ZXR3GAA8,3,"I love the mega zoom on this camera and wide angle lens. The HD video quality is fantastic even when displayed on my 110"" home theater screen. However, the biggest drawback that may lead me to buy a new camera soon is that it takes way too long to boot up to the video mode. I like to take a combination of video and camera shots during a great scene with my family. Unlike my past camera, this one takes 10 seconds to boot up and activate video recording. It then takes another 4 seconds or so to save the video and take a photo, then more time to switch back to video. I can't tell you how many moments I've missed because the camera was too slow. I also miss my previous compact camera that fit into my pants pocket much more easily. I will probably buy a new camera this year if I can find one with similar features that addresses these two key issues.","January 25, 2011",
cameras,Thought it would be better,Chas52,R1H2HYJNYU13MY,3,"I purchased this camera last week after considerable research of many megazoom cameras. I will be short and to the point. The camera is amazing in what it can do well. The picture quality is very good with ideal lighting, the same can be said of the video. However, and it is a big however. The camera is horrible in low light situations. Using the shutter speed over 400 and in many cases 400 itself renders the picture useless. I may be doing something wrong, although I doubt it, but when I attempt to use any speed over 400 the pictures come out with a extreme amount of ""noise"", many times with rainbow, streaky colors, rendering the picture un-viewable. I have a small Canon IXY camera that runs circles around this camera in low light situations. I will continue to experiment with different settings in low light situations, but I am seriously considering returning this camera due to its disappointingly low light results.","January 9, 2011",

I am very limited in what I can use the camera for, or what I can do with the camera, as the manual's English just plain stinks. I can't stitch a panorama with the manual's instructions! For the price, I think better use could have been made of the good old english language.I have some other criticisms, but not sure they are valid, since there are so many things on the camera I don't understand.Perhaps need a class in Panasonic-talk.

cameras,Stuck with a refurbished,RGA,R2ZFA1TX2TVWZ5,3,"I got this Lumix because of the features and favorable reviews. I noticed however, that the photos were incosistent, mostly it's yellowish especially in low light. When I used it the first time, I noticed a small dark speck on the right lower quadrant of the screen. It also zoomed when I zoom. I figured it must be a dust in the imaging system so I emailed Panasonic and was instructed to mail it to Texas. When I got it back, I was very disappointed that it was replaced with a refurbished unit. This doesn't seem fair. I paid full price for a brand new item in a box, and I got back the camera and accessories in a plastic bag. It is still under warranty, so at the very least it should have been replaced if not repaired and returned in the box I bought it with. Or they should give me a refund to make up for the price difference had I purchased a refurbished unit. This may well be my last Panasonic.","December 20, 2010",
cameras,Overrated and Inconsistent Especially For The Price,High Speed Writer,R33MA7ZN4V5L8O,3,"I have had my Panasonic for a little over a year. I am a freelance writer who also does photography to supplement some of my writing work. While I consider myself a writer more than a photographer over the years my photos have appeared in many articles and books including cover shots. I only point this out to show that I am not a rank amateur point and shooter or someone who cannot deal with manual controls or settings adjustments. I own a couple of Canon DSLRs and also a Canon S3 that I use when I want to travel light. The S3 is getting abit outdated and I hate the fact it uses AA batteries rather than its own rechargeable unit. Carrying a bundle of AAs and/or a charger for them is a nuisance with all the travel I do. I wanted a smaller camera with a rechargeable battery that could take quality photos as well as video. Having video is a plus for some of my website clients. Long story short, after studying the market and the reviews I chose the Lumix ZS7 for the Leica lens, variety of shooting modes and video quality. The long zoom was also a plus. I must say the video is excellent, but the quality of still photos is very inconsistent. I have tried a variety of settings and modes, but none can guarantee a high quality shot. The Intelligent Auto is anything but. I abandoned using it completely. Don't get me wrong, when it works, some of the photos are high quality, but most of the time, I'd rate them as average. Shooting indoors at auto shows, quality is average at best. Forget trying to focus in on a speaker during a presentation/demonstration. Many times photos are blurry because the camera is slow in writing to the memory card. And yes, I do use a high-speed pro quality memory card. My old 5megapixel Coolpix point and shot was way better. Bottom line, this camera is overrated and overpriced in my experience. It's too bad because it is of high quality build and a nice size, altho a bit hefty. I don't usually write product reviews, but felt I needed to in this case to save someone else from perhaps stretching their budget thinking they were getting a superior product and finding out it's average at best.","November 17, 2011",
cameras,Horrible indoor pictures - awesome everything else,"Alexandre Nassif ""A. Nassif""",R2RQCVJUJTX767,3,"I bought this camera to go to a trip in South America after a long search for a decent point-and-shoot (I own a Nikon D40X which is awesome but too big and does not take videos, and also an old 2005 model Canon which is starting to give up).I wanted something small, with stereo sound HD video recording and good pictures - nothing else. This Panasonic seemed to be all I wished for - and more. I was very happy to buy it and resolve my endless search (I had been looking for this for almost 1 year).The good pros of my experience:- The videos are incredible for a compact camera. I'd say they rival HD camcorders and are way better than I expected.- The GPS tagging works flawlessly and is also better and much more than I anticipated.- The outdoor pictures are just mind blowing awesome, bright and beautiful.- The wide angle is also superb.- The superzoom works great even though the AF is slow - but completely acceptable to me.- It uses a Leica lens and has the same guts as the V-LUX 20.Now the only con, but a deabreaker:- The indoor pictures are horrible. And I don't mean that by taking the price of the camera into consideration; I bought my sister a $70 Kodak that takes pictures a zillion times better that the Panasonic under the same light conditions (we were taking pictures at the same party, of the same subjects).I don't know what's wrong with Panasonic/Leica to release such a product in the market. How can Leica put its reputation in the line with this????Since I wanted the camera to take pictures mainly in parties/dark conditions of people (over 60% of my pictures are of people in dark conditions), in the end I returned the camera and unfortunately am resuming my search for a good point-and-shoot. I will try the Canon S95 now... and really hope to end my search there...","March 7, 2011",
cameras,"Good camera, but not the right one for me",A. Scoggins,R141SIPSSZZI0S,3,"I spent a great deal of time researching cameras and I thought this might be a good one for me. I really wanted something with more of a zoom than my old camera. I did not expect this camera to do well indoors or in low light, but I didn't realize how poorly it would perform in these situations. My 5 year old 4 megapixel Canon A520 produces better indoor photos than the Panasonic ZS7. I am not a photographic genius, however I do have a basic understanding of aperture, shutter speed and ISO. I am not opposed to playing with manual settings, but sometimes I just want to grab the camera and shoot in auto or P mode. I tried a variety of settings with the ZS7...I must've taken 500 pictures during the past week, just trying to figure out how to get it to produce an acceptable image indoors...a few of those 500 pictures looked pretty good, but it took way too much work to achieve that. I used it outside on a cloudy day, and those images were not great. I also used it outside on a sunny day, and those pictures turned out beautifully. If you're looking for a camera to be used strictly outdoors, then I think this camera is very good. Even with the zoom fully extended, the sunny outdoor pictures were really nice. However, I need a camera that does well in a variety of settings. The main subject of my photos is my family...kids, husband, dog, etc. This camera did not work well for me in that capacity. I tend to take most of my pictures outside, but do a fair amount indoors as well. I don't want to carry multiple cameras with me. I want one camera that is versatile. I do not expect DSLR quality photos, but I do want photos that are consistently adequate and sometimes exceptional, no matter what the setting. I am still searching for a camera that meets my needs. I'll stick with my A520 until I find something suitable (or until it dies on me!). I'm looking into the Canon S95 or Panasonic LX5 next...not much zoom, but I'll give that up for better image quality and versatility.Bottom line is, if zoom is truly important to you and you don't need something that easily produces decent indoor shots, you will probably be extremely happy with this camera. If I could afford to keep this one AND buy something else that is more versatile, I would do it.","January 31, 2011",

We wanted a camera slightly smaller in size, and with good image stabilization. The new Lumix, the DMC-ZS7, is a good looking camera, with nice weight and easy operation. In the automated mode, the stabilization did not work or if it did it had no perceptible effect. Worse yet, the camera saw the color red as too orange. It sometimes saw the color green as white. We had to return the camera. The DMC-ZS7 is certainly nicely-designed, but after being disappointed with this particular camera I read other reviews and came across some which also complained of poor color imaging. I didn't see any other comments about the poor stabilization that we encountered. Did we just get a ""lemon"" or does this model have design defects? I don't know.

Now that I have them both here together I have had the opportunity to do some head to head, direct comparison shots. I just do not see the results improved when looking at the Lumix photos. Actually, nearly all the ZS7 shots had to be improved with editing software while many of the Canon shots were great right from the camera, no touch up required. This is same subjects, same lighting same time. I also find the video on the Canon to be much better quality. I want to love the Lumix. The results are just not there. I have not given up. I now have on my wish list a Lumix LX5. Reviews I have read compare it to a Canon G12 or Nikon P7000. I want to give the Lumix cameras one more chance to ""wow"" me. This model just did not do so.

The video feature has also been extremely handy, although I did have to dig around to figure out how to save it in a format that was readable on my laptop.My mixed emotions stem mainly from the color of the images. In nearly all my indoor photos where a flash is required, the image looks very red or orange. I have since read that I may just have a faulty camera, which is unfortunate.

It takes what appear to be great scene photos, but I was in it for pictures of my family on vacation, etc.. but people just don't look great unless you are about 1 foot from them and outside. I was excited about the HD video mode combined all in one. I took videos on vacation and can not get them off of the camera. You can only get them off if you use their 1 program supplied but the program does not work with all computers. It does not work on mine, windows XP. Also trouble with Windows 7 I have read. After calling panasonic they did not seem too concerned that this program does not work on alot of computers. So there these videos are, on the camera and can't get them off. I want to return it but since I purchased it for vacation the 30 days has passed by about a week. Little did I know I would run into these troubles after getting back. Not to mention the extra batteries and high memory card I bought for it can not be returned now either. So now it will just become a waste of money camera to use at the beach outside. You can take a non HD video and download it without the program but it looks terrible. I own a Nikon D300 which I love and read that this camera was the closest point and shoot to an SLR, I would hate to see what the others are like.

Left it for about 3 weeks taking the odd photograph before the battery conked out, so I reckon the GPS doesn't affect battery life significantly.Update 01/07/2013GPS is very slow to recognise change of location. I travelled by air from Abu Dhabi in the U.A.E. to Amman in Jordan and it was at least an hour before the camera recognised that my location had changed.Now, I admit I keep my camera, with no case, in my pocket when travelling. That said, blotches are now appearing on images thanks to the dust and other particles that have found their way into the lens assembly. There is no way to remove this contamination. I've carried other cameras in my pocket for years without any problems due to dust particles getting into the lens assembly.Update 01/21/2013 There is still loads of dust in the lens assembly but it turns out it's dust on the sensor that was causing the blotches on my photographs.

cameras,A very mixed bag,"W. Webb ""WillNYC31""",R2H9AMRTZNKK4L,3,"I bought this for the GPS. As there are very few point and shoot GPS cameras, I really only had three to consider seriously. I chose this one because the other two on my short list produced images that looked heavily processed straight out of the camera. The GPS is very good and accurate, once it takes its very sweet time to locate where it is. A recent trip to Lisbon, it took the camera nearly 36 hours and a heavy drain on the battery to determine that it was, in fact, in Lisbon. But once it figured it out, the GPS worked perfectly. This is also a problem when traveling shorter distances as well. Think you can drive to a town two hours away and the camera can just be picked up and the GPS will have determined location? Not always. So, since I was purchasing this camera primarily as a GPS camera, I am a little underwhelmed by its capabilities. If you don't want a GPS, you can get far better picture quality on a Cannon point and shoot for about half the price so I wouldn't bother with this camera if you don't want the GPS. Image quality is a much bigger problem here than any of my other point and shoots, even those several years old. The long range zoom is a great marketing device but picture quality goes down significantly when zooming even half of this camera's range. Low light photos are worse than on my $89 Cannon. HD Video? Essentially another marketing ploy. The video is fine for email and social network sharing but falls very short of being anything you'd be proud to show on a TV screen of 30 inches or more. Video on the iPhone 4 is better. So, I gave this three stars just because, to my knowledge, this is the best point and shoot camera with a GPS. But it needs great improvements.","May 4, 2011",

This camera is great in good light.It is not good in low light situations in fact its downright abysmal2. There is a hiss sound every time you shoot a video in all modes.This is very annoying and from posts elsewhere this is a common problem with this camera.3. There are issues with capturing and editing the AVCHD Lite HD (except in Final cut)Luckily you can record HD in .mov format in stereo and edit in iMovie. You cannot do this in AVCHDIts not full HD its only 720.Its ashamed this little camera has so much potential but I returned it for a refund.I had an earlier model and it did not suffer from these issues.I will wait for there Canon G12 when it ever comes out - I have a G10 - Now thats a camera but sadly no HD yetI would of loved to give this camera a 5 star but .......

cameras,The Panasonic/Lumix camera....,Nicholas in Seattle,R32MSLJFIYOUQH,3,"UPDATE 1-23-2011:I am here to update my review after having spent considerable time using and pushing the limits of my new Camera here.1) Apparently I am too used to full length feature film works, because what I have learnt in asking, is that the new camera's of today, are made specifically ""for tasks"". The camera I bought is for residential, non professional use. However it does take professional quality pictures, as well video's. Of the 15 minutes short take variety. Honestly I should have known better than to think moreso. I do apologize for missing that point. The battery in the camera, works just fine for the SHORT LENGTH VIDEO it does take... and without any troubles. KUDO'S!2) I am still not happy that I cannot hook up to AC Power with it. The battery is it. Some have said buy a second battery, well that's a gimmie now. I will indeed.3) Further study, this camera zoom in STILL ""IN MY OPINION"" not all its cracked up to be, in fact, the Kodak V seriees Zoom beats the hell out of any I have seen thus far. Mind you what I said "" of any I have seen"". And I have not seen ALL camera zoom ever made. But of the many I have seen, Snieder Lenses RULE in zoom and clarity.3) The camera does in fact take Feature Film Quality photo's as well video. And again I state the slower moving controllable zoom makes keeping the images in focus from A to Z much better. I would love to see them work on this factor some more.I like the Camera, but I do not LOVE the camera. The V-610 Kodak far outweighs any digital compact I have seen or used since. I miss that camera big time. But this one is absolutely my 2nd choice.Always Nicholas in SeattleOkay, well I am a Filmmaker-Director-Producer- avid photographer throughout my lifetime thus far... 50 years alive and counting...I've been taking pictures since I was 7 years of age. Reported to be one of thee greatest natural photographers in history. Not my personal opinion, but rather thee opinion of professionals in the related field.In using the camera mentioned herein I have found a few things... see them as you like, but these are ""my personal experiences"" thus far...I purchased this camera brand New through Amazon weeks ago. It is now December 23rd 2010 SO early December it was purchased....#1) The camera is not even remotely ""user friendly"". I am constantly referring to the manuals to try and figure out ""how to"" do things with it.#2 ) My greatest PEEVE or disappointment with this camera are two things, 1, it does not seem to have an AC POWER SUPPLY, and one most certainly DID NOT COME WITH the camera in the box. I assume I will have to pay YET MORE for that feature, IF that feature even exists with this camera ??? I will have to RESEARCH MORE IN THE MANUAL to learn this ... and 2, when I plug my camera into my computer to view or download pictures or video's... the computer does not charge the camera at the same time LIKE OTHER FAR LESS EXPENSIVE CAMERAS DO. ( GEEZE with ALL I paid for this ONE WOULD THINK I would at least have something the CHEAPEST CAMERS OUT THERE HAVE??? HELLOOOOOO !!!)#3) When I was trying to get my Camera ""interior memory items"" into my computer, it was almost impossible to find out HOW TO TRANSFER from internal memory to disc or hard drive.#4) When I take pictures, there are so many settings on the dial to choose from, and NONE OF THEM ARE CLEARLY MARKED AS ""TYPICAL OR NORMAL"" settings ( again LIKE MOST CAMERAS HAVE ). So I cannot tell what the NORMAL EVERYDAY picture taking mode IS ?????#5) When I take a picture, they are rarely SHARP. And that PROBABLY stems from my lack of KNOWLEDGE regarding WHICH PICTURE TAKING MODE I am SUPPOSE to be in. ???#6) The BRAGGED ABOUT 16X ZOOM feature.... is NOT all it is bragged up to be. I had a Kodak V610 compact digital, which I must say had THEE GREATEST ZOOM and LENSE CLARITY of ANY camera I have seen since. UNFORTUNATELY FOR ME... I dropped it into SALT WATER on accident, and that split second of submerging cost me the life of that amazing camera. While I was bragging it up, a friend told me that Panasonic made a better lens and zoom. So that is why I bought the DMC-ZS7, but I can tell you pointedly, the lens IS NOT AS GOOD AS the Kodak V610 by any stretch of ones imagination. Nor is the ZOOM even REMOTELY CLOSE to the one in my old V610. Ohh well, learn from our mistakes I guess...Video wise however....The video mode of this camera is awesome ONCE YOU CAN FIGURE OUT HOW TO USE IT, *Ugh* I LOVE the clarity of the video, and I especially LOVE the ability you have to CONTROL THE ZOOM IN AND OUT """"""SPEED"""". Which is CRITICAL to GOOD VIDEO FOOTAGE. Focus at the slowest controllable speed is outstanding.I give HUGE KUDO's for that ability.I would suggest that Panasonic/Lumix take focus on making the SPEED OF ZOOM even MORE EASILY controllable, which will enable the shooter to capture consistent STELLAR videography, or video production.Thats all for now. Possibly more later as I dig deeper into the camera's abilities, in attempts to Master this device.Always Nicholas in Seattle","December 23, 2010",
cameras,"Could be really good, BUT...","Soured Customer ""Soured Customer""",R2JVCW2LOOXAU1,3,"...the quality is completely inconsistent. I have now purchased four, count them: 1, 2, 3, 4 of these cameras.The first one was returned because every image had a greenish yellow tint that was unnatural and could not be eliminated through white balance adjustment. So, I returned it and ordered camera number two. This one seemed to take great photos all around. However, the glass on the the lcd, within a couple of days, was loose and wobbled around. Strike two. Well, let's call it a foul tip. RMA. I ordered camera number three. This time, I ordered it in white instead of black, hoping maybe they come from different production facilities and may have different revisions of the build components or better quality control. Nope. Camera number three had exactly the same issue as number one - greenish yellow tinted photos. Returned. I just got camera number four. The pictures are outstanding, BUT it has the same issue as camera number two with the loose glass on the back. What gives? Seriously. This is ridiculous.You'd think I'd just order another brand altogether. However, I've already tried the Canon S95, and this Panasonic blows it away. It's much much faster (what's the point of having a camera if you miss the shot because the camera doesn't react in time), the low light ability is far superior, the macro is wonderful, it can zoom while recording video, and the battery life is excellent. It has the potential to be a great camera, if only it was built better. I have issues spending $400 on a point and shoot in the first place, more or less one that is falling apart right out of the box. Arggghhh!!!","December 29, 2010",
cameras,It's OK but not amazing,Marshall,R7VDHURXQHLHW,3,"Before purchasing this camera I considered the S95 (canon) and the G12 as they were then the only available point and shoots with wide lenses and full manual control. I read a lot of reviews and tested the three cameras at a store and finally decided to get the LX5 because of superior handling over the s95 and compact size compared the G12. In general am happy with the camera, however there are a number of drawbacks that make it less than perfect for my typical usage patterns. Below I expand with some thoughts that drove my decision making process and the reasons behind my 3 stars rating.1) Compact: I wanted something I could carry in a pocket during long walking tours or long hikes when a DSLR would be too bulky and heavy, or conspicuous. At the same time something not too small because I find small cameras to be uncomfortable and often awkward to handle. The G12 dropped out of the race at this stage as it is too large. The S95, on the other hand was too small. In this regard the Lumix LX5 was perfect being small enough but still comfortable to use... unless you plan to use filters. In which case you need the relatively large adapter that turns this camera into the size of a small 4/3 system without the advantages.2) Manual control: I wanted full manual control and in this regard the camera is also great (as the S95 and G12). Everything is easy to control with little or no interaction with the menus. Aperture and shutter speed are right there at your fingertips and other functions such as white balance, flash control, and exposure compensation can be accessed from quick menu really easy. You can customize one of the buttons to access a function directly, which in my case I use for exposure bracketing. As with all point and shoot cameras, manual focus is a pain to use but the autofocus has been reliable for me. In general, I am very happy with the controls and my only complain is the scroll wheel is a little bit to stiff for my taste.3) Versatility: I like the ability to use filters on a point and shoot every now and then and I am pleased I can do that with this camera. The adapter tube is long to allow for the lens to fully extend, so you loose some compactness factor. Attaching the tube is not hard but I found is not something I want to do on the spot because it takes a few tries to align the threads of the adapter tube to the camera to screw it into position. More than once it took me a few minutes to get the threads true. With this said, the tube takes standard filters and you don't need to buy the -expensive- panasonic ones.4) Wide angle and low light: This was a key selling point because I missed the ability of shooting wide angle photos as my previous PS had a 38mm equivalent focal length at the wide end. I also wanted the ability of shooting in low light conditions without flash or without a tripod. In this end the results are a mixed bag and the 3 stars rating comes mainly from this section. The 24mm equivalent lens is great... however, it introduces a lot of distortion and after the initial enthusiasm I find myself falling back to shooting wide at 28mm or so. Now, there are two prices to pay for the 24mm wide lens which am not too happy with, especially compared with the 28mm of the S95. First is the reduced zoom reach: both the S95 and LX5 have a 3.8x range, but the S95 starts 28mm and goes to 105mm whereas the LX5 starts at 24 and ends at 90mm. The difference is actually noticeable and now that I don't use 24mm that much, it is annoying. The other problem is that this lens has 2.0 aperture at 24mm, but it goes up quickly as you zoom in. The S95 has 2.0 at 28mm, which again, now that I don't use 24 that much makes this camera less than ideal for me. In retrospect, I think I probably would have been better served by the S95 lens, although the ergonomics of S95 (too small) was a key factor why I did not purchase it.5) As other reviewers pointed out, the jpegs out of the camera are not pleasant. Colors are dull and noise reduction is not to my taste. I've been shooting in ""dynamic"" mode, which produces more vibrant colors but still not happy with the jpeg quality. The solution is to shoot raw and do some post-processing but this is not what I bought this camera for... When I do casual shooting I rarely have to time/interest to go and do some serious post-processing.6) The low light ability of the camera is good, but anything above ISO 400 is unusable (really bad)... and 400 is pushing it, since you have to shoot raw and then do judicious noise reduction according to your needs and shooting conditions. On the other hand, I can do hand-held shooting in moderately low light situations where I would not even try with other point and shoots.7) This camera is not for close up photography and the limited zoom makes it pretty useless for macro. Minimum focusing distance is less than a couple of cm at 24mm but it goes up very quickly as you increase the focal length. At 24mm there is a lot of distortion (can be corrected with photoshop) which makes the camera even less suitable for this kind of photography.8) Noise: I don't know if it is my copy, but especially in JPEG mode, dark areas show a lot of noise even at low iso when looking at pixel level. I do use serious cropping every now and then and this has become a problem. Related to this, the resolution at pretty much every focal length is not all that good, even compared with lesser point and shoot cameras. Again, I don't know if this is a problem with my particular camera, but when looked at high magnification, edges are way to soft (even in raw). I am not comparing to a DSLR... even an old canon sx100 is sharper (apples to apples, the canon has no raw mode so I don't know what goes into the jpeg processing there).So...Overall this is good point and shoot camera with full manual control, a wide lens (perhaps to wide!) that is very fast at its widest. I have not tried the movie modes or the intelligent auto modes too much, but the in the few instances when used them the results were good. The camera is comfortable to handle (more than the S95 in my opinion) and the controls are intuitive. The ability to shoot at moderately low light or handheld in a wider range of situations afforded by the 2.0 lens is great and I love it. The image quality is not what I expected thought and that bothers me. I must add however, that at standard magnifications this is not a problem but becomes apparent as you look closely. Most problematic is the unattractive, washed out jpegs produced in the standard mode, which do not become much better in ""dynamic"" mode. Shooting raw and some postprocessing takes care of that, but requires work on your part.Do I recommend the camera? I think this is still the camera that best suits my needs (full manual control in a compact body with low light abilities). I like the low light abilities and the wide angle but the IQ still has me scratching my head. I have not tried the Olympus XZ-1, but I would pick this camera again were the s95 and G12 the other contenders.","April 8, 2011",
cameras,Use S95 more than LX5,T. Vo,RHJZZU1WXIRNQ,3,"I have both the S95 and LX5. Wanted a small, high quality camera to take everywhere with me. I end up taking the S95 90% of the time because the jpeg colors look much better, it is smaller and I don't have to worry about the lens cap. The skin colors on my Asian kids just don't seem right with the LX5 but looks great with S95. The S95 and my old Olympus C-7070 have the best straight out of camera jpeg colors. I love the video and the bright lens on the LX5 though. If there was a compact that combined the best of both cameras, that would be a dream come true!","March 26, 2011",
cameras,"Great for most shots, but...",NormaLee,R2LMODNTAGNWMI,3,"I loved the Panasonic Lumix DMC-LX5 when I first started taking pictures with it. I used the ""auto"" setting to compare it to my old Canon point-and-shoot and it was fantastic. The ""auto"" setting switched from landscapes to closeups of flowers and everything in between with ease, and all the photos were sharp and the colors were clear and bright. I even shot into the sun on one photo just to see what would happen, and the exposure was perfect. But then I took it with me on an evening with friends and the photos I took of people in indoor lighting of various kinds were not good. Whether I used available light or the flash, the photos were either under or overexposed. I returned the camera even though I hated to, because I loved its size and ease of use. Too expensive, though, for a camera that isn't great for indoor shots.","December 10, 2012",
cameras,"Great pictures, cheaply made camera",Davy13,R3L1OCDN9FILGY,3,"I won't take up space repeating all of the high praise for the camera's functionality and image quality. All of that is true. This camera takes lovely pictures, especially once you get the white balance settings correct.It's unfortunate that the great lens and sensor are built into a cheaply constructed camera body. Within a month or so of owning it, the zoom toggle switch on mine started getting stuck and now is difficult to use. I take good care of my equipment and haven't gotten dirt or liquid on it.Right out of the box it feels a bit chintzy in build quality.This is my third Lumix camera and all of them have taken great pictures but unfortunately are not built to last.I'd be surprised if it lasts much more than a year.Other improvement suggestions, besides making it sturdier, would be to fix the lens cap to it. It's annoying that it's just loose and easy to lose. The settings dial turns much too easily. Would be nice if that were much stiffer.","October 13, 2011",

Kimball,R23U9A0VDH5GP0,3,"This is a really nice compact camera, I love the new grip, and the option of an electronic viewfinder is great, but the new thumbwheel on the back ruined it for me. I much preferred the mini joystick of the LX3. I found that the thumbwheel required too much pressure to move and felt very awkward. Maybe I did not give it enough time, but returned it and got a G1 for less money and am happy with it.

cameras,Panasonic Lumix DMC-LX5,TL,R1EBTAIBVLVAUM,3,"I was looking for a better P&S; camera (for food photography) to replace my Panasonic Lumix DMC-ZR1 with the consideration of portability, a better image quality, and with a manual control. After reading the reviews and tech specifications, I settled on the Panasonic Lumix DMC-LX5 for its fast lens and low light photography capability. After trying it out for a month and mainly taking food photos in-door, I just don't think its image quality is as good as that from the DMC-ZR1. I couldn't get as sharp an image as I could with DMC-ZR1. However, its resolution at higher ISO does do much better and doesn't deteriorate as much as in DMC-ZR1.","January 29, 2012",

It's just fine.I am a professional photographer and photo professor. I primarily use a large format film camera and a 5D Mark II. I wanted something small and of high quality to take snapshots of my baby, so I researched and bought the LX5. I wasn't expecting the quality of the other cameras that I use, I just wanted something where I could control the settings. This camera is a disappointment. In the same situations as friends who have a Canon G12, their pictures are sharper, the light looks better, the color is better & the camera is faster. I'll make the same picture with each and the Canon just always looks better. I find myself preferring to use my iPhone instead of pulling out the Lumix.I am not enlarging any of these bigger than 8x10, so I can't speak to larger sizes. I know the iPhone wouldn't hold up larger, I am not saying it's a better camera.I give the LX5 3 stars, a C+.","December 25, 2011",
cameras,Aaargh!! Those yellow blobs again. :(,"S. Krishna ""Sam""",R1Q0QVKCJH5HAO,3,"I've had the camera for a week now and its going back. Other than this, I own a Sony DSC-HX9V and a Sony SLT-A55 DSLR. The LX-5 takes excellent pictures in bright light. The pictures are very sharp! However, I got this camera strictly for its 'low light capability'. Unfortunately, it brought back memories of my Panasonic FZ100...the bad memories.Even in a brightly lit mall, I could see the all-too-familiar yellow blobs in the shadows. Those yellow blobs are very hard to get rid of. I know all too well with the pictures of the FZ100 which I owned for almost 2 years. I've spent hours with photoshop to get them out and I'll end up with soft pictures which look ok only when resized much smaller. The FZ100 ruined most of the indoor faily pictures when we went on a cruise.On the plus side, the LX5 has super fast focusing speed and start-up times. Compared to the HX9V, its super fast in start-up and changing menus. The hx9v also focuses very quickly and locks on. This camera, even with the 3 stabilization modes (Auto, mode1 and mode2), the pictures can get shaky. However, I found the flash recharging between shots almost the same in both the cameras. but with a f/2.0 who needs flash right? But, the LCD display is misleading. I would focus the camera on a dark bedroom and it would actually look brighter on the LCD (of which BTW, I cannot reduce brightness). I snap the picture and it looks bright and clean. But when I look up the picture on the computer, the picture is darker than it showed up on the LCD!And people are complaining about losing the cap, I think they are failing to notice the tiny black thread that's included in a white bag stuck behind the cables bag. Nowadays cameras like the HX9V are pocketable with a 20x lens and a camera with a 3x lens cannot have an inbuilt shutter?This will probably be my last panasonic camera. I'm done with those yellow blobs. Yeah, the hx9v might not produce sharp pictures indoors, but at least, I don't have tons of yellow blobs staring me in the face. I can apply some sharpening, brightness and noise reduction, I'll have a usable picture. And oh, the hx9v produces excellent sharp pictures in bright light. I mean which camera nowadays doesn't? And with the HX9V's hand-held twilight mode where it takes a bunch of snaps and gets you a sharp image, there is no need to work with yellow blobs just for sharp noisy pictures.","December 24, 2012",
cameras,Lens cap drives me crazy,Dot,R3QCU86MOMOG5P,3,"As others have noted, the cheapie lens cap on this camera is the weakest point. I paid a lot more for this camera than I did for my last point and shoot. I thought I was upgrading and so I expect quality AND design to be better. I feel so frustrated every time I reach into its protective pouch to find the cap has popped off yet again and I accidentally put my finger right on the lens or find that the loose cap has been rubbing the lens the whole time I've been walking around. If the worst part about the camera is the lens cap, then maybe that is a good thing but I find myself not taking it with me sometimes because of the stupid lens cap.

cameras,Wonderful for a small camera!,Christopher H.,R3UZDZV94MNP2T,3,"This camera is decent, though my much cheaper and smaller Canon that broke (due to my clumsy foot) gave much higher quality pictures than this camera. I do like it, and a lot of people comment on it when I am using it, probably due to the nice display and general aesthetic beauty of the camera itself. I was told how the Leica designed lens gave this camera a superb quality etc., etc., etc. It does not live up to the hype in my opinion.A friend of mine, who I consider the best photographer I have ever known, advised me to get this camera. Though he had not used it, he is very savvy in the photography world and had read everything about it as it was being released.Thus, I originally gave this camera a rave review due to my excitement of getting a new and decent camera, but I had not put it to the test as I ought to have before I first reviewed it.There are several pre-made settings which I do not find impressive, especially compared to much cheaper cameras I have had in the past. If you are looking for a small camera for hiking, or leisurely walking around town, I suggest that you get a cheaper, smaller camera from a respectable company and save some scratch for a nice dinner or something.

cameras,Sold my Canon G11 for this - regret it - will be going back.,Todd Gilbert,R1DPDY7PP1WM9B,3,"I don't know why - but I sold my G11 about a month ago. I replaced it with a Panasonic GF-1 that while I really like the camera - it is just to big to be my compact (primary is a 5D2). I plan on selling the GF-1 to pay for it's replacement. That was to be the LX5, G12, S95 or TL500/EX1. I tried the LX5 first and frankly - am quite disappointed.Pros:1. 24mm f/2 Wide Angle - love it.2. Love the aspect ratio switch that ISN'T just cropping the main 4:3 aspect ratio. The 16:9 24MM angle of view is very impressive - my favorite thing about the camera by far. I originally went with this over the S95 strictly for the 24mm FOV and it is great after seeing it.3. 3FPS while shooting raw is pretty cool.4. Zoom/AF during video is also very nice.5. Hotshoe - definitely a must have and the primary reason it got picked over a S90/5.6. Battery life is pretty good - another reason it got picked over S90/5.Cons:1. When composing - the camera quadruples the pixels on the back screen - so only after you take the photo is the 460K dot screen actually utilized. This is a huge drawback and makes a camera that came out last week feel dreadfully dated in use.2. Image quality is really just ok - my G11 was way better. I shoot raw exclusively - and I have to use Lightroom's noise reduction even when shot at ISO 80 to get creamy soft skys.3. As stated the screen above isn't 460K all the time - but I also didn't realize how much I loved the swivel screen of the G11.4. Video quality is ok - but I don't want to fire up iMovie every time I want to dump stuff off a card - wish it was a self contained file like the h.264 out of Canon.5. Menu system feels like a 1999 camera - very dated and disorganized.6. Build quality feels just ok - the G11 or TL500 are both built like tanks - this just doesn't have that feel.7. The lens cap is crap and adds too much thickness - I much prefer the G11/S95's automatic cap.8. When you turn the camera off after taking photos in succession or a video (where the buffer is used) - the lens doesn't retract immediately. You have to wait for the camera to finish writing to the card before you can put that dreadful lenscap back on. I bought a faster memory card and that did improve it - but I never had this problem with my G11.Really I suppose what I want just isn't here yet. I want a Canon menu system GF-1 with a 24mm equiv f/1.8 pancake lens that will fit in my pocket.The closest I think I will get to that - is the Samsung TL500 Black 10-megapixel Digital CameraBut it might just be too big - so I want to try out the Canon PowerShot S95 10 MP Digital Camera with 3.8x Wide Angle Optical Image Stabilized Zoom and 3.0-Inch inch LCD or even a used S90 as they are CHEAP now.","September 5, 2010",

cameras,I wouldn't shoot over 800 ISO. Consider Canon S95 .,Mark A. Bajek,R5SMI12089KGW,3,"I normally shoot canon point and shoots but after laying waste to three of them over 5 years, I decided to give panasonic a try. And I really want to like this camera.I use them primarily as a backup to Nikon DSLRs while walking around or to shoot over my steering wheel or out a window while driving blindfolded and drinking coffee. (just kidding , I've given up coffee).I've used most recently Sd 800, A720, and S90's for this purpose. The S90 if it's actually working correctly can take a pretty good snap. Even the A720 shoots pretty well in available light and it seems more balanced than the panasonic. (but they're both not really pocket cams). The A 720 works surprisingly well one handed in decent light while at 70 mph. I wish the lenses were more sealed against the elements, but they're not....so in high winds like I sometimes shoot things (dust) can sometimes..ruin a little camera.So my 720 after 10000 shots has sensor issues, and my s 90 even after being repaired by canon continues to have intermittant focus issues and can now only focus at 24. (but I mostly shoot it wide anyway)..So just before leaving for a long 7200 mile road trip I bought a panasonic as a walk about camera and maybe shoot it while driving (but that cap issue is a real drawback). It has decent specs, decent reviews and it's not too too big ...yeah it is..too big. too heavy,cap is annoying as heck..It's a heavy little guy. certainly not as pocketable as an s90/95 and it seems at least at night, not to shoot as reliably as the S90. and not having an integrated cap? at this price level? means, you're using a case of some sort. It's not in your pant pocket. It's strapped to your neck or in a case on your belt....not nearly as available as an S90/95. Not nearly as concealed.It does feel substantial and with both the s90/95 and panasonic transfer cold from metal to skin fast. (wear thin gloves in 20 or below weather or you're hands will get cold really fast).The Panasonic certainly doesn't work well at all while driving....I'm not sure if it's the bulk , or the weight to one side while holding it while driving with the other hand. It just doesn't work well. You've got to take off the cap, power it up, and shoot. With the canon's, you just power it up....point it out the window at 100 mph and fire away. No real worry about the cap...no excessive wind resistance, not any more so than holding your hand palm up out the window, the panasonic....just handles differently one handed. I might just have to practice more one handed with it, popping off the cap , blindly one handed., but you can hold an S90 or A series canon out the window of a moving car with one hand and not really fear dropping it. and fire it with a finger on your left hand or your thumb or finger on your right depending on which hand you're shooting with. The panasonic not so much.... and it's probably button placement to weight ratio with one hand issue with my tiny little hands. It's a special application use that it fails miserably at. Score one for Canon.The picture quality seems OK in daylight to dusk, night it's a bit less capable hand held than the Canon 90 in very dark situations. I don't know why yet , I've only shot under 3000 pictures and haven't really inspected the shots that well. But the canon seem less grainly for shots taken of the same subject at similar settings.(yeah I carry at least two cameras at all times while walking around, maybe three, thank goodness for cargo shorts.) I made the mistake with the panasonic of shooting a series of dusk after sunset shots at 1600 hand held, and it's a bit too grainy over 800. Usable maybe at 1600 but pretty grainy.As is the S90. But the S90 seems to take a more stable picture at a lower ISO even as low as 80 compared to the Panasonic....and it's really easy to change settings on the Canon via the rings. the panasonic isn't hard...but the Canon seems easier. You don't have to look at the display as often or maybe its a twist of the rings on the canons vs. to a sequence of button presses on the panasonic that make the difference in handling feel better leaning toward the Canon S90/95.I can almost reliably be sitting in my car at a traffic light at an intersection and snap a half way decent shot at night on the s90 at 80-100 iso thru an car open window. Yet the panasonic for some reason and it might just be the way I hold the two cameras, even if I'm standing on the street with the panasonic at 800 the canon seems to best it at 200 , maybe the stabilization systems are different,. Could be I'm moving a tad bit more with the panasonic balancing differently. IF I have enough time to get the shot off with the panasonic while at a light...it doesn't seem to do as well.It's nice that it shoots wider 24 v 28. and can zoom kinda far. but if I'm missing shots? due to camera operational time lag 4 mm means nothing. It's still is missed shot.And I do like some aspects of the panasonic's handling. But I think it's gonna be a second place finisher to a new now discontinued replacement s 95 to my now 28mm only S90. . (even with all the little problems users report). The S100 seems to get dim fast after 28mm. But it might be worth looking at too for the extra 100 smackers considering I do sometimes forget just where I took a particular shot. (gps) and maybe it can shoot more reliably and with less noise in low light. The other CMOS Canon I own the SD4000 is a royal piece of kit....couldn't shoot it's way out of a wet paper bag ......just a waste . So not all little canons work well either.","October 17, 2011",

I wanted to replace my Canon 8mp, because the battery door was broke. The Canon camera is a point and shoot, that takes excellent pictures. This Lumix DMC LX5 tends to overexpose in the auto mode. There is no way to adjust the flash like there are with the other manual settings on this camera. It would be nice, because when you want a fast shot indoors, the auto mode isn't the best choice. When you check the picture out after the indoor shot, there's always overexposure areas blinking (this camera shows what is overexposed in the picture) and are very washed out because of the brightness in the picture. Also the Lumix (Panasonic) battery doesn't last that long. You need to have a backup battery and they're expensive.","May 13, 2012",

cameras,Looked better on paper,Robert C. Vincent,R3R4SPFD9OS3LW,3,"I purchased this camera to replace a Canon SD1000 that I purchased nearly 5 years ago. Nearly 50% of my photos are taken inside my house of my dogs, wife, etc. With the Canon I had issues with the white balance and the sensitivity. Many of my pictures would come out orangeish and grainy. I upgraded to the DMC-LX5 to alleviate this, the large sensor (bigger than the S100 which I was also looking at) as well as the f 2.0 lens made this look to be the perfect camera for these shots.Now, just to break from that line of thought, when I was looking for the right camera for this job I saw so many posts on camera forums with people asking for the miracle point and shoot. Something that is good for children / animals and fast movement in low light. Responses invariably involved suggestions of a DSLR. The point being that this type of shooting is difficult for the average point and shoot camera. Well, when I want into this my Canon could shoot in my house with only some extra grain and white balance issues. With the upgrade I wasn't looking for perfection, only something better.So, back to my experience. When the DMC-LX5 arrived it was mid-day on a Saturday. Photo's inside the house were great, the video was smooth. I really liked what I was getting into. Then as the shadows became longer I continued taking shots, mostly in the Intelligent Auto mode which worked well. But around dusk, I was ending up with more blurry images. Spoiled by my last point and shoot things like aperture speed and ISO have fallen from my mind so I had to read the manual, the manual on the CD, and start looking up information online. Over the remainder of the night Saturday and the night on Sunday I took quite a few pictures. Adjusting everything that the camera offered. Using different scene modes, ISO settings, shutter speeds, taking photos in RAW, tweaking them on the computer end...And after all of this, I still ended up with blurry photos. I thought that I was being hard on the LX5, expecting too much. So I turned on my treadmill and set it to the lowest speed, 0.5 mph and threw a sneaker on the treadmill. Then I started the side by side test, using an ISO of 800 which is fairly clear I took photos of this shoe moving past with the LX5 and with the 1000SD. In nearly every case the LX5 either gave a unusable dark image or a blurry mess. Meanwhile the 1000SD consistently gave very noisy images but they were still not that bad, you could see the sneaker and it was reasonably bright.I posted one of these photos in the shared area. Still, I don't know why this occurred. I contacted Panasonic and they put me through the usual steps but it was repetitive to what I had already been doing, I only called because I was worried that I had a defective camera. I don't know if the image processing is just a little more geared toward those types of shots in the SD1000 or what but I just couldn't live with using the LX5 for the type of shooting that I do. Still, at comparable ISO and shutter settings it always gave a brighter image than the SD1000 it's just the issue with movement of the subject. So, back to the drawing board for me. It just looked so good by the numbers...Think I'm going to get a Sony NEX and get it over with. I did love the camera body, and the customization was awesome. I think that this is a great camera but it's not good for what I needed it for.","April 13, 2012",
cameras,"A decent camera if you shoot RAW, otherwise look elsewhere",Rich,R1QSSGP1NX9TF5,3,"I got this camera as an upgrade to an existing point and shoot. In that regard, it is a noticeable improvement. At ISO200 and below, pictures are sharp and fairly noise free even at 100% zoom. With the bright lens and good image stabilization, pictures that would be a blurry on my old point and shoot come out well.As compared to the Canon S90, which is the only other high end compact camera I've used, I'm a little disappointed. This camera is noisy at ISO400 and very noisy at ISO800. The built in JPEG processor has no idea what to do with this all noise, and turns it into yellow blotches (among other things). This seems to be a known problem with the camera, as it's noted in the CNET review and various other forums. Panasonic wasted nearly two weeks of my time claiming they could fix this blotchiness problem if I mailed in the camera, only to return the camera to me in the exact same state I sent it to them, two days after Amazon's 30 day return policy expired.If you have software that does good chroma noise reduction like Adobe Camera Raw, you can get usable shots at ISO800 and good shots at ISO400, but you're another $100 out of pocket at that point. The included raw processing software (Silkypix) does not have a good chroma noise reduction algorithm, so it's basically worthless for this camera.If I had it all to do over again, I'd buy a Canon.","April 25, 2012",

cameras,Fine For What It Is But Not Worth The Expense,T. Good,RIKRU5G76DBZ3,3,"I just returned an LX5 after a week for the following reasons:1. Primarily, every picture I took with this camera in RAW, I said to myself afterward afterward, ""I wish I had just taken my D300 with me instead.""2. Everyone, including yours truly, is seduced by the notion the LX5 and its counterparts are great walking around cameras that can shoot RAW and offer a number of other important options, not the least of which are manual control and a fast lens. While it is true one can walk around with this camera stuffed in a shirt pocket as opposed to any DSLR, it is still somewhat more bulky than real compacts especially with its lens and cap. A camera bag over the shoulder or a camera with strap slung around the neck is not going to be as comfortable, but if one is concerned primarily with imagery and its qualities, shirt pockets come in a distant second. In other words, see number 1 above.3. The images from this camera can easily be printed at a large size, but they cannot in any way compare to those from a larger sensor. The lens has a limited zoom range, too, which makes it less optimal than some of its competitors. I noticed far too much noise even at ISO 200 when shooting in lower light. I was stunned by this result. I also think the color saturation is too intense though shooting in RAW provides options.In the end, to spend nearly $500 on a camera that is inferior in most regards to its bigger brethren isn't worth it to me. I would get a less expensive compact camera and use it for snapshots and less demanding images. I'd take the savings and put them toward a DSLR or lens that in the end will yield far better results. BTW, I have successfully printed files from an old Canon Powershot 850 at 18X13"" inches with great satisfaction. That camera cannot match the LX5 for control, but when I want real control I use my D300.","October 12, 2010",
cameras,Upgrade caution for LX3 owners,ghmcs,R3T9U1ISBHOKRT,3,"This review is for LX3 owners who are considering an upgrade to the LX5. There are several differences you should be aware of:1) The LX3 lens/filter adapter, and any 46mm filter, is not usable on the LX5. Panasonic changed the filter thread to 52mm.2) The LX5 scroll wheel is not an improvement on the LX3 joystick. I don't have large hands, but the LX5 scroll wheel is recessed and difficult to push unless you use a fingernail.3) On the LX3, exposure compensation is a dedicated button on the 4-way controller and you change aperture (or shutter speed) setting with the joystick. LX5 exposure compensation and aperture are only accessible by pushing the scroll wheel once or twice. These settings require more button presses with the LX5 implementation. Although there is an assignable Function key on the LX5 4-way controller, you can't assign it to exposure compensation.4) On the LX3, exposure bracketing is accessible through the exposure compensation screen. On the LX5, bracketing is only available through a separate menu item.5) The labels printed on the LX5 4-way controller keys are barely legible.6) The LX3 came with a full printed manual; the LX5 does not.Bottom line, I've returned the LX5 and am keeping my LX3. Besides my investment in 46mm filters, I want ready access to aperture and exposure compensation settings, and the LX5 user interface for those settings is not as good as the LX3.","June 20, 2011",

cameras,"Mediocre Image quality, noisy images, dated sensor, excellent build, design, optics",F. Khan,R2QEZWJGAJNXB,3,"I REALLY REALLY wanted to love this camera but after using it for a few months I have to say i felt it was over rated/hyped. This camera has a lot of great qualities, and as the rating indicates many people are happy with it. My main complaint is the high level of noise even at low ISOs. I looked at all the images from a recent trip and there was a LOT of noise at ISOs between 200-400 which should be well within the abilities of a $3-400 camera. From what i hear it's due to a 5-7yr old sensor... the same used in the lx3. It has a lot more control than the basic P&S; canon but so what if that doesn't amount to better quality images (in my experience). I did also try a Canon s90 for a few months about a year ago and had the same complaints. About 1/2 the images I got from the s90 were amazing... the other half very very noisy with terrible blown out highlights. The lx5 is better (but not great) about preventing blown out highlights, but created less ""keepers"" than the s90. Maybe I expect too much from this class of camera but I don't think so. Clean noise free images in daylight with ISOs between 100-400 shouldn't be difficult for these cameras. At the end of the day I honestly can say i didn't think it took better pictures or 720p video than my Canon 780 IS... and for the money I decided to stick with my cheap, highly pocketable and impressive (for the $125) Canon 780IS.Other negatives: No 1080p video (in this day and age? for that price? really?), It's a bit bulky to keep in your front pocket but it's possible, horrible sun flares in video mode, menu navigation takes a bit of getting used to (not a biggie), popup flash can be blocked by your finger, lens cap design (would rather it be a built in cover so you don't have to remember where you put it at all times).Positive qualities: Good in low light (but often bad in daylight), Excellent build quality, design, zoom in video mode, dedicated video button, great low light performance, looks awesome.","February 5, 2012",
cameras,Good lens alone does not make good pictures,hx1,RXTSDG06K91B1,3,"I am returning this camera to Amazon.com for a refund.I was in the market for a high-quality compact point and shoot with a fast lens and bought this camera based on the glowing reviews it's been receiving. However, I am not satisfied for the following reasons:1. The Leica lens is very sharp and fast. I love the f/2.0 aperture. However, as stated in the title of this review, a good lens by itself does not make good pictures... The electronics and the hardware just do not do justice for this lens. Too bad!2. The jpeg engine in this camera is pretty lousy. raw is clearly sharper than jpeg for the same pictures. To add to the insult, one cannot select raw format when the camera is in full auto ""i.something"" picture taking mode. Only jpeg is available there...3. The full auto ""i.something"" picture mode is pretty stupid and does not make full use of the fast lens. Even in decent light, it often selects ISO of 400, 800 etc... resulting in grainy and noisy pictures for what would otherwise be really nice pictures if a larger aperture is used in connection with a lower ISO number setting.4. The auto face recognition autofocus often locks onto the wrong face/object in the frame, causing great irritation/inconvenience at best and lost picture taking opportunities at worse. Note that the full auto ""i.something"" mode does not allow for center focusing, and one would be at full mercy of this lousy auto face recognition monster.5. The mode selection dial and the zoom lever decided to quit working suddenly one day in the middle of a photoshoot. They both became sticky, like molasses. The zoom lever in particular does not ""spring"" back to the center as normal but rather sticks at the zooming locations, causing the lens to continually zoom.6. The picture aspect ratio selector switch is a joke. It allows one to select the picture aspect ratios of 1:1, 4:3, 3:2, 16:9, etc.... But one can always change the picture ratios or crop them in one's favorite photoshop software. To add to insult, the selector slider is in a place where it could easily be moved by accident. Just give me the aspect ratio of the full sensor frame and let me crop later, thank you very much.7. No indication on the camera when the macro focus is activated. This caused me to walk around taking pictures all-day on macro focus when I accidentally hit the focus mode selector slider and hit macro focus.8. Somehow, subject's faces almost always come out to be slightly soft and off-colored a little compared to other objects like clothing, hair, etc... Skin tone just looks weird.9. Data writes to the SDHC card seemed to take a long time. I have a class 10 SDHC card, formatted by this exact camera, and it frequently took 4-5 seconds at times before I could take another picture.So the search for a high-quality compact point and shoot continues for me. I now know it's not this Panasonic camera! Just ignore the rave reviews you see for this camera. Panasonic needs a LOT more work, even with the slick Leica lens.","June 1, 2011",
cameras,"Not the most user-friendly, and weird shadow when using flash when shooting close up",justwanttotellyou,R3CGD0QH06XNM5,3,"Hi, it's been about three weeks since I got this camera. I switched from my 7 year old Sony DSV1 since I felt it was really slow, especially when I had to use flash (long recovery time) and I kept missing the best moments trying to shoot my active 1 year old son. I also wanted something with a better video quality.So far, I must say I'm not too impressed with the camera. I'm satisfied enough with the quality of the photos, but it hasn't floored me compared to my old Sony. Here are my impressions:Pro:1) It is a nice looking camera. I got the white version. It is traditional looking but fashionable. I was afraid that it would feel too big, but it wasn't for me -- but I wasn't looking for a camera to put in my pocket either.2) HD video quality is amazing, but since I mostly upload videos online, I decided to use the .mov format most of the time.Con:1) Even in auto-flash mode, the flash doesn't automatically pop up; I need to manually open it with a button. This slows down shooting.2) I realized that in automatic/program modes, I cannot force flash easily. The only options that are readily available are auto flash (when the flash is open) or off (when flash is closed). In order to get it to force flash, red eye reduction or other flash modes, I need to get into menu options, 5-6 pages down, and get into flash menu and select that option. Of course, if I'm on a move shooting my son or traveling and happen to see a nice scene, but back lit etc., I don't have that much time to be scrolling through the menus. I ended up using a couple of custom settings to save various flash settings, but it feels very odd that that they don't give more flash options in a user-friendly way.3) It isn't that fast. It takes a while for the camera to set exposure/focus. It often takes 2-4 seconds to adjust focus and exposure. It has happened indoors in reasonably lit conditions with regular lighting. It seems like if I know I'd be shooting in one room for a while I have to use the AE lock so shooting would be quicker after the first photo - feels like I shouldn't have to do that - frustrating.4) In the movie mode, there's a significant lag (1-2 seconds) between when I press the shutter button to when it starts shooting. Again, it seems like it's taking time to focus.5) When I use flash in macro mode (or maybe just close to the subject - slightly less than a foot), it give a ring of a dark area (where flash does not reach) in the lower right corner of the picture. I'm shooting using 4:3 ratio. Is it impossible to make flash reach the corner of this ratio format when you're too close? I thought it's because of the lense cover that I bought separately that's blocking the flash so I took that off and tested it. It is better, but there is still a dark area (thinner than with the cap, like a line) in the bottom right corner. I was using 3:2 when I tested.6) The macro mode (as well as AF/MF modes) selection is on the lense dial. Not as bad as other ""con""s listed here, but I find it inconvenient, since I have to take my eyes off the viewer/screen to adjust it (whereas my old Sony or Canon had it in the back panel where I could quickly adjust using my thumb while looking through the viewer, my finger on the shutter button ready to shoot).I'm not sure if I got a lemon (flash in macro mode, slowness adjusting, etc.) or I'm missing some more convenient control options that the camera has available. If I'm missing something, I'd appreciate someone letting me know. If it seems like I got a lemon, I'd like to know that too so I can return it. Overall so far in terms of ease of use, I can't give this camera high marks.","June 29, 2011",

cameras,Battery costs & availability,Chicago Slim,ROJGPMOHE0YJD,3,"I have rated this as 3 stars but that's not my final rating. It is just to catch the attention of anyone who might be buying this camera right now, because there's an excessive cost, in my view, for an extra battery. The cheapest battery I have found for this camera costs 80 dollars. So I haven't bought a spare battery yet - I hope the price comes down! I've only found a couple of places that sell it - none on Amazon. And there don't seem to be any off-brand substitutes for the Panasonic version. This is problematical anyway, because I anticipate, from reading about the LX3, that off-brand batteries are not reliable with this camera line.Putting aside the battery cost, the camera seems to be pretty much what I was looking for. I bought this camera for my wife. It is way too much camera for her in many respects, but it has some advantages that aren't present in other compact cameras. Unfortunately, this means that the camera is about twice as big as I'd like it to be, but that's just an unfortunate tradeoff for the features I regard as advantages.The first advantage is a manual picture mode selection dial. This is the sort of thing that used to be the way you set the camera to capture scenery, portraits, etc. Unfortunately, there is a digital screen component to doing this, but at least one can start with making a manual selection.A second advantage is the wide angle lense. We are always taking pictures indoors, and most of them suffer from the lense not being sufficiently wide angle to get a good shot of all of the room. This one does. Add to that a mild telephoto zoom, almost 4X optical, and most of our needs are covered. Unfortunately, there's not any optical zoom which would allow for in camera framing of distance shots - ball games, etc. But that can be taken care of on the computer, given the 10 megapixels.One thing that I did not realize that this camera has is a manual switch to change the aspect ratio. Very nice.There are only a couple of things I'm not pleased with so far. One of them is that the battery compartment requires a manual switch to lock shut. In other words, it does not automatically click into place when the cover is shut, but requires that the lock be slid back into place. The second is that the still/video switch is a button placed close to the shutter/zoom button. This looks like an accident waiting to happen, but maybe that won't turn out to be a problem. And finally, the lens cap is not attached to the camera with a cord. Oddly, the cap has provision for one, but there's none in the box, & I don't see where it would be attached to the camera anyway. Maybe to one of the neckstrap bars.","September 12, 2010",

Picture quality and color is noticeably inferior to the SLR. Lumix has wide angle; but pictures show distortion. This camera is definitely not a replacement for your SLR.,"February 6, 2011",
cameras,Battery Issue,Key,R1EA7GZBQ2ISGZ,3,"OK, I just received my camera today. And to be fair, I haven't been able to turn it on yet. So I don't know how well it operates. I haven't been able to turn it on because the battery was not included in the package!!! I have contacted Panasonic and they are researching the problem. Meanwhile I can't use my camera. I've looked to purchase a replacement battery to use until Panasonic sends mine. But unfortunately I can't find one anywhere. Replacement batteries are not available in the US at this time. And the battery warranty only lasts 90 days. So if your battery dies you will have an expensive paperweight. Hopefully Panasonic gets those in stock soon.","October 8, 2010",

cameras,Not for me,ailin98,R1MOK8ZODHBPVA,3,"Before getting this camera I made extensive research about it. I was really into the LEICA D-LUX 5 and decided to get this one instead just for the price. At the beginning I was very excited, it seem like a little jewel. I'm a filmmaker so all the features on this camera amazed me, I thought I could get similar pictures than with an XLR but with the convenience of the size.When I started taking photos, the point and shoot photos were amazing. But when I wanted to take it to the next level, I just realized it could not compete with an XLR. It wasn't only about the interchangeable lenses, but also about the manual features, they are great, but not competitive. Also the settings are not as intuitive, meaning that it takes a little bit to set and maybe for that time the subject has already moved. I know is not a photojournalist camera, but I have had other cameras that are in the price and features range easier to navigate.I return it just because in my situation, this wasn't what I expected. But I'm sure for other people out there this is a cool one to have.","November 27, 2011",
cameras,Good quality. Too complicated to use.,"Bernardo J. Rodriguez ""Bernardo""",R3GCD5G2G4TE0L,3,"The camera quality is very good, but it is too complicated to use. Not intuitive.

cameras,A lot more to be wanted,"GS ""I don't like sales tax""",R2Q3CWOXGN4VD6,3,"This is my 5th Canon (G2, S30, A530, XSi) and is supposedly Canon's best ever P&S.; I bought this for its compactness, low light performance, and image quality. In these regards I would say it is excellent! But for its price I would expect something that is top of the line on most aspect which I found out not true.What I don't like and wish the Canon Guy take note (most serious come first):1. Most people complained about the flash design which is true and very very annoying. I have gone through 2 trips and 3000 photos. I still get surprised whenever the flash turns active and push my left index finger out. The camera has safeguard measure so that whenever it detects that the flash movement is blocked it will stop and issue a warning signal. The only way to reset it is to switch the camera OFF and then ON again. I have gone through this procedure around 10 times a day during my trips. Because of this I expect the first thing to fail for my S95 would be the flash. And I would not expect it to last as long as my G2 (9 years and still going strong). CANON GUY, PLEASE MAKE THE CAMERA A LITTLE TALLER AND PUT THE FLASH FIXED IN YOUR NEXT VERSION !!!2. The internal micro-processor is too slow and the firmware design cannot handle real time event. In layman terms, S95 responded too slow in every aspect. One example is after I finished a shot and then quickly turn the front wheel to change exposure compensation and prepare taking another shot, I found out the camera did not respond to my front wheel adjustment at all. It had to wait until it finished rounding up the previous job (and it took a while to finish!) before it has time to register any change on the wheels and buttons. So if you acted too soon it will totally disregard it. The killing part is the processing usually take long. So beware user: don't think you can shoot like a professional fast and quick between photos, you have to pace yourself and make sure u don't press buttons and adjust wheels too fast. CANON FIRMWARE GUYS: PLEASE SET UP AN EVENT QUEUE AND USE INTERRUPT TRIGGER TO RECORD ALL USER'S INPUT, SO THAT THEY CAN BE PROCESSED LATER, MY PANASONIC ELECTRONIC RICE COOKER DO A BETTER JOB THAN S95 IN THIS REGARD!!!3. This one is the deal breaker. It cannot auto focus during video recording! This make the video feature seriously handicapped. Althought S95 has small lens and a deep depth of field, you still find the video constantly out of focus when your kids are running around you while u r shooting them. I thought I would have spent $400 and get something that can at least do good photos and video. Well, it can only do half of it and I guess I have to wait for something better in the near future. Just for reference my $100 Samsung can autofocus during video recording!!!4. WB and some other adjustments not allowed to work in most SCN modes, which make the SCN shooting modes seriously handicapped.5. My favorite Stitch Assist Mode (for taking panoramic-view picture) works only in landscape, not portrait mode.6. The rear dial is much improved over the S90 (not as loose) but still easy to turn by mistake. I have many occasions of changing the ISO from AUTO to 3200 by mistake. When I find out it is already too late and I got a dozen grainy photos!7. Battery last only 100-150 photos in practical use and so need at least 2 batteries for a day's photo. If you are doing video, expect to bring half a dozen !!!8. The image stabilization (IS) is not very effective. I closely examined the LCD screen images when IS is both engaged and not engaged. The difference is very subtle and nothing compared with Rebel XSi (SLR) in which the image motion is obviously smooth out and slowed down. The salesperson told me don't expect any serious IS capability from P&S;' I wonder if that's true.9. The lens is fast (F2.0) at wide end only. But at zoom end it is very slow (F4.9). My G2 has F2-F2.5 throughout the whole zoom range. I can understand it's a limitation imposed by the size of the lens, not Canon's fault. Coupled with an ineffective IS, I got a lot of blurry pictures at max zoom under cloudy sky outdoor. I have very steady hands and I hold my breath when I press shutter, and my wife could do much worse. I wish Canon would put a better but little bigger lens in the next version. F2.0-3.5 would be a good compromize.In summary, you would think the S95 is wonderful when you play with it shortly at Best Buy. The picture quality and LCD's display quality are superb too. But when you bought it home and put it to use in real life, you will find out a lot more to be wanted and that it's too far from being perfect at all. Some shortcomings like the video focusing are in my opinion a design fault, others are inconvenience and annoyance. The Canon Guys should have done much more than just a touch-up of S90. I waited a long time and paid $400 for a camera like S95 and thought this would be the ultimate pocket P&S; that will last me a long long time. Well definitely it is not simply for reason like the half-cooked video recording capability. FORTUNATELY OR UNFORTUNATELY, ALTHOUGH WITH ALL THOSE SHORTCOMINGS, IT IS STILL THE BEST POCKET P&S; ON MARKET, NO OTHER BETTER CHOICE YET.In my opinion Canon still makes the best digital P&S; and I might stay a Canon buyer in the future. But my advise to Canon is to stop abusing loyalty of fans like me. And make products that really live up to its name. For those who already got a decent P&S;, I would recommend hold your purchase until S99, S100 or whatever which at least solve the flash and video fault.=====================================================================Update 8/1/2011After 10 months and 5800 shoots, the lens stuck midway while power on. Manufacturer replaced the optical module. This is my first Canon that needed service within 1st year of purchase. A little disappointed and worried.","October 20, 2010",
cameras,"Good camera. However, probably not a better value than the S90",Brad A. Totman,R37E6WR2ETKPUG,3,"I have a T2i, G11, S90, and now the S95. I really love the size of the camera and the fact it is pocket-able. It can take pics on the same level as the G11. I do miss the hot shoe but not the size of the G11. I do have more misfires than the G11, and certainly more than the T2i. However, I am disappointed in the video. I bought the S95 for the HD video. The G11 takes great video (albeit Standard Definition). The S90 takes okay video but noticeably inferior to the video I've taken with my G11 (even if they are supposed to have the same sensor, there's a definite difference). In fact, I think I liked the video from my old SD1200 better than the S90's. The S95 while 720p, is vastly inferior in quality to the T2i (@ 720p) and really doesn't look much better than the G11's Standard Def. Yeah, it's 720p, but it looks much more grainy and seems to lack clarity, even in outdoor and well lit video. I wasn't expecting video on par with the T2i (at 1080p or 720p) but I certainly expected more than I got. The lack of auto-focus and optical zoom with video is an annoyance. And while I consider video a secondary feature, I would still like it to be good. The upgrades over the S90 aren't anything great. It's not a bad camera (it's quite good) but I don't think it's worth the premium over the S90 for the few extra features you get.And another gripe is Adobe Lightroom 3.2 does not yet support S95 RAW files. Not a knock against the camera or Canon, I understand Adobe works in cycles to add cameras. Though I do wonder why the 60D already is compatible while the S95 is out and is not. It's still something it's target buyer should be aware of (I wasn't until I tried to import the RAW files).Edited on 9/22/10 - One feature that I really like about the S95 that I didn't think about until using an S90 again was the ability to set a Maximum Auto ISO. I would definitely miss that as that is something I use a lot.","September 13, 2010",
cameras,Nice Camera,"Cortina ""LC""",R3N6KOU6EMUIZC,3,"I had the Canon S90 when it first came out and loved loved loved it so I was excited to see this newest updated version. I bought the Canon S95 recently on Amazon and I am not disappointed! The picture quality is the same, excellent, and the body is even better. I have not had any issues or problems with it. I don't particularly love where the flash pops up but honestly its a small inconvenience for the quality of photos you get out of this camera and I'll get used to it Im sure. I'm still learning all of the functions, there are many, but all in all for portability and fantastic image quality this point and shoot rises to the challenge and may I say above the other Canons and Sonys Ive had. FYI, I recently ordered a screen protector for the LCD from Screen Patronus online and just put it on. Its a perfect fit for the S95. They only custom size to the model of camera you have and you get three. Totally worth the price for preserving your screen. Amazon customer service is stellar. Ive never had a problem that wasnt solved quickly.*UPDATE*Well, I have to backtrack a bit. First I am not a professional photographer but enjoy quality images and experimenting. I have an appreciation for photography and have a little knowledge in it. Also, I believe when it comes down to what is the best camera for you it takes experimenting a lot, and personal preference especially since both the LX5 and the S95 seem to be above and beyond others. I travel a good deal and want great photos. Having said that, after using the Canon S95 for a while I wasn't completely satisfied with the images overall. I used it in various lighting and conditions. They seemed to have a softness, albeit slight, that I couldn't get past. I shot with two different S95s and both produced the same results. My original S90 didnt have this issue. I don't know why. I used it the same way. This is simply what I experienced. While I had my S95 I had also been looking at reviews and specs for the Panasonic Lumix LX5. I took the plunge and returned the Canon recently and bought the Lumix. Ive never owned a Panasonic before. I'm even more impressed with the LX5. There was a noticeable difference in the image sharpness on Program mode, shadows seemed better and focus was crisp. For me, it feels more secure in my hand, the image quality is really exceptional( I think better than the S95 although I have not tried as many low light shots), and the color is rich but also can be natural. Also some the ""My Color Mode"" options are super! The lens is faster as well. It is a bit bigger than the S95 but for me I don't really ""pocket"" my camera most of the time anyways so it wasn't a deterrent. I usually have it in a belt pouch or in a bag. The Canon S95 is more pocketable and still produces images waaaaaay better than most out there, especially low light, but I will be keeping the LX5 because so far, and I have not tried every function yet, it has won me over completely.","October 19, 2010",
cameras,Awesome images. Lens error in a month.,Brandt,R2XH0MVK70WAL6,3,"This is the best Canon compact I have had in about 3 years. Picture quality is awesome, and low light performance rocks. I will write more details later, but for now I am frustrated.I pulled the camera out of the case today to find the lens partially extended and the dreaded ""Lens Error. Will shut down automatically. Please restart camera."" Otherwise known as a E18 error. I've restarted the camera numerous times, and at no point has the motor made any noise, or has the lens moved. I can't say how frustrating this is. Mostly because I have become quite attached to this one is a short time, and it's part of my daily routine. I hope it'll be covered under warranty.. Updates to come.How about an option for resetting this error, or attempting to move the lens manually with the zoom control. Anything that would allow the user to troubleshoot this. I have to believe that things are set up to fail safe, and there is room for some trying. Otherwise Canon has a serious problem with lens extension mechanisms.","May 20, 2011",
cameras,Love it . . . BUT,E. Martin,R2PYTHRSRXCUWU,3,"I love this camera. It takes some gorgeous pictures. I usually shoot with a very expensive DSLR but needed a small point and shoot to take with me when I go hiking or on a bike ride. I've tried many different cameras but this one takes the clearest pictures. I've posted some of my pictures above for you to see for yourself. However (and this is a big one), I have been getting the dreaded ""lens error"" and the camera will just shut off. This lens error makes it so that I can not zoom - AT ALL. As a semi-professional photographer, I know that zooming isn't the best thing to do anyway. So, I move closer whenever possible. But, there are times when I wish I could get closer with the zoom and I can not. If the camera is asked to move the lens in any way (other than to turn on or off), It will give an error message and it will shut off. The camera does work when I turn it back on, but I really don't know how long I have before my beloved camera will never turn on again.Now you can use this information to make an informed decision. Get a great camera and takes some great pictures. But be forewarned, you may have problems with your lens.","April 21, 2012",

cameras,Extremely poor flash placement,"Jason, Engineer, Gadget nut, Father of 3",R25YA6YJBT2ZUF,3,"I bought this camera knowing about the flash placement and thinking it would not be that big of a deal.Well, I should have followed my instincts on this. The typical way that I, my wife and, I believe, most people hold a small camera like this is with the ""pinch"" method of finger and thumb pinching the camera from both ends. This method puts your finger directly over the pop up flash and each thumb under the camera on either side. When the flash needs to come up it forces its way up and you have to move your finger. I returned the camera to Amazon with no hassles.As a gadget and photo nut sometimes it takes the common sense of my wife to look at me and say ""Why would you want a camera that is not designed well?"". Reluctantly I listened to her about this new toy I have purchased and realize that she is right.Image quality was nothing special compared to my Canon SD780is even though review sites like imaging-resource.com show significant improvement in noise and sharpness in the test images. I recently bought the Sony HX5V and have been very pleased with the colors, detail and operation. The colors on these small Canon's all seem to be too ruddy or orange to me when taking people shots with the flash.Just to qualify my review I own and use the following cameras:Nikon D700Nikon D90Canon SD770Canon SD780is","October 15, 2010",

cameras,A Super Camera--Until the Lens Jammed,Amazon Customer,RBX3NJIFNU86H,3,"I have simply loved this camera since I got it 4 months ago--until today, when the infamous ""Lens Error"" message came up, indicating that the zoom mechanism was jammed, making the camera inoperable. Canon tried to fix it over the phone to no avail, so now its in the mail for Canon to fix or replace under warranty.Picture-wise, this camera is just super. It's way better for my purposes than the other two Canons I've owned: the S3IS and the SX20IS. I get much better low-light pictures with this little gem than with either of the others. I attribute that to the f2.0 lens on this little guy. This camera has a 4x zoom, much less than the megazoom of the other cameras, but I didn't mind giving up the zoom to get the low-light performance. I had looked for other cameras that would give me a big lens, and it seemed like the only ones that would do better than the S95 were big expensive digital SLR's.Did I mention that this is a true pocketable camera? When I got it, I put it in my pocket, and it stayed there until today, unless I was actually taking pictures with it.About that ""Lens Error:"" The reason that I don't have that S3IS any more is that it, too, suffered the infamous ""Lens Error."" That was after almost 5 years of service, so I figured I'd gotten good service out of it and got the S95. I had hoped for at least 5 years out of this one, but it failed after only 4 months. And no, I didn't get sand or water in it, or drop it, or bump it, or do anything else to it--other than carry it around in my pocket (which is what a pocket camera is for, right?).UPDATE: Got the ""lens error"" fixed and it worked a couple of years, but now I have the same problem. And no, I haven't dropped it, or put sand in the lens. What a bummer. A great camera, when it works.","October 20, 2011",
cameras,Resolved most but not all S90 issues,G. Jimenez,R1K5ZHS43ZP5EG,3,"This camera is improved over the Canon S90 but there are still some gripes. I owned the Canon S90 but was disappointed with some of its ""features"" and sold it. In my S90 review, I complained that the rear dial floated too freely, the surface was too slippery, and there was no HD video. I'm happy to say that the dial is much improved, the surface has more grip, and it now offers HD video. However, some irks remain. The pop up flash resides exactly where your left index finger holds the camera and will sometimes jam if you hold the camera firmly. I complained that the NB-6L battery had a short life (about 220 shots) but in the S95 the battery life is even shorter (about 200 shots). My remaining complaint against the S90 was that because the F2.0 lens allowed for better low-light shooting, it often shot pictures without the flash in situation where it otherwise should have. This led to many noisy (grainy) pictures. It seems that the S95 has improved slightly in this department too.It's not perfect but for its size is a very admirable camera. I hope that the next version of the camera has a fixed flash and a grip. Even a small grip would help immensely, especially for people with large hands. [...]Also, the pocket manual that came with the S90 was very helpful. For the S95, they decided to provide the guide only in PDF format. I'm all for saving trees but this camera has too many features to not include a pocket manual that you can take on the go.","January 29, 2011",

But I must say I'm a little disappointed with the quality control. I received this camera with a pixel stuck on in the center of the frame. Right in the middle of every photo theres a blue spot no matter what. At this price point for a point and shoot I'm disappointed to be having issues right out of the box and normally I would write it off as an anomaly but I did my research and a lot of people have the same issue and either returned the cams or had to have them warrantied. At least I can easily return it as defective but what a hassle. Canon is slipping on the quality control so make sure if you decide to buy one to thoroughly inspect it.

Don't know if we got a lemon, but it just seemed to lag when focusing and firing the shutter, and when you've got a small, active child (or pet), it can get frustrating when you keep missing those ""cute"" moments.Too bad, because it can certainly create some beautiful photos, and it has a ton of features and capabilities.

I am just starting to get into photography so it allows me to gradually go into more of the manual modes. The reason I am giving this camera a 3 star review is that unfortunately after 6 months of use, I got the dreaded ""Lens Error message"". Apparently this is the only error message that the camera will give you, so it doesn't mean that there is a specific defect that one can ascertain when receiving this message. At least that is what the tech for Canon told me. Just know that it means you can't fix it by yourself. The positive is that the people at Canon were amazing! I called the customer service line, and they immediately gave me the information I needed. They asked for my address and told me where the closest center for canon was to send my camera in and have it fixed. I received the camera back in approximately 10 days. It works great once again. I was still covered under warranty, and I would have been so mad if it had happened 6 month from now. I'm crossing my fingers that everything is okay now.

The color becomes correct only when that is the only color you can see. Oh I have to adjust the white ballance. Now I've got a purple chair with amber walls. I currently use a Panasonic FZ35 no adjustment necessary. Outside an amber object on the edge of the picture becomes yellow and is only correct when it is centered. I've tried to monkey with the different controls but the colors are never right. As a side issue the cd will not load on my windows 7.

cameras,Best compact bar none but fragile,"Edgar Betancourt ""HD Lover""",R3LK5YIZ540S91,3,"I am a diehard Nikon photo enthusiast, but to my chagrin Nikon has not produced a compact camera to rival this little wonder. This little camera takes pictures that are almost SLR quality. Low light performance is excellent as are focusing speed and accuracy. It also has almost instant startup and almost no shutter delay, it even has a usable 2 FPS frame rate! Although it has an almost SLR like menu of options and adjustable parameters including full manual mode, etc, this are really more for show since the camera's small form factor and controls make it difficult to run it in modes other than full auto and the preset scene modes. That said, its amazing that they are available at all and they work well! Its zooming range is small but the lens works very well throught its range. It has none of the terrible pincushioning and chromatic aberrations of long zoom compact cameras. Even the video mode is well executed and tkes very good 720p video! In its default settings it does try to make up for its inherent limitations by producing slighty oversaturated colors, however, this is easily corrected in the color settings. Its main shortcommings are associated to ergonomics, its simply a small box, thus it doesnt have any real handgrip, its buttons are tiny, and the controls for adjusting its comprehensive manual parameters are the barrel and the small rear control rings making them unconventional and a little hard to use. Also caveat emptor: the camera is fragile while the lens is open. Our daughter ""killed"" hers when she dropped it onto a hard surface. All in all, the proof is in the pudding, this its a very small form factor camera that takes excellent pictures even in low light conditions and suffers from none of the usual performnce compromises of compact cameras, it even offers the option of creative photography if you are willing to mess around with its small controls. Only more expensive digital SLRs produce consistently better quality photography and that is probably only noticeable to the critical eye. For a 400 dollar, snapshot size, take anywhere camera, that is high praise indeed. Nikon should be taking notes :)PS: I like it so much I even bought the excellent, full function underwater case for our trip to the caribbean!An update on an otherwise great camera. The S series has proven quite fragile in my expirience. My original S90 died after a drop of around 4 feet onto a fiberglass surface. Our S95 developed battery door issues so it stopped working.

cameras,It seemed too good to be true,Stephen Selph,R21YNXZ0UIHO12,3,"I have been waiting for this camera for several months and the anticipation was more than I could handle waiting for it to come in the mail. The picture quality is amazing and everyone knows that, that is not why I am here to review this little guy. Video is one main selling points for me as I like to shoot when interesting things happen around me when I am never expecting it. The portability and the HD video seemed like this camera would be a match made in heaven for me. But, the video issues ended up being the deal breakers for me. I knew of the problems before purchasing the S95, but I did not realize how much of an issue it was. I have several older P&S; models that can AF and optically zoom while shooting, why can't Canon figure this out? It's almost like that just want to save something for next year's model so people will have reason toupgrade.Also the macro is not on par with even budget P&Ss;, I have to be at least 5cm away to focus in on very small objects. This seems like a minor gripe, but I love to shoot macro. I have taken hundreds of photos with this camera and I just cannot get as close as I would like.So I kept looking around for other options and I think the LX5 has all of the things that I have complaints with from the S95, so I purchased it and it should be here in a couple days right before I leave for the Bahamas. I will do extensive testing comparing both models for my needs. I really am in love with the portability of the S95 and I see myself taking it out more and getting greater photo ops than I would with my larger cameras. I know that the LX5 is $100 more expensive, but when already dropping $40, another $100 isn't going to make a huge difference over the few years I plan on owning it.I will update when I get back from vacation and make my decision on which camera has won me over.","October 10, 2010",

I wish I was aware of this problem before hand. If you still decide to take the risk of purchasing this camera, I recommend the following:1. Never touch the lens unit while shooting photos. 2. Never mistakenly turn it on in a pocket/case. 3. Never use this camera at the beach or anywhere near any sand/dust. 4. Obviously never drop the camera, especially while lens is extended.","July 1, 2011",

cameras,Why no viewfinder?!,M. Reynolds,R1A7ODJHC70W42,3,"I HAD to have this camera when it came out. I upgraded from an older point and shoot and moved to Canon from Nikon just to get the RAW and the easily adjustable aperture - since I love having a camera in my pocket when I travel on business - and not having to carry the D300 I use when I'm a tourist......But just try getting a good picture in the full sun when it is glaring off the screen! Unfortunately this isn't only about this camera as viewfinders on point and shoot cameras have essentially gone extinct. But on a camera like this - and for its likely target audience - it should have a viewfinder.Other than that - it is a nice camera and takes good pictures - but if you are really just using it as a point and shoot on Auto, the lens is a bit short for the price. And fortunately (knocking on wood here), I have not had any of the ""shut down"" issues that I have seen in other reviews......","July 4, 2011",

I own both the G11 and the Ti SLR, but wanted a camera that was small enough to pocket while visiting European cities. The quality of image, features and flexibility (I use the lens ring for exposure compensation) are wonderful. Battery life is somewhat mediocre compared to G11 or other point and shoots, but you'd want a spare battery anyway.I have gotten the dreaded lens error message, which has got me worried. This seems endemic to Canon cameras, but its fatal when it happens. Camera simply refuses to extend lens, and gives you the E18 Lens Error message.

My old camera is a Sony Cyber Shot DSC-H1 from 2005 with a 12x zoom. My sister swears by Canon so I wanted to give this a try. I took the Canon S95 to a wedding rehearsal and the Sony DSC-HX5V to the wedding the next day. I found the the Sony to be easier to use, easier to focus, and I just loved the zoom. I am one who can't live without a good zoom. The Sony has a 10x zoom.This Canon was hard for me to focus for some reason. It didn't focus fast enough. Maybe it is because I am used to Sony, I don't know. I thought I'd give it a try based on all the good reviews, but mine is going back. I also found it was harder to hold than the sony. It didn't feel comfortable in my hands--small with no definitive place to put fingers. The Sony has a nicer feel to it with a spot for your thumb to rest on the back.The CanonS95 is also heavier.

(Perhaps lens' and DSLRs are their cash cow.)I have this camera and a Canon 300 HS (replaced by the 310 HS). The 300 is even smaller and more simple to carry. It is cheaper. Pictures (Auto, Program) are surprisingly close in quality. So is speed. The CMOS sensor on the 300 is excellent and not bad in low light. The 300 is 5x and the S95 is 4x. (RAW is now even possible with the 300.)Somehow, the smaller 300 has better video (e.g., 1080) and a dedicated video button.Yes, the S95 has some advantages (faster lens but only at the wide end) and a better LCD. Of course it has manual controls that the 300 lacks but a serious photographer looking for a small camera would be better served by a XZ-1 with its 1.8 - 2.5. Or get a D3100/T3(i) if excellent photos are what you're after.Unfortunately, the modest improvements (if any) Canon trend appears to have continued with the S100.

cameras,Difficult to Use,Music Lover,R34VD2UDGT7WBL,3,"I received this camera as a gift. Although it is a nice camera, it was not what I was looking for. I wanted a true ""point and shoot"" camera. And this camera is not really that. It is bulkier than many other point and shoots and is considerably heavier than my last camera (a Casio Exilim). Unless you are shooting in Auto mode, I find it hard to use. There are a lot of controls that are hidden within other areas. I spent more than 20 minutes trying to figure out where the black and white picture feature was. It takes good pictures, but if just shooting on ""auto"" mode, I do not find the pictures so amazing that it is worth the price tag.I also want to add that I absolutely HATE the flash feature. Whoever made this camera, should not have had the flash pop out the way that it does. There are so many times where my figure is covering the flash, because that is the natural place for someone to put their finger when taking a picture. So this is a huge issue for me. Especially when giving someone else the camera to take a picture. I wish that they made the camera a little larger so the flash could be included in the design.Maybe I am biased because this is not the camera that I had wanted, but so far I am not impressed with the value for the money.","January 5, 2012",
cameras,"Disappointed, but Optimistic",G. Guarnere,R3FBJLY82GNKMY,3,"I love Canons. They're the only brand I will look at when purchasing digital cameras. I have a Rebel, but purchased this S96 to replace my trusty SD800 (that I've had for YEARS).Out of the box, I was highly disappointed. The camera has a VERY cheap feel to it, and there wasn't even a basic memory card with which to test out the camera. Luckily, I always have an extra one in my purse, so I popped it in and set to work.Clarity is impressive (most important part, right?). The photos seem crisp and the colors are true. The menu options (as many other posters have opined) really are quite intuitive. I wasn't so happy about the facial recognition, though, as it has failed to pick up on a face or two that should have been glaringly obvious.I dunno... I have to admit being worried about the durability of this camera. The shell seems to be so... cheap. I don't spike my cameras onto concrete, but considering I've got a toddler, my cameras certainly take their bumps. I sincerely hope this one is up to the task of providing exceptional pictures while enduring the occasional bump to the case.Update: Two of the pixels were burned out and had to send back to Amazon for replacement. Amazon's service is AMAZING! In the meantime, tested out the camera some more and here's what I've got:Movie quality - Impressive. Sound quality leaves something to be desired if you're not incredibly close to the camera, but the video quality itself is astounding. Even up on a big-screen, playback is incredible. It rivals my hand-held Mini DV. I am absolutely floored by the clarity and smoothness of this function!Flash - works well if a little slow at times. Remember if you're using auto to make sure the flash is already up and out of the camera before attempting to do your work! It takes time to slide itself out of the case.Exposure - you can change this pretty quickly if you're into it. Otherwise, stick with auto which also works spot-on.Red-eye Reduction - doesn't seem to work as well as my Canon SD800. That surprised me a bit, and I'm wondering if that had anything to do with the particular camera I got. I'll be double checking this when the new one comes in.ISO - Where's the ISO button??? No ISO button makes me a sad, sad photographer. Also no selectable auto-focus point. That made me bummed, too.Outside ""shell"" or casing - I'm still not happy about this, because it honestly feels very cheap.Still, picture clarity is downright gorgeous. I cannot argue with a camera that is capable of taking such stunning photographs. The price and size of this camera blow its competitors out of the water.","December 7, 2011",

Also, there is no manual control while shooting video.-Lens: not exceptionally wide; not exceptionally long - this rules out shooting in small rooms and zooming into subjects more than 10ft away from you. Lame. Also, keep in mind that when you zoom with this camera, you lose the f/2.0 aperture; it becomes pinched down to, I believe, f/4.9. This is not unique to pont-and-shoot zoom lensed cameras, but it is something to consider.-The protruding lens ring makes it slightly awkward to find a decent (and affordable) carrying case.-No bulb exposure mode!?-Highest ISO settings are saved at a mere 2.5 megapixels, and user has no manual control such as white balance, etc. while taking the photo (here I'm refering to low-light mode).","December 5, 2011",

Low Light is better than Panasonic but still poorer than a 3 year old DSLR.This camera is good in all ways except the pictures are ordinary/mediocre.

Just get a used DSLR for under $300 and those $120 cameras for those portable needs.Don't expect money to beat the laws of physics...for Low Light pics and moving subjects you need a big area to capture light.

Obviously, I purchased the S95 when the price dropped. Unfortunately the problems I've encountered (which oddly aren't showing up for others) are unacceptable. My issue can be seen by searching ""s95 defective lcd"" on youtube.. it's the first video. I received 1 replacement and the issue was worse than the original S95.

I made it clear that this ""was"" the camera I've chosen to be my P&S;, but they replied with an email stating that they were not going to send anymore replacements. I've been directed to return it for a refund. They did send the replacement with overnight delivery, so props for that.The camera itself seems pretty nice. The few photos I took seemed on par with the S90. Though, switching from different modes seemed sluggish compared to the S90.

When intentionally overloaded by myself on continous shots, it will clear the buffer very fast(ADL on if you're wondering). Image sensitivity at high ISO is great acording to random reviwes, but I'm still waiting a prof test. But think about it, on Auto ISO the range goes to 3200 - WOW, and I can't see any noise. You can shoot everything with it, but you need a flash - SB 400 will do.Cool stuf:You can take photos from the liveview LCD screen. I shot a few movies and seem great, in focus most of the time. I don't care much about video, I have a video camera HD.You can still set AUTO ISO from the menu and set minimum shutter speed. Downside is you cannot override the AUTO ISO in any mode including Manual. You have to change it back to off from menu and than loose time figuring out which is the best ISO/aperture/shutter speed.For shortcomings, I have to look hard but here they are:(BTW I've been using it daily for 1 week)1. LCD sceen has a lower resolution and one cannot see if the foto taken is slightly out of focus - bummer, but they have to save some features for the D5100.2. No bracketing - who brackets anymore? 3 pics of each just to be 100% sure seems a waste of memory card and time (deleting the other2. We are talking about exposure bracketing, not focus bracketing BTW.)3. ADL only on or off - lol, if you really are worried about small shadows and highlits you can always add more ADL from the retouch menu in the camera, after you take the photo. Or on photoshop or iPhoto etc. On is plenty for the prosumer ;)4. Easy to get image out of focus: one can change the focus point from the screen by pressing the arrows from the OK ring. You use the OK ring a lot and if the LCD screen has returned to ready to shoot position and you press the ring one more time(goof) the image now focuses to the right/left/up/down depending on what you pressed. Combined with a low resolution LCD in the hands of a beginer = out of focus images. Just pay attention.I'm still waiting for standard high ISO tests to confirm my love for this camera. Best camera for travelers, no questions. If you want more get ready to bend your neck hauling close to 2 lbs of gear. Not me. BTW buy the 35mm 1.8 lens for low light/no flash IT BLOWS YOUR MIND.*Update 1 year later:I downgraded the rating from 5 to 3 stars. I have beed using my camera for one year now and I wanted to sell it.1. Unknown to us initially there is an problem with the sensor's software: it overexposes the pictures frecvently on auto ISO, especially in difficult light situations with high contrast. Nikon's response was that it is not an error but rather they changed the algorithm which calculates exposure on purpose. They wanted a good camera for low light. What happens in practice is that on Auto ISO (which most people use) the camera will push the ISO very high even in bright sun (will do 400-1600 ISO !!). Huge issue - burnt highlights - no way to recover it (maybe bracketing is missed after all: Worse off, the problem is the same with the D7100 and to a lesser degree D5100 (acording to reviews). NIKON, NIKON...Why did you change the algorithm????????? Updates to original camera software do not fix the problem - it is not considered a problem by Nikon. My next camera will be a Cannon T2i or whatever will be available from that series. It is more expensive but now it's worth it given this exposure issue. The only solution I found,a compromise, is to limit the range of auto ISO from 100 to say 200 or 400. This pretty much makes high ISOs useless and guess what ISOs your photo's will have? The max ISO you set.2. The LCD is moderately scratched and blurry from whear which adding to the low resolution - yep, hard to see if picture is in focus. I did not overuse the camera or abuse it. I am an amateur photographer and I wear it on my side (over shouder) or across - so there is allways rubbing with the clothes. And I'm not using the standard Nikon strap (which is too short for comfort and slides off your shouder) rather the smaller UP strap (which is great).I didn't want to write the upadate initailly but I felt it is my responsability not to mislead but inform everyone about what I know (which is not much).

The light weight and small size are major plus factors for the way I work. Controls are very easy to use and quit intuitive. The NEF and fine JPG combo is nice. I suppose the live view is a plus for some people. Photo quality, when the settings are correct, was excellent. Much nicer than my D70 when using the same lens.Minus: No remote, no grid lines, no bracketing, no Speedlight remote command mode for my 800 flash. Auto focus did not work with my 6 year-old 70~300 non-VR lens (but it works fine with my first generation 18~200 VR).BIG minus: Nikon has a firmware problem. If I am in Program mode and if the ISO Auto to ""On"", in dim light conditions it uses high ISO whether or not the flash is used. The auto ISO setting does not recognize the flash. Ken Rockwell pointed this out. You have to manually set the ISO when you use flash. If you use the built-in flash for fill-flash, this ISO thing will be a real issue, just as it is when the flash is your mains source of light.I don't care about the video capabilities, but the auto focus certainly does mess up the video's audio.In all, I think it's a good camera with that one serious ISO/flash flaw.","October 18, 2010",
cameras,"Great Pictures, BUT...","J. Claypool ""white buffalo""",R3SUQYBOUUFQAU,3,"I purchased a Nikon D3100 about a month ago and right out of the box I noticed the Auto (point and shoot) Mode was not taking the quality of pictures I was hoping for. The pictures looked dull and when I looked at the original file, I noticed it was from the amount of grain in the picture. The grain was drowning out the details, and almost made the picture look out of focus. It was happening whether I was indoor or outdoor, flash or no flash. I changed the camera to P, S, A & M modes, and it took extremely sharp pictures in those modes, which is what I was expecting from the camera. I sent that camera back and purchased a new one from Amazon. Same problem. Well, I have since done some research and participated in forums, and found out there is a problem with the D3100 choosing very high ISO levels in Auto Mode, no matter the setting. This is causing the grain/dull/no detailed photos. You would expect Auto Modes to take easy, great pictures in an entry level camera, most people coming from point and shoot cameras. If you want sharp pictures, you have to use P, S, A or M modes with the D3100. There, you can control the ISO manually, or use Auto ISO and choose a lower maximum ISO setting. Apparently this is a discussed firmware issue, but Nikon claimed they hadn't heard about it when I messaged them... Well, go take a look at the forums out there, it is an issue for those of us who expect quality shots in all modes. Other than the ISO firmware issue, it is a great camera, capable of very good pictures, just not in the auto point and shoot modes.","January 3, 2011",
cameras,Nikon D3100 and ISO Sensitivity in Auto Mode - You must know.,kgvenky,R33C0W0RDZEXGQ,3,"I recently purchased Nikon D3100 to replace my Nikon D60.I did research for more than a month going through all the reviews in the Internet. Generally, review on this Camera is good. I purchased this Camera for its Full HD Video capability, Live View and SD-XC (up to 64 GB) memory card compatibility.I am not a professional photographer, but have passion to photography, So, I bought this entry level D-SLR camera for better quality image than POINT-AND-SHOOT camera.I have read lot of books on D-SLR settings like ISO, F-Number, Aperture, Exposure compensation etc, in actual shooting; I end up using AUTO mode.THE PROBLEM WITH NIKON D3100 (I use with NIKON SB-600 External Flash Unit)In AUTO mode, Nikon D3100 selects only ""AUTO ISO SENSITIVITY""WITH FLASH UNIT: In indoor shooting; it selects very high ISO Sensitivity (mostly ISO 3200). So the image quality is not good. In the same condition Nikon D60, selects ISO value of 200, whereas, Nikon D3100 selects ISO 3200. I mean, the Nikon D3100 is not considering the Flash Unit and is not adjusting the ISO accordingly.WITHOUT FLASH IN CLOUDY MORNING TIME: Even in outdoor daylight shooting, Nikon D3100 uses wide variety of ISO sensitivity (100 to 1600) whereas D60 used between ISO 100 to 400, in the same lighting condition. The image quality of the D3100 is not good in AUTO mode and it is only comparable to any POINT-AND-SHOOT camera.You can check this in dpreview site; in D3100 (in pg 14 of review) photo of the reviewer taken with built-in flash has ISO 3200, whereas for D60 (in pg 21 of review)photo of the reviewer taken with built-in flash has ISO 100. In the review they have not mentioned about this, but for curiosity, I downloaded the images and checked the EXIF information.Even the reviewer in dpreview.com has not noticed this biggest flaw!!! It's actually a casual shot with built-in flash, the end result is grainy ISO 3200 picture.Also, try with PASM mode, by setting SOME max ISO value. In flash mode with Auto ISO, it sets this MAX ISO. The only option we have with camera is setting ourselves an ISO value. D3100 selects high ISO values in AUTO ISO setting and the resulting in high grain pictures, which prevents you to use this entry level D-SLR for Casual photography.I am just back from 15 days vacation, with more than 1500 pictures taken, out of which 90% taken in AUTO mode. only 3 pictures are in ISO 100. All other in ISO 400 to 1100 in daylight, and ISO - 1100 to 3200 in flash mode.If you are owner of D3100, please check / review your own photos.Nikon D3100 has biggest flaw in Auto ISO logic, which prevents you to use this entry level D-SLR for Casual photography. Also Live View and Video is not meeting expectations. My D60 is much better than D3100. I am going to sell D3100 and retain my D60. (If Nikon can fix this in firmware, I like to retain D3100, I have written to Nikon, awaiting reply)If you want to buy an entry level D-SLR Camera to use like POINT-AND-SHOOT, Nikon D3100 is NOT the ONE.(Nikon D3100 may produce excellent images with Pro Modes like P,S,A & M, but certainly not in AUTO mode)Comments added on JAN 31 2011.I explored more on this D3100 Camera. Now I am using Aperture priority in most Outdoor situations and Changing ISO values to get desired Shutter Speed. I try to keep ISO at 100, if light is not sufficient then I Change ISO to 200 or 400+, to avoid slow shutter speed. It works fine produces excellent results.","January 1, 2011",
cameras,"A very good first DSLR, but could be better.",eha1990,R400C4R3NQGBX,3,"This is my first DSLR, I upgraded from the Nikon N75 35mm to the D3100. The D3100 is built very well, it feels good in my hands even though it is pretty small compared to some other DSLRs on the market. The menus are extremely easy to navigate and adjust. The guide features are very useful and provide basic information about things. The rear LCD display is very bright and viewable in sunlight.I've only had the camera for a few days, but I can already see some of the limitations of the camera. There is a bug in the firmware that causes the Auto ISO to default to the highest ISO setting - Ken Rockwell pointed out this problem in his review of the product, my camera has this problem too. I hope that Nikon will release a firmware fix to the resolve this issue. I dislike not having a dedicated button to adjust the focal points in the viewfinder, you have to adjust the focal points in the menus on the camera. The N75 has a separate button just for adjusting the focus points on it. I also wish that the D3100 worked with the new SB-700 flash that is coming out, maybe this can be addressed in a future firmware update. There are plenty of things to like about the camera, but there are things that are missing. I don't care at all about the video capability because I don't see the point in using a camera to record a video.","October 22, 2010",
cameras,Great potential but not for families and general consumers.,Damien Margo,R3GKILW1UOBEVI,3,"For the average consumer this camera is flawed by design. While I love many things about this camera, the overall number mistakes Nikon has made with this model has caused me to want to switch to Canon. My first review was scathing but I took it down. After some more experience with the camera I am back with yet another fairly scathing review. If you are an aspiring beginner taking classes this might be a great choice. The price is amazing, and once you learn the finer points of photography this camera can be used to take some amazing pictures.The primary problem with this camera is its Auto ISO sensitivity setting. Unless you turn this off two bad things happen. First your manual ISO settings are completely ignored. Second, the camera resorts to very high ISO settings when it should not. This means if you are a casual photographer who likes to use automatic or semi-automatic modes you might be unhappy with the results. I have been in several situations where ISO 100 or 200 would have been the best choice and this silly camera resorted to 800 or higher. To its credit, the camera does a decent job at these higher ISO settings, but unfortunately these are not the settings I want. I cannot trust this camera to select an appropriate ISO setting automatically.The silver lining here is the education this camera will force onto its owners. I am finding the best way to use this camera is to disable the Auto ISO sensitivity, turn the dial to ""M"" and leave it there forever. Don't look back! The resulting experience and results are quite refreshing! Using the D3100 in this completely manual fashion reminds me of using my old Pentax K1000. I'm back to the joyful routine of selecting each and every setting manually. The only problem is that I have now ruined entire photo-shoots and missed a number of shots. Sometimes one must learn the hard way but at least I wont be making those same mistakes again. The end result is that I am becoming a much better photographer.The plastic flimsy body is a downer. On my D3100 getting the battery into the camera doesn't feel quite right. The battery remains spring loaded and sticks up out of the body. One must then force the flimsy battery cover closed after inserting the battery. Inserting and removing memory cards also has a weird feel as the card seems to get stuck and requires some extra force to remove it. The D3100's buttons are so cheap feeling its as if they are going to fall right off.So, for everyone except students and professionals I would not recommend this camera, or any Nikon. Canon is effectively obliterating Nikon in just about every way. That said the underlying guts of the D3100 have merit and should be considered, especially at this low price. The low-light performance is very impressive and the 18-55 kit lens isn't bad at all. At the end of the day the D3100 can be used to take amazing photographs if the owner manually takes control. I am taking some amazing pictures with this camera but in general I am looking forward to getting rid of my lenses and this body so I can switch to Canon.","August 15, 2011",
cameras,"Great for Beginners, but NOT for Intermediate Users",iriskw1,R7KXW9KI33TDT,3,"As the title suggested, the D3100 is an excellent camera for anyone new to DSLR photography; however, its features are insufficient for intermediate users seeking to improve their skills and techniques. The following contains the positives and the negatives:Pros (what I love about the D3100):-The lightest in the Nikon DSLR lineup (great for my small hands unlike my old D70)-High quality photos (beginners will be impressed)-Takes decent photos in low light environment (although a small external flash, SB-400 is beneficial in very dark settings)-Guide mode for beginners (assist in the learning process of aperture, WB, etc.)-1080p HD video recording (although I have not utilize this feature, I'm sure it will come handy when needed).Cons (what I hate about the D3100):-No in body autofocus motor (which implies old Nikon lens without the focusing motor mechanism must be operated manually attached to the D3100)-The D3100 requires the AF-S lenses for focusing (these type of lenses are normally $100 - $200 more expensive compared with regular lenses)-LCD screen only offers 320,000 dots of resolution (I find myself zooming the screen all the time to ensure focus were done correctly; what a headache!)-No wireless remote option (are you kidding me? WHY Nikon?)-No auto exposure bracketing, AEB, (if you want to experiment with high dynamic range for landscape photography, this is a great feature)-Small viewfinder (sometimes difficult to take photos with such small viewfinder)VERDICT:Again, this is a great camera for beginners (perfect for family photos and travel)and most will probably give this 4 - 5 starts, but if you are looking to expand your skills, lens collection and experimenting with HDR and other types of photography beyond the D3100's capability, this camera will not meet your needs. Look to purchasing the D7000 for an additional $500 (body only) or if you have not invested too much into the Nikon system, the Canon T2i offers more features for an additional $200. Perhaps not a fair comparison to the D3100 since the T2i is geared towards intermediate users, but for only $200 you get so much more - in body autofocus motor, amazing LCD, bigger viewfinder, AEB, light and small, and also takes great photos.UPDATE:I decided to keep the D3100 because of its light body. With the money I saved, I expanded my glass collections. In the next few years, I will be purchasing a better body. If you are a beginner, you can't go wrong with this lens, but if you are intermediate, you might want to check out the D90 or better yet, the new D7000.","January 6, 2011",
cameras,I would have loved to give it 5 stars,"tbean ""tbean""",R1DBQ9I2CG3TY7,3,"I bought this camera a few months ago and fell in love with it. It took very good pictures on auto, and I took a class and worked hard to learn how to use my first DSLR. Unfortunately, after 3 months the viewfinder became dark and an Error Code began flashing. Nothing worked and I took it in to my local store for repair. It has been over 4 weeks and still no camera. I sent an email to the Nikon customer support site, which promised an answer with 24 hours. No answer, so I sent another. After another 48 hours with no answer I called called a customer support number. Eventually I found out that a part had been ordered and there is no idea when it will be repaired. I aked why my emails were not anwered in 24 hours and was told that they were backed up. I expressed disappointment and dissatisfaction and received no esponse other than ""Uh Uh."" The most i got out of the representative was that he would make a note that I called.I have been kept in the dark about what was happening, have no idea when my camera will be returned, and was told that there is no policy for a loaner. The repair process is unbelievably slow. I am wondering if my particular camera is a lemon and will continue to have problems. So, if your camera works you will have a great camera at a great price. If, however, your camera breaks you will most likely be disapppointed in Nikon's customer service.It's a chance you have to decide whether to take.","December 1, 2012",

cameras,Using this for video? Beware the jello cam!,Rusty Nails,RHHXC8LBF4I6X,3,"As a bargain video shooter the D3100 sounded ideal: 24p, interchangeable lens, great image quality, manual features. But there's one problem: beware the jello cam! Jello cam--also known as rolling shutter--is when a video image wobbles and bends like jello when the camera is moved. To a certain extent it's a problem with all CMOS cameras, but this Nikon seems to be particularly jello-y. Locked-down footage looks great. Stills look great.

cameras,"Okay, but Nikon cuts some important cormers...",pettyfogger,R10D43VF71MRXG,3,"This camera is the third generation replacement for the venerable D40. It's smaller and lighter than the D40, and like the D40, comes kitted with the standard 18-55mm lens (so you can't choose the lens you might otherwise want without shelling out for the kit lens - an amateur way of presenting the camera to the buying public).For some reason, Nikon decided to eliminate the infrared remote feature (along with the wonderful and very inexpensive MD-13 wireless remote for $15.00) that's been on every Nikon DSLR camera since the D50. This may not seem all that much of a loss, but the remote feature made tripod photography (group shots where you want to be in, and, more importantly, night time shots where you don't want to touch the camera to trigger the shutter) much easier. Sure, there's a self-timer on the D3100, but that's a Mickey Mouse and anachronistic way of firing your camera. There's only an two and ten second selection on the timer, so you may miss the shot or not have enough time to get into the shot.Moreover, the depth of field button is gone. Good luck trying to see your depth of field on the small screen. Not a big thing to most photogs, but important if you're taking pix where focus or the lack of it is an intended part of the shot.The resolution from the D3100 seems no better than the older D40, which had all of the missing features mentioned above, plus a 1/500th sync on its flash, as opposed to the much less useful 1/200the on the D3100.A mediocre rehash of a once great entry level camera....","January 16, 2011",
cameras,Great camera but poor LCD screen,morphodone,R1AFCM1C7BUV1D,3,"I bought this camera as an upgrade to the Nikon D40. I took over 9000 photos with the D40 and had no problems with it. However it only had 3 focal points and on occasion I would miss shots. So I figured it was time to upgrade since the D3100 has 11 focal points.I think it would be a fine camera but after taking shots I could not tell if my photos were in focus. The LCD has 230,000 dots on a 3 inch screen and is very grainy. The D40 had 230,000 dots over 2.5 inches - which is obviously a better pixel density and I had no problems telling if my shots were focused on the wrong thing.Perhaps if I had not used the D40 for so long I would not have noticed the difference. So after about a month I sent back the D3100 and ordered the D5100 which has a much nicer screen.If you stare at retina screens all day on your phone or tablet you might want to check out a camera with a better resolution LCD like the D3200 or D5100 which are the same price currently.","February 6, 2013",
cameras,"Video looks great, but why no audio?",Sean Hogan,R1YEKXYEMJ6M5,3,"I got this for a Christmas present and I was extremely excited. I had wanted a Canon DSLR but I figured this was the next best thing. Unfortunately, for pictures I'd have been correct, but for videos I was wrong. First off, it is not very easy to focus this thing without the automatic focus on, and that doesn't focus my shots in the direct spot I want, but instead, only the center of the shot. Also, did I mention there's awful audio quality on this thing. Along with that, there is no microphone input so you kind of have to buy an external mike and use that and later sync the two together while editing.Now, when editing, syncing audio and video is a pain in the ass. The camera is not at all a bad camera, but if you were thinking about getting it for moderate or serious video, I advise against it.","May 14, 2014",
cameras,Highly recommended but...,Hector,R2A76NBW2OEGBJ,3,"I bought this d3100 body + kit lens one year ago, since I got it, I've been learning a lot about photography and I never felt limited by this body. I couldn't really understand why I would *need* more. After I bought the awesome Nikkor 35mm f1.8 prime lens I really knew that this was the best camera to get into photography.If you buy this however, you will eventually face two problems. The first, you have to buy new lenses, this is a dSLR and if you want to make it up for the price, the size and the weight, you have to find lenses that will make the difference. I'm talking about the difference between an entry-level dSLR and a bridge or even a Lumix with their nice leica lens and manual controls. This comes at an additional cost, you have to carry and pay the new lenses, the more you get into photography, the more you realize you NEED things like a new bag, a tripod, an external flash, etc. And we arrive to our second problem; At that moment, you will feel that you NEED this new Full Frame dSLR (in my case the d800), and you will find yourself stuck with incompatible lenses and a huge amount of money wasted.So, I feel that the more money I invest while sticking with the d3100, the more I waste money.Entry level dSLR are very limited:- In manual controls: fewer manual switches. This is not a problem for me as I find the software very handy.- In quality lenses: go for a prime or find out most lenses have serious flaws or are as expensive as a Full Frame dSLR- In response time: burst speed, shutter delay- In image quality: cropped sensorMoreover, they are quite bulky.The best camera is the one you always have on you. I would go back and buy a compact camera if I could, some models present the same controls as dSLR and are really impressive. I think the best option would be to have a really performant point and shoot, learn with it, and then buy a FX to really enjoy photography at the highest level.I took several good pictures with it last year, many critics (on /p/ board) praised me for some technical wise shot while acknowledging that DX are really bad. I could indeed see, with time, that a lot of pictures could be stunning, and after looking a while I saw that Full Frame dSLR can give me that. The same way as I thought any dSLR could give me a professional image quality over any point and shoot.To summarize, this is overpriced for a camera, buy a point and shoot to begin, you can learn as much on some of them and get amazing quality. The screen is really bad, it's really depressing to see that the quality of my photos look terrible on the screen compared to, say, the last coolpix from Nikon. If you think dSLR are just better, you are wrong, it just gives you the possibility of changing lenses and if you really want amazing capabilities, an entry-level like the d3100 will not give you anything like that.Now, if you reached this point and still feel the d3100 might be good for you, you should get it. The sensor might be important, and on a DX you will not get anymore quality as on the latest mirror-less camera. But the lens makes all the difference, if you are ready to invest in a few lenses and strongly feel you won't go the FX way that soon. I cannot but recommend getting this camera. It is very cheap for what it is, awesome lenses are available that will amaze you when looking at the resulting pictures. I did some comparison tests when I got my new lens, it really is like day and night, the kit lens should be viewed as a cheap versatile lens that lets you experiment and find out what you really want to do. Sports ? Buy a fast lens. Wild life ? Buy a long focal length lens. Portraits ? Wide aperture and a focal length slightly above the normal range. Etc. And in every category, the results will amaze you. THIS is the whole point of getting the d3100. Enjoying technical photography, understanding your hardware and produce amzing results.With a point and shoot you won't get that, it's just not specific enough and customizable enough. Sure a dSLR is huge, but the d3100 is quite light compared to other DX available on the market.If you cannot afford a FX camera or don't ever want to invest thousands of dollars in photography lenses and gears, I can't recommend more the d3100. If you ever find yourself sticking to this camera, get a point and shoot that you always carry with you as well, this is not an everyday camera at all. You will have to learn a lot about lenses and the technical aspect of photography, else you are a hipster looking to show off with an overpriced piece of gear that you don't understand and I'd strongly suggest you don't waste your money on it.This review is messed up, I just wrote it one shot and I don't expect people to like it, however I hope it will help people who are new to photography understand what dSLR are really about and if they really should get one because they saw the advertisement on TV.","May 9, 2012",
cameras,"Pretty Good, but a couple of ""gotchas"" to watch out for",Beach Bum 80538,ROQ5VFQ744EPE,3,"Decent camera BUT the USB data transfer poet is NOT a standard micro-USB connection, so you have to but the cable separately. Amazon, in it's infinite wisdom, gives you a free bag and a free memory card, but not the frigging cable. The system spec lists micro-USB, but does NOT mention the cable is proprietary. Just like Apple with chargers, you need a separate cable for everything, and Nikon gets another $8 from every camera....cheesy for a $500 product.When shooting multiple shots the buffer is often very slow. It will take 2-3 images, sometimes 4, then stop in the middle of the action you are trying to shoot.These issues aside, I feel that I got a pretty good deal for the money. The interface is relatively intuitive, and the capabilities and features are plentiful.","December 15, 2013",

cameras,Good entry-level DSLR,JSB,R37XL6WZ594IL,3,"Before this camera, I used a Nikon Coolpix L1 and was not serious about Photography. As I decided to venture into photography, I started looking for newly launched cameras in 2010 and 2011. I decided to keep the search simple at entry level DSLR as I did not want a complex unit to operate as I learn. I found D3100 a very good option at the time as compared to Canon T2i and D5000.I bought this in Feb-2011 on the President's Day weekend in good sale price. I am thoroughly enjoying this DSLR from Nikon(first one for me). Pictures are neat and clean, ease of use is also simple. Works great with 18-55mm VR. Camera size is not much bulky, though I wish they could have sold this with 18-105mm VR combination like they do in the UK.What I did not like of this camera was the Auto-ISO logic on the Auto option when flash is used. Too much of liberty has been taken away. Viewfinder does not have the ISO reading being in use for the exposure is one thing missing. Viewfinder is easily susceptible to dust particles. Some regular menu options are too much in depth inside and they could have given some rings or options on the body (like D90).What this camera lacks is the drive motor. Hence, collecting lenses is restricted as all AF-S DX lenses are costly.External flash guns available from Nikon or other manufacturer's will not sync above 1/200 or 1/250. This is a drawback to some extent on Nikon entry level DSLR bodies whereas the older D40 did much better with 1/500. The High Speed Sync option is not available in this entry level models.I have'nt used the Guide Mode and wont use as its time consuming and lengthy. Nikon would have been much better by providing some other useful options other than such Guide Mode.I did observe some sharpness issues sometimes, partly because inability to lock focus exactly. Incidentally, the focus selector lock switch is absent on this camera. Higher level Nikon DSLRs like D7000 have the focus selector lock switch.In all, Nikon took away too many ""must-haves"" of a DSLR in the name of entry level.","August 29, 2011",

cameras,"Nikon D3100 compared to Canon T3i, Sony A3000, and Olympus E-PL1",Richard Goulmassian,R17SPINIKZ0XRB,3,"I have come to the conclusion that most of the reviewers of this camera do not own any other cameras with which to make a competent and accurate comparison! Unless you are looking at a review from a professional site that does nothing but camera reviews, most consumer reviews have to be taken with a grain of salt! You have to keep in mind that for a review to have meaning, you must know what camera(s) the consumer is comparing the D3100 to and if the photos are being taken under similar conditions. Comparing the D3100 to a 6MP Canon is useless and so is comparing photos that are shot under different lighting conditions or using different ISO settings or different lenses (zoom versus wide angle).I am not going to go into all of the details as to which camera has what features since my primary concern is picture quality followed by video quality. Features are great but would rather have fewer features but better photos and videos!I took all four cameras, put them on a tripod and shot photos using the standard 18-55mm kit lens that came bundled with the camera. I took photos of a house on the side of a hill that is located about 500 yards away and then enlarged the resulting JPEG files on my computer using a 23"" HP LCD screen. I did not print them out but viewed them at 200-300% to check out every bit of detail. I used ISO speed from 100 to 3200 to get an idea of how well the noise reduction worked on each camera without sacrificing image quality,RESULTS: The best camera from ISO 100 to 1600 - Sony A3000. The second best - Canon T3i ( not as good as the Sony from ISO 100-1600, but just a little better than the Sony at 3200), third place goes to to the Olympus E-PL1 which did very well when you consider that it has a 12mp sensor versus the others that range from 14.2MP to 20.1MP. In LAST place is the Nikon D3100.The D3100 is better than my old Nikon D40x for sure but not as good as any of the other cameras I used in this comparison. You could say that it is not fair since the Nikon has 14.2MP and the others that rated better have 18-20MP. But then, the Olympus with 12.3MP also did better than the D3100!In terms of Video quality, the Canon T3i and Sony A3000 are pretty close with the T3i being slightly better. The Olympus PL1 fell to last place because the output is in 720p when all the others are 1080p. Nikon D3100 took third place in video quality.Hope that helps a little in clearing up some of the picture quality issues between at least this batch of cameras.","February 15, 2014",

cameras,Not a good camera for the money.,"James Monaco ""Multimedia Production Specialist""",R3S2QS57U7GBYM,3,"As a beginner DSLR, this camera definitely takes a good quality image with strong colors, and is quite affordable. If it's your first SLR, it is a great introduction.I began with Nikon's D40 and moved to this when the size limitations of a 6 MP image became a hindrance to my expanding photography (and print) interests. Given that this model is newer by several years, I expected improvements across the board, but this was not the case.Things I was surprised to see lacking in the features list:Bracketing--an easy feature to implement, not included on this cameraVideography--now becoming a standard on SLR still cameras, this one supports full 1080p video, but only for 10 minute clips. 10 minutes is plenty of time for taking a quick video at a family gathering or vacation, but the limit gets in the way of experimenting with more serious work. The limitation is silly, and removes this camera from practical commercial use.Remote camera control--not the rf trigger; it supports that. I mean shooting tethered for things like stop-motion photography work. Every single Nikon SLR camera (including the old D40) supports this feature, except the D3000 and D3100.Things I was unpleasantly surprised by when shooting:The Auto mode on this camera does not perform as well as the old D40. I found that photos taken on auto were very frequently less saturated and closer to blown out or plugged than I am accustomed to. Setting the camera manually gave me great results.The camera's choice in ISO is ludicrous. Outdoors, noontime, in full sunlight, at 55mm, F5.6, the camera handed me ISO 2200. It very consistently strove to ramp up the ISO to unnecessary levels, favoring sensitivity over shutter speed.The noise. Partly because of the tendency to bump the ISO higher, but in general, I found that every one of the thousands of frames I've shot so far in *every* lighting condition, has a lot of noise. Perhaps this is a product of the 14 MP sensor, compared to the 6 I am used to...but it is a severe chore to set everything manually every frame or clean up all of the noise in post. (Noise reduction has been turned on throughout)So, to sum up: The D3100 has all of the basic SLR functions, none of the advanced ones, creates bland looking photos 70% of the time on auto, and is capable of taking great looking pictures but is noisy. If you're looking for a first SLR camera, the price is right, and it's definitely a camera that can be reasoned with. But as an upgrade to a camera that did everything well but was showing its age? Not an adequate replacement.","December 12, 2011",
cameras,OK - But I want a smaller less noisy camera with better video,Sharon Lutz,R1QB1E31OO94ZF,3,"PROS:It's a good photo camera and takes great low light photos without a flash.Has lots of manual controls easily accessable with buttons and knobs rather than menu driven choices.CONS:It's big and heavy. If you are use to a SLR then perhaps this doesn't matter to you. But if you are like me, wanting a better digital camera with good low light capabilities, you'll be shocked at the size and bulk.I don't like that you have to flip a switch to get to the screen to take pictures. I'm use to using a screen as a viewfinder and like it better because it works better with glasses than having to look into a little view finder.It does not focus as well in the screen viewfinder mode as it does when you use the built in viewfind. I've tried comparing the two in numerous lighting situations and get similar results but is worse in low light settings.It is noisy as the mirror flips around. Again SLR people will not notice this but I do and this makes it difficult to be discreet at a concert or somewhere that is very quite when taking the photo.A real big show stopper for me was the fact that it does not do 30 frames per second in the video mode at 1080p resulution. It only does 24 FPS. You have to drop down to 720p to get 30 FPS. This is unacceptable to me as to why a camera loaded with this much technology cannot do at least 30 FPS at 1080p.This was a christmas gift and I liked playing with the camera for a couple of weeks to evaluate it. Like I said it's a good camera for SLR people wanting to switch from film to digital and you don't mind shooting videos at 720 p, but it's going back. I plan on purchasing the Sony NEX-5R with a pancake lense in it's place. It will cost a couple hundred more but do exactly what I want it to do at less than half the weight and bulk.","January 6, 2013",

I love the camera and have been able to have fun with some of the features that are not on the point and shoot cameras. The only reason I am giving it a 3 is because I just tried some new lenses and found out the hard way that the camera does not have auto focus. The auto focus is built into the lense. I re-read the section about which lenses are compatible and it does say that the camera does not take any lenses that do not have a built in auto focus, but I missed it at the time.I just wanted to get the word out as it could add costs in the future.","March 26, 2012",
cameras,Not-So Professional Looking Camera,Ly Hoang,ROA0LSVLSA3IS,3,"I honestly bought this because it was on ""sale"" but I didn't know anything about cameras so I thought this one was okay.It's not. It's not even mentioned in reviews or something. Which leads me to think it's an okay camera but there are small point and shoot digital cameras with better MP than this one. And it's neat that I can manually adjust everything to get the right picture but to me it's kind of hassle since I'm used to point and shoot. It's good professionally starting out but for me I would find any camera besides this one more useful.It has awesome video potential but for some reason it's limit is five minutes no matter what size SD card I put in. Could be to keep it from overheating but it's still annoying when I want to record something.And then the lens itself is small, so definitely don't expect to zoom in, might as well get a telescopic (or whatever it's called) lens. Because why would I want a camera that can only zoom so far? I might as well just get any other normal camera!

I tried using other auto focus lenses with this camera and they do not auto focus unless they are newer. I am returning this item and going to get the D7000 instead so I have more control over the options I mentioned above, yes it is more money but I guess you get what you pay for as far as features go. I will say I would recommend this to someone, but that also depends on if you want to do most everything in automatic modes witch does give you great pictures, however if you want to learn photography I would not recommend this it's a pain to go into and out of menus and flip this switch or that switch to get into different settings.

cameras,Open Your Eyes!,"S. Normand ""Scotcher""",R38NBWH6UZ28XJ,3,"It is easy to get tunnel vision with all these glowing reviews on Amazon. However, this camera really doesn't have any standout features. Its the same old technology that has been around for years. You are still going to have to wait a ton of time between shots, the burst mode is slow, and the burst mode does not support focusing between shots. The view finder is not going to actually show you the picture you are going to get since it is an optical viewfinder. And the viewfinder is going to black out when you actually take the shot. Sure, all these traditional SLR cameras take great pictures, but really, what camera at this price doesn't. What are you really looking for at this price point? For me, it is fast between shots and can burst fast so I am sure to get a great shot. I hate cameras that make me wait between shots until the camera is ready to take another picture.If you want the hidden gem in the SLR camera world, check out the Sony SLT technology. It is a new technology that is much faster and allows the viewfinder and focus mechanisms to function like they should. I have the SLT-A57 and I think you can tell from the reviews that it is as good or better than any of these SLR cameras.No, I don't work for Sony. I just think that someone should point out the fact that there are other options out there and better technology available.","November 25, 2013",

Paid the difference from a Canon T3, specifically for the auto-focusing video.After I got it working (need to set it in AF-F mode), not the default discovered it can autofocus only about 50% of the time. Also, when it did you could hear the noise of the lens motor focusing in on the audio fo the video that was recorded. Very annoying. Also, not to mention that after reading the manual, you can only max out a a 10 minute video (no more!). Second, the build quality does not seem that good as compared to previous Canon's I have had. The SD card door slides open too easily, i.e. when grabbing the body and pulling it out of a camera bag. This size and weight is nice and is the smallest and most compact DSLR out there, but I found that Canon is more suited to my tasted. Not to mention the cheap looking LCD icons and the a not too intuitive ISO selection. Overall, I've decided to return it and for now stick with my Nikon P7000 with which I can't really tell the photo quality differences, but is much easier to use with all the dials.Overall: decent for the price, but if you don't care about autofocusing video, save the $50 to $100 and get the Canon t3 instead.","March 31, 2012",

For example, the camera works splendidly and takes good photos even while walking briskly or in an automobile. Why have the vibration control in the lens?

I was able to work around it, although it was painstaking. Then my son went to hand me my camera and accidentally dropped it and then it would no longer turn off.

cameras,60D flaw which Canon needs to fix,Michael Everett,R5ZYCE9SVRI1T,3,"This is a great state of the art camera with one major flaw. There appears to be a conflict between the hot shoe and the built-in flash. The hot shoe may be erroneously reporting to the built-in flash that an external flash is still mounted on the hot shoe. The bottom line is, there's no way to open the built-in flash. Google something like <canon 60D built-in flash problem> and you'll find an avalanche of 60D owners trying to figure out how to open and use their built-in flash. Many report fixing the problem by probing the tiny leaf springs beneath the hot shoe rails. I tried it, but not to vigorously because I was reluctant to possibly damage the two springs.In an email from Canon they had me run through every routine they could think of in hopes of resetting the camera. None of this worked so today I UPS'd the camera to Canon. It was $8 to ship to Canon 56 miles away and about $25 for $1100 in insurance. That's a total of $33.00 and your warranty won't cover it.Judging from various forums, the 7D has a similar problem.The 60d is a great camera, but Canon needs to wake up and pay more attention to engineering or they'll start losing market-share in DSLR's.","May 13, 2011",

cameras,Just as good as the T3,Suntoryjim,R1HF0ZGP9JNHTG,3,"I bought this camera new from Amazon. My first copy came with a dirty viewfinder and a SD card slot eject spring that was broken. I immediately sent it back to Amazon and got a replacement shipped to my door next business day (awesome service!). So my second copy came in pristine condition, except for the 346 clicks already on the shutter (according to EOScount). Are these cameras really being sold as new?Seeing that this was a replacement for my T3 (retro-grade?), I immediately went to work pixel-peeping and comparing shots. While I was not able to find any obvious variance in picture quality between the 2 cameras, I did find that pictures taken with the 60D at ISO 1600 had noticeably more noise than those taken with my T3 (using the same lens, same camera settings (on-board NR and ALO disabled), same lighting and test subject, all RAW shots taken on a tripod. Not convinced, I took 2 more test shots with different subjects and different lighting. Same results. The shots taken with the T3 were noticeably less noisy at ISO 1600. While this may not be a huge deal, considering how we have all been lectured at some point about the evils of shooting at that high an ISO, it's certainly worth noting.The truth of the matter is that for $700 less than the cost of a 60D, you can get the same, if not slightly better images (at ISO 1600) from a T3.There is no debating, however, that the 60D is a well-built camera. The shutter sound alone leaves no doubt as to its intended durability. The image quality is great...in fact, it's just as great as the less pricey, albeit plasticy T3!If you're considering a 60D, and build quality, burst rate, top panel LCD, and dedicated controls are selling points for you, then definitely buy one (like I did). On the other hand, if your main objective is to take great pictures, and you don't mind the consumer-grade interface and plasticy feel, then a T3 (or T3i, if you want more substance) will deliver the same results.","May 4, 2012",

My main complaint is that the rubber layer on the grip started to peel off after less than 2 years of what I call light use (I take the camera out about two days in a month on average).

I'm not talking about deep scratches from walls, metals etc.. I'm talking about those shallow but very annoying scratches. It's just a magnet for them scratches. I admit, I did not close the articulating screen all the time and I did walk with it open (flipped backwards). It does not change the fact the it is full of scratches from my SHIRT and my JEANS.I am pleased with the camera but it just annoys me the after only 2 days the LCD is fully scratched.. I assumed that if my 40D lasted so well (without screen protector)..I could live few days without a screen protector with my new 60D. I was wrong, now it drives me crazy.I know that I can send it to Canon for a not-too-expensive screen cover replacement but I don't live in the US and here it's not as easy to do.Another complaints worth mentioning: Removing of the joystick was a mistake and the soft button ,that aren't giving any feedback, are not amazing..Apply a screen protector or close the flipped screen after every use!!","May 14, 2013",

Sure it does HD and if you focus before you start recording the quality comes out as promised. But forget about focused videos if you want to zoom or change distance to the object while filming. It doesn't autofocus!!! You can press the shutter release half way to refocus but the autofocus struggles to regain focus for a few seconds and is noisy. And of course it records this pitiful attempt.I was hoping to replace my 8y old Panasonic miniDV video camera with this camera plus my failing point&shoot; without having to buy a still camera & a video camera again but I guess this is not it to do so. Since the T2 and T3 have the same photo quality you may go for these cheaper models (with the same major components) and buy a dedicated video camera for the savings that will do a better job than the 60D.","October 10, 2011",

The locking top wheel mode button is frustrating. The flip out screen in the back is nice and being able to turn it around to protect the screen is nice but the fact that it flips out gives me something else to break on some trek through some far off land.It's almost like Canon wanted to kill the ""Prosumer"" line and either make me an enthusiast or a professional. Sure the 60D has 18MP but if you want a more solid construction, you're going to have to go to the 7D and that's a ton more money. Sad. Truly sad that Canon has done this to this line. I hope they bring back the solid prosumer line with magnesium cases and great features. Just save your money until they fix this or just go buy a Rebel.This inconsitency is in the end the biggest issue with buying into a system like EOS. You're at the mercy of the vendor. I picked Canon because I thought I knew where they were going. I have a 20D and a ton of high end lenses and now I'm almost locked into Canon but if Canon keeps doing this to me, I'm going to put the lenses on Ebay and go with Nikon.

cameras,"Great camera for stills, Bad camera for video",Beth Disharoon,R225553MIWL8X2,3,"I take home videos of birds in the backyard, trains in the city, planes at the airfield and other natural settings where I like to switch back and forth between shooting stills and video quickly. I've long been a canon fan for the articulated screens that provide flexibility for shooting from the hip, both stills and video, although I've often found it difficult to switch between the two modes. I'm new to the DSLR world, and recently upgraded to the 60d from the Canon G12 for the purpose of gaining variable lenses to shoot video at the fraction of a cost for a decent video camera with comparable lens. I've owned the 60d for two weeks now, and have found the transition to zoom lenses relatively easy, and there's an obvious improvement to image quality for both stills and video. Since my use is primarily video, here's my initial reactions to utilizing the camera, while occasionally taking stills and primarily shooting video.Pros: Clear and crisp stills. Easy to understand menus and buttons that are similar to the G12 and most Canon point-and-shoots. Big articulated screen that folds away nicely when not in use, or opening wide when needed. The 60d takes SD cards, which are more portable and commonplace than Flash cards. The battery life is much longer than the Rebel. No real advantage for shooting video by upgrading to a full frame camera, so this is a relatively inexpensive DSLR. Canon 60d has more megapixels than the nikon d7000.Cons: For video the Nikon D7000 is better. Hands down. I understand the Nikon D7000 does real-time auto focus (although it is loud), the 60d does not. For switching between stills and video, the Nikon D7000 has a quick ""jump to video mode"" switch accessible to the right thumb, while the 60d requires the user to unlock the scene selector dial and scroll to video mode with the left hand requiring an extra 5 seconds of visual inspection and transition. Without this ""jump to video mode"" feature on the 60d, I must move the camera to visualize the dial and completely lose aim on my subject.Conclusion: I didn't do my homework before buying the 60d for my video needs. If you're looking for a fast transition between stills and video, or you want auto-focus for video, then I'd pay the extra 200 bucks for the Nikon D7000. I'm invested in the Canon lenses already, so I'll have to wait for the next innovation from Canon to catch up with the superior video features already offered by Nikon.","March 29, 2011",
cameras,Lack of microfocus adjust (MFA) a glaring omission,JB,R31C5UWMNM8RL2,3,"The Canon 60D was released as a follow on to the Canon 50D, and as part of the ""prosumer"" or ""semi-pro"" line would be expected to have higher end features not found on the Rebel line of digital SLRs. In some cases I think Canon made wise choices with the 60D - for example going to an all-plastic body (as opposed to the magnesium body of the 50D) enabled Canon to decrease the size and weight of the 60D while still having a solid tough camera.Unfortunately there is one glaring omission from the feature line of the 60D, which is called microfocus adjust (MFA). MFA allows the user to slightly calibrate the focusing of their individual lenses with the camera. In many cases MFA for a specific lens / camera combination is not needed, but occasionally the user will get much sharper pictures by setting up MFA for a specific lens / camera combo. For instance with my current Canon 7D most of my lenses require little or no MFA, but one requires a fairly large adjustment of -7 to function optimally.With the 60D, users may find the certain lenses just don't producer sharp pictures. And without MFA, the user is unable to find out if a simple MFA adjustment would correct the problem. As such, I'm not impressed with the 60D as a prosumer / semipro camera. If you just want a nice DSLR you can save money and get a Canon EOS REBEL T4i 18.0 MP CMOS Digital Camera with 3-inch Touchscreen and Full HD Movie Mode (Body Only). If you want a true prosumer DSLR you best bet at the moment is to actually get a used Canon 50D or upgrade to the Canon EOS 7D 18 MP CMOS Digital SLR Camera with 3-Inch LCD (Body Only).Note: the 60D's price has dropped dramatically recently, making it an easy choice over the t4i.

I like the articulating LCD screen but it felt flimsy at the hinge. I don't like the dual dial controls. I would have rather seen the thumb wheel control the vertical scroll and the larger back wheel control the horizontal scroll. Granted all the design quirks are issues most could get used to but after shooting with the MK III for the past four years, it just felt odd.Image quality was good, if not exceptionally good. No complaints there.Seeing this is a back-up camera, I've decided to return it and looking into the smaller Rebel T3i to save a little money. Either that or a used 40D (better build quality).

So far it has been a blast although it is quite heavier than the Canon T1i. My one and only gripe, which is the poorly designed controls. I dont usually write reviews and complain about anything, but with the amount of money I paid for this, I felt the need to air out my frustrations over this product. It takes two hands to operate this camera, compared to the T1i which was a dream to handle. Power button and mode dial on the L, menu/shutter buttons on the right. It seems I continue to struggle and twist my hands just to operate the 60D. Its a control geography nightmare that resembles the earlier netbooks with the mess up shift key(for those who can relate). There is just no excuse for that kind of design mishap. I sure wish Canon consulted photographers before designing this because, its bothering me more than i thought it would. Unfortunately, I would have to endure it for now. The T2i, which is a lower model, would have been a better choice. Or the 7D, if you could afford it. Just be aware of this major flaw before purchasing. The 18-200mm lens is not perfect but I am happy I get to lessen my lens changing. I do miss the extra 50mm from my old lens. Maybe they would create a 18-300mm, that would really be something for us photographers who get lazy to switch lenses. This is sort of my last Canon upgrade for awhile, and will evaluate later on if maybe a Nikon move would be a better avenue for my hobbies.","December 30, 2010",

Exact same rubber/plastic.-The Q button vs wheels is negligible.-The extra weight and size are NOT a bonus. Equipment being light is a bonus, not a negative. The argument that ""it feels better in my hands"" is bogus. Add a few battery grips and a 10lb dumbbell if you really want more weight. You should be using a rig or tripod for stability, not camera weight.-The sensor is virtually identical the same as is the interface.The top LCD isn't terribly useful, especially if you mount an LCD viewfinder.-This camera is MUCH heavier yet adds nothing. If you want more battery life, buy a few $20 batteries from amazon.-The max 1/8000 exposure time and 5.7fps rate are minor advantages over the 600D.

Noticeble distortion begin to appear near the center focus at 28 mm and worsens when widening to 18mm.I did a quick seach on the web for 60D distortion, CNET has a review reporting same issue with unkind comments:[...]The reviewer used a statue which for an untrained eye is very difficult torecognize and appreciate the distortion. In my case, I used vertical blinds as test object.At ISO less than 400, a $1200 DSLR should be prefect in every shot.

cameras,Another one with focus problems,Mikey likes it,R39Q6GYZJQL9VV,3,"I had a D5100 and exchanged it for the D7000, which was back focusing, making many images (especially those at close range) soft. If the D7000 focused precisely out of the box, as it's supposed to, I would have kept it, since I liked all of the other features it has. All of my photos from the D5100 were sharp using the same lenses, so the lenses weren't the problem. I tried AF fine tuning and it helped a little, but not enough, even after reaching the maximum adjustment factor. A camera at this price level should have better quality control. Sure there are manufacturing tolerances, but they should be able to get the most critical assemblies close enough so the camera at least focuses properly, rather than hoping that customers won't notice or requiring them to spend hours fine tuning the AF, sometimes to no avail. It seems like getting a good D7000 depends quite a bit on luck. I've yet to decide if I'll try another D7000 or if I'll just go back to a D5100.The D7000 also overexposes in bright/high contrast situations when using matrix metering, causing highlights to be clipped and detail to be lost. Some say that this is just the advanced metering system working as intended. Perhaps, but it requires the user to use negative exposure compensation whenever a shot like this is taken (or to program it into one of the ""U"" settings). You don't always have time to do this when a a good photo op comes around. IMHO, this is a significant flaw that should be corrected via a firmware update.BTW, some have stated that the D7000 has better IQ than the D5100. All reviews I've read state that they are exactly the same in IQ, or that the diff is so small that it's negligible. This is consistent with my experience. In certain situations, like sports and low-light fast motion shots, the D7000's better AF and metering might help produce better photos, but for everything else, they're pretty much the same.UPDATE: I decided to give the D7000 another chance and ordered a second one. Same backfocusing problem. This time, adjusting the AF fine tuning by a factor of -4 for all of my lenses results in sharp focus, but using AF fine tuning isn't an ideal solution, since it causes the camera to not focus properly at infinity or at minimum focusing distance. Depending on the degree of AF tuning required, this could then require the user to manually adjust the focus ring after the AF has ""reached its limit"" (the limit which has changed due to the use of AF fine tuning). Another unnecessary hassle you need to remember to take care of. The AF fine tuning feature is nice to have, but its purpose is to dial-in lenses that are a bit off due to manufacturing tolerance. I don't think it was intended to adjust a faulty body to work with lenses that are in spec, but that's the way it's often being used.For anyone who buys a D7000, I'd recommend doing a focus test as soon as you get it, to ensure that you're getting the IQ you paid for. The best way to do this is with a focus test chart, but a quick and dirty method is to tape a page of text on the wall (make sure it's totally flat against the wall). Then, mount your camera on a tripod perpindicular to the wall, with lens (set at the largest aperture) at the same height as the page. Take a shot or two using autofocus through the viewfinder. Use the remote or self timer, with mirror lockup. Then take some shots using live view. If the AF photos are not as sharp as the LV shots (or at least very close to them in sharpness), your AF is off (most likely back focusing).","July 11, 2011",
cameras,Great Camera - Questionable quality control from Nikon,"Anupam Trivedi ""Aviator""",R1WUDIGOORB7BA,3,"Firstly, I have to say that I am very impressed with Amazon's customer service.I have been buying from Amazon for several years, but never had to call customer service or return anything until my D7000 purchase. I am very impressed with the ease and transparency of the return process. This is what all online retailers should strive to achieve.Background - I've used a D90 with a Nikon 18-200 lens extensively, and found the results to be excellent.Now regarding the D7000.I purchased the D7000 body with a Nikon 18-200 lens. As soon as I began to take pictures I noticed that the focus was a bit off and the colors seem to appear washed out and bland. I tried the camera in bright sunlight, indoors - low light, room lighting, flash etc, nothing seemed to help. I read the manual from cover to cover, and for the longest time, I assumed that I was doing something wrong. For about 2 weeks, I systematically changed and reset various controls, sharpness settings, white balance etc nothing seemed to help. Finally began to search the online reviews and forums, and found that this seemed to be a problem with certain units and it seems that Nikon has been slipping on quality control.Incidentally, I came upon a Wolf Camera store while traveling through Sarasota FL and had a chance to speak with the sales people and play with the display until in the shop. I immediately realized that I had a bad until, and my experience was not necessarily a problem with D7000 model in general.I returned bad D7000 to Amazon and purchased another D7000. This second unit performs flawlessly. I am very impressed with the camera and features. Exploring and learning to use all the capabilities will be journey.","November 10, 2011",
cameras,"Excellent photo, frustrating video, bad service","Robert Ward ""Bob""",RHFRF70LQDBI3,3,"Pros:Performance in low light is superb.Build quality is as good as professional level DSLRs.Custom mode dial is very useful.Small changes in layout from D90 are great.Infrared thingy on the back makes using the remote easier.Cons:Video auto-focusing is a marketing gimmick and just does not work in real world situations. In addition, the mic picks up the AF sounds and it is very loud. You would have to use a mic off-camera. I even bought an on-camera directional mic, but it still picks up the sounds to the point of being useless. But the audio issue is a moot point really, as the video AF is of little use. Nikon should focus on competing with Canon for video market share by matching Canon's bitrate and framerate levels rather than by touting video AF. Pros don't use video AF anyway.!!! The lack of a recording indicator light on the front and little indication on the back means you will have no idea when the 20 minute recording limit is reached when using it on a tripod without someone behind the camera. If you are planning to use the D7000 to record family gatherings, you are going to be frustrated and disappointed. I actually missed the first laugh of my infant son because I thought it was recording, but it wasn't! A simple light and a beep when it is done seems like a complete no-brainer and I can't imagine why Nikon did not include this feature on this or the D7000.Included software is not very good. Okay, Nikon's software sucks. It is a complete mystery how they rationalize charging $200 for a half-baked remote capture application (Camera Control Pro), when Canon includes something better for free! I scratch my head a lot when thinking about Nikon's strategies.Check your camera for backfocusing before the return period ends! This is widely reported, but Nikon has not owned up to it. I had to send mine in for service for a severe backfocusing problem. The entire service experience ranks up there with my Worst Nightmare Experiences Ever. Nikon's Customer Service is bad, bad, bad- infamously so. I won't go into the details here, but let's just say I came very close to selling my Nikon gear at a loss to switch to Canon. But they just make such darn great cameras!Final Analysis:The best prosumer DSLR Nikon has ever made. It's class performance is second to none. Video looks great but is frustrating to use without an indicator light. Backfocusing problems should be checked for right away. If this is your first camera and you are considering the Nikon/Canon question, ask yourself how important customer service is to you. Canon=good, Nikon=bad.","January 23, 2012",
cameras,"great still camera, but not fully usable as a video camera",Phillip M. Feldman,R2AV2MEOODRAO6,3,"- As a still camera, this is a wonderful piece of equipment, and I have no complaints.- As a video camera, the D7000 is a continuing source of frustration to me. Key issues are the following:(1) The 20-minute recording limit is a major limitation. This should be increased to the capacity of the card, or at least to 60 minutes.(2) The camera has several microphone sensitivity modes. One of these sets the level automatically, which would be very convenient if it worked. The problem with this mode is that the camera tends to set the sensitivity too high, producing saturation and distortion.(3) When one uses the internal microphone, there is a fairly high level of noise from the auto-focus.(4) When one uses a monaural external microphone, the camera should reproduce the input in both channels, but does not (one channel remains empty).(5) When using an external microphone and a mixing board to reproduce the signal in both channels, there is intermittent electrical noise. (The volume of the noise is high enough to impact the intelligibility of spoken audio, i.e., this is not just an issue for music recordings). I don't hear the noise if I plug headphones directly into the mixing board, and that same output is being fed to the camera, so it's fairly clear that the noise is being generated by the camera itself.To summarize, this is a great still camera, but not fully usable as a video camera.","May 26, 2012",

Luker ""Johhny Bravo""",R3FFQXR5CAI6KR,3,"I have had the Nikon D7000 for 2 months now and this is my 4th Nikon DSLR over the past 8 years. As I have invested thousands of US dollars in Nikon lenses I am married to the Nikon System. My previous Nikon was a D90 that was stolen New Year's Day, with the recent price drop due to the D7100 coming I took the opportunity to get the D7000. The extra $450 US I saved allowed me to get a Nikon 24mm f/2.8D lens and Meike vertical grip as well as a generic wired remote cable, all for the price of the body only D7100.If you are reading this you are in one of two camps, a current Nikon owner looking to upgrade current DSLR or someone looking to get into digital photography for the first time/getting a gift for someone else. If you are a current Nikon owner you know most of the features and advances the D7000 offers. For you the question is if the price difference between this and the D7100 is worth it. The first run of D7000 was plagued by oil splatter on the image sensor and quality control issues with the AF system. My D7000 bought in January 2013 had all the current firmware installed right out of the box but had a serious back focus issue. I took it into Nikon for repair and they fixed it in 20 minutes with a software upload. I am sure the first run of the D7100 will have some bugs to be worked out and reviewers are just starting to get their D7100's now. The D7100 has many advantages but the price is still high for ""entry level"" grade bodies. I personally rather save the money and use it towards lenses that will last me many future generations of camera bodies.For those looking to enter into the Nikon DSLR world or getting a gift for someone this is an excellent choice. For new users you will need to have a good basic foundation for photography and the controls needed to get great photos. This is a huge jump from point and shoots and the number, placement, and function of the controls can be overwhelming at first. If you have used 35mm film SLR cameras in the past it will be an easier translation. The D7000 has one issue needing to be known before getting. It is a high resolution and contrast camera. This requires better technique and control over the camera to get the best results. The D7000 is a serious camera and to get great pictures out of it you have to seriously use it.For those getting this for someone else the biggest thing to understand is this camera is just a piece of a larger more comprehensive system. This means there are lenses, flashes, and accessories to expand photography well beyond snapshots. The kit lenses are good for a start but the curiosity to expand into the hundreds of available lenses and accessories will soon take hold. This is an excellent camera that will serve anyone well but does require a level and degree of photography knowledge to use well. There are users who complain of image quality with this camera. Many of these are due to user error or lack of proper techniques but there is an issue with the auto focus system on some cameras. I experienced this and contacted Nikon who fixed the issue for free without any issues. I do recommend the camera but I can't rate it at 4 or 5 stars due to the AF back focus issue. For everything else this is a solid 5/5 star camera that will last for years and provide plenty of creative room to express your vision any way you like. The only real upgrade from this camera is full frame or FX format. For the most part this is academic unless you are using photography for a living. For hobbyists and people only looking to take great pictures the D7000 is the best bargain on the market at this time.","March 27, 2013",

cameras,"Audio of video needs much improvement, but picture quality is great",Sergei,R2S76KEKZDDKP4,3,"This review is specifically about audio quality when shooting video with D7000. The quality of images is great. I have been taking pictures with D7000 for 3 years and would give 5 stars for its photo capabilities and image quality. I also shot a few videos with this DSLR, and did not like the audio, especially when recording music. I know I am not going to skew the average rating of D7000 by giving it 3 stars, but I hope this will flag the review to help alter the problematic audio of this camera. As many are aware, the audio of the movie provides over half of the overall impressions of the movie.Quite a few reviewers mentioned the poor sound from the D700 that can be described as ""tiny"", not loud enough, having significant noise, and sometimes distorted (slow reacting auto gain?). It is commonly suggested to use an external microphone and place it off camera to improve the sound and eliminate the focusing noise. You can further improve the sound by connecting a directional mic first to a personal recorder which you would, in turn, connect to the D7000. The sound will still be limited by the capabilities of the D7000 recording module, which was reported to record sound in the meager, 150-5000 Hz range. Please find the link to that report by the Finnish magazine, Tekniikan Maailma (World of Technology). in the comment below this review. With this rigging, you will have an improved, although still phone-like, sound matched with the video. Capturing the sound with a quality recorder and syncing the audio with the footage in the post can ensure an ultimate adudio. I explored a few options and chose the Sennheiser MKE 600 directional mic ($330) and Sony PCM M10 portable recorder ($225-250) to improve my D7000 audio, especially when shooting video of quiet music recitals at some distance from the performer. I compared the above Sennheiser mic with 2 cheaper Bronstein shotgun microphones side by side. The former sounded pretty good even when plugged directly in the camera, and the Bronstein mics were too quiet (although I tried one of them on a Sony camcorder, and it worked well). When I am using the Sony recorder (instead of or in combination with an external mic), I connect the recorder to the camera with a 35 dB attenuation cable so the sound is not clipped in D7000. This produces a relatively good sound in-camera, and I am still getting a copy of a better audio in the recorder as an option for post processing. The direction of the attenuation cable must be observed or the sound will be ruined. A recorder's built-in omnidirectional stereo mics (instead of a shotgun) will also greatly improve the sound, but a shotgun mic will help isolate the intended sound and suppress side/back noise. To hear how the audio sounds when recorded with D7000, Sony PCM M10, Sennheiser and 2 Bronstein mics (connected to camera, or recorder, or first to recorder and then to camera), please follow the link to my YouTube video in the comment below (or search YouTube for ""Microphones compared: Sennheiser MKE 600, Bronstein BRN-900, BRN-400, Sony PCM M10, Nikon D7000"". Please note that the source sound level in that test was intentionally turned down and the mics or camera placed 10 feet away from the source to compare how they record relatively quiet sounds. The setup of this test required to increase gain on the recorder, which increased the noise levels, but the noise is still acceptable for Sony and Sennheiser. There are many shotgun microphones to choose from. After testing just a few of them, I noticed that their perfomance varied greately on D7000. I got Sennheiser after testing 3 other shotgun mics that produced low sound levels, and one mic in the review was too noisy.","May 8, 2014",

It was just quite blurry even at the focus point. 35mm has back focus issue and the image was blurry too, just a little bit better than 16mm. 70-300 is much better. I used the same lens with D300s and the picture was much sharper. I guess something wrong with D7000's focus system.

I admit to having very high hopes for the low light capabilities of this camera and in most ways it lived up to the hype, taking very usable images at iso 3200 in near darkness.I used it for about 3 months off and on for some bar photography and 2 weddings as well as just fooling around with it. In low light it focused very quickly and I was very happy with everything except especially the improved flash metering (metering in general actually, you often have to baby sit the d700 meter in tricky light if you use it). Unfortunately when I looked at the images on my computer it seemed like most of them were WAY too soft for a fast prime. I calibrated all of my lenses on it and tried my damnest to fix the issue and upgraded to the most recent issue but it still SEVERELY backfocused in about every third shot or so, just enough to keep the subject from being sharp enough. I noticed it was worse with my G series pro lenses, my old 85 1.4d seemed to nail every time though.I could have sent it into get fixed but my biggest problem with the camera was the flexability of the raw files and dynamic range at high iso's. At 3200 if it didn't nail the exposure the photo was ""difficult"" to save and the resulting image would always lose way too much detail and smooth tonal gradation. I already knew i was spoiled by the d700 but the specs said it should have been better than it was.It is a very good camera, but I agree that the focusing issues with this camera and the i guess, ""quality of the noise pattern in the raw files at high isos"" prevent it from being an acceptable backup to my D700, the D300 is still just more convenient and excellent at low iso.Things I liked:-Handling-Metering-weight and size-felt very well built-video was cool but still not good enough-dual card slots THANK YOU NIKON.Things I didn't like:-no af-on button (which sort of drives me nuts due to personal habits)-Focusing-The noise pattern at high iso (1600-3200+ w/ no NR)resembles a pointilism impressionist painting instead of the more natural film grain look from the x100 and D700 I pretty much only shoot my x100 at between 2200 and 3200 without ever having a quality issue.","December 15, 2011",
cameras,lens not working after less than a year,Loraine Braschwitz,R2TFM6AN4AQ1H,3,Bought this for my husband for Christmas last year and he loved the product. Around Thanksgiving of this year the lens wouldn't focus. Just took it to a camera shop and they said the problem is with the lens and we had to spend 400.00 on a new one.

cameras,Great Camera with a poor kit lens,7 Toed Pete,R2ZZF9ZVQFZ7T4,3,"I bought the D7000 and a Fotodiox lens adapter hoping I could use a couple of lens I have from an old SLR film camera. I knew it was a gamble with the adapter because I had read where it worked okay and others said not to waste your time. My experience was that the lenses fit the camera fine with the adapter but the picture quality left a lot to be desired. I could not use the old lenses.The D7000 is a fine camera and I found that although I had never used a Nikon or a DSLR before, I felt very comfortable with the camera and the controls after a relatively short period of time. To me, this camera is a masterpiece of photographic engineering.The kit lens, on the other hand falls way short of the camera. To put this lens on this camera is like putting some old bias ply tires on a Ferrari. You could still drive the Ferrari but you would not come close to getting out of the car what the manufacturer put into it. So it is with this camera and lens combination.If your budget is around $1,400 for a camera I would recommend buying something cheaper like the Nikon D5100 and buying a good prime lens from Tamron or find something on Ebay. There are hundreds, if not thousands, of older Nikon lenses available on Ebay.In summary, the camera is outstanding. Unless you're a pro who needs the full frame sensor have some special requirements, I would say that you couldn't do better for the price than the D7000.I reluctantly returned the camera to Amazon. Amazon's customer service was, as usual, outstanding.","November 19, 2011",
cameras,D7000..made by Pixar?,JT,R22V1UMXHJZ70D,3,"I am relatively new in DSLR technology but I've been playing with SLR cameras for over 30 years so I shouldn't say I am completely a novice when it comes to photography. And please, since this is just my personal opinion that I just want to share with others, those who already own D7000 shouldn't feel offended by my review because this is just my personal experience I had with D7000.I first bought D90 but soon switched to d7000 because I only hear good things about it.. Like many of you, I spent days after days searching for just a right camera which can take my photography skill to the next level.Anyway, to make the long story short at first I liked the camera because it takes sharp photos with nice color rendering. I was using nikkor 35mm f 1: 1.8G lens and although it's not the best lens out there it handled the low light condition pretty well. Most of the shots I took came out pretty sharp and bright with almost no noise even at 3200 ISO. However, the more I take the photos I soon began to notice there's something lacking in the pictures. They're well focused, bright, clean and vivid so what's the problem here? The problem is that my photos do not look `natural'. It almost feel as if I am looking at, sort of like photo realistic, well drawn painting or perhaps I should say, `computer animation graphic like you see in Pixar movies. (ex. Toy Story) Of course, with Photoshop tweak that problem becomes even more apparent. If you're not sure what I mean, please go to flickr.com and type D7000 and see if you can tell the difference.But D90, on the other hand, although it wasn't as 'perfect' as I thought(good though, just not perfect) at least it gaves me realistic looking photos. I saw many review clips on Youtube that compare D7000 to D300s and explain the reasons why they think D7000 is a better choice over D300s. Well, I am begining to question if those people at youtube are truthfully being objective in sharing their honest opinion, or if they were smply hired by Nikon to promote and boost sales of new D7000. From looking at the sample photos from different sites it really wasn't hard to tell D7000 and D300s are not in the same level as far as the picture quality goes. Even with heavy photoshop tweaks I still think those photos from D300s still do look like ""photos"".:Of course, the quality of lens has A LOT to do with it too. I just wish there's more acutal photo comparsion done with same lens with different bodies, or vise vesa and let the viewers come to better understanding with image quality generated by each camera/lens. Some people like vivid colors, some don't--It's very subjective matter. Just comparing the spec between cameras don't really mean much to me, as quality of photo is more important than anything else. For others, other functions like capability of full HD, High ISO, and etc are just as important as image quality. I know some guys in Youtube said image quality of D7000, when comapred to that of D300, looked ""at least"" the same or in some cases, better. In my honest opnion, that is not true. D300s is better when it comes to image quality. When I look at the details from D7000 and D300s, it's sharpness is kind of like comparing it to ""Pencil vs. 0.3 mechanical pencil.Don't get me wrong, Nikon D7000 in my opinion, is a good camera. Many people also choose D7000 because of full HD capability. I was certainly one of them. But after all, I am buying a camera, not a camcorder. I mean, taking a great looking shots certainly weighs more than multi-function camera. Again, D7000 is a good camera. D90 is good too consider it's value. But I don't think it is equivalent with D300s as some claim. I came to a conclusion: You get what you paid for.","April 15, 2011",
cameras,Impressive but flawed,NCHammer,RUB2A5MV9H7,3,"Although on paper D7000 is more advanced / has better specifications than the D90. Nikon clipped this camera's wings.Tons of D7000s are suffering from back-focusing, or hit and miss auto focusing issues. The images are out of focus frequently or systematically back focused. My D40/D3100/D90 does not have such issues.Worse still, the images at 100% are fuzzy and blurry, losing details. It's as if there is a dense fog surrounding everything in the picture, including the objects supposedly in focus.","January 12, 2012",
cameras,I agree with the comment below.,"Jimmy Le ""JL""",R19392ND1242YY,3,"Basically I was upgrading from a D5000. My friends D90 starter kit wowed me and that is what initially propelled me into photography. Anyways I eventually saved up enough and purchased the D7000 starter + 50mm 1.4 + 35mm 1.8. I definitely was disappointed when I took my first picture. I was like WTF? And of course the glass you use can make a huge difference in quality of pictures. 50mm 1.4 and 35mm 1.8 are not top notch lenses in this world but they are very capable to capture amazing quality pictures. Any lens I used seemed to make the pictures soft. I also notice a lot of purple fringing on my subjects. So to make sure I am sane and not talking due to user error, I compared pictures of my friends D90 + my lenses and wow... oh well life isn't fair and it blows. I was in denial for the longest time until I read others people review and it hit the spot on how I felt. Hmm...now what to do? Guess I will ""try"" and see if Nikon will fix it.","January 31, 2012",

The D7000 is a mixed bag of good and bad. Its extremely quick and responsive. It is realitively easy to move from D90 or even D80 to this camera as most of the controls are similiar. The ISO performance is outstanding..at least two stops better then D90..acceptable up to 3200 with little post production. The metering is very good and the colors produced are very appealing. The cons..bad fit for large hands..or big glass. The images seemed softer then my D90. I tried everything to make this camera work for me..setting changes ..lens changes..etc..and just could not get any satisfaction for the image quality. ONe thing ..I never printed anything and someone mentioned a poor monitor..or one that does not show the quality of images ..so be sure to print up images..before you decide they are not sharp. Too bad I did not know this before returning.I would even be willing to try another unit it is that good a camera. I think the grip is very small and cramped for larger hands..which also turned me off. I actually ordered a grip but this did not help...infact made the whole unit feel unbalanced. I did not get the NIkon grip which may be heavier therefore better balanced. Try this camera at a local camera store before ordering..make sure its a good fit for you physically.,"August 13, 2011",
cameras,Lens Creep With 18-200 VRII Lens & Focus Issues -- Lousy Customer Service,"Lisa S. Thomas ""Book Lover""",R1JBK6X4URTAX,3,"I bought the D7000 as a package through Amazon's retailer, Adorama. I've had it less than 30 days at this point. I do digital artwork, which means I photograph everything from landscapes to macro images, and I process everything through Photoshop. First issue I've noticed with this camera and lens is that it is very slow when used in anything from full manual mode (which solves a great deal of problems). When you don't rely on the camera to ""make"" your images (auto-focus, white balance, auto-exposure, etc.), you can work around some of the issues. When I do have to use some of the camera's modes, there are issues of off-and-on crispness. The lens that came with this package is cheaply made, and engineered so poorly that ""lens creep"" occurs at about 70mm if the camera is held at less than a 90 degree angle. This throws everything out of whack.I called Nikon service to ask is there was any repair possible on the lens creep issue on the lens. While they were courteous, it was concluded there was no point in sending in either the body or the lens as they are aware of the problems and have no fix for them. And they offer the Nikon customer nothing, which I find appalling. Nikon is well aware of the problems with this camera and this lens, and, if they were a responsible company, they would either do a recall, or offer the customer a discount on another model and lens that doesn't have the issues of this one. But no. What an arrogant way to do business.At the end of the day, I'm too entrenched in Nikon products (like the great Speed Flash and my fixed distance lenses) to give up the ghost on Nikon. I'm also not able to spend $7,000 for a pro body. Adorama offered to take back the whole package, but that doesn't really solve anything other than save up for the better body and hope my lenses are compatible with it.Shame on you, Nikon. You used to set the bar for the SLR cameras back in the day, but all you produce is flawed equipment and disappointed customers.","February 28, 2013",
cameras,SOME IMPORTANT LIMITATIONS,Altitude Arts,R3NFYCUEASX8XH,3,"Great-looking files come flying out of this body, but before you switch from a previous prosumer Nikon you should know that:1. No PC/Sync Socket. If you shoot plugged into strobes you'll need to dust off your D100's old SafeSync or buy another Pocket Wizard.2. No CF cards. You'll need to buy SD cards which may be a drag if you already have 157 gigs of CF. And remember: These files are bigger. They chew through cards faster. Use ""class 10"" for HD video.3. Bizarre menu change: Rotate Tall only works in playback. If you shoot portrait orientation via video or HDMI, you're outta luck. Your stuff going to show up sideways which art directors really love. But if you bring your entire production to a screeching halt, you can play them back properly. Absolutely, frustratingly senseless.4. Mini HDMI socket!

cameras,People raving about this is misleading,Bhoomireddy,R2CKWU6Z9WX38E,3,"Seriously! After reading some reviews I felt this will be the answer to my prayers. I bought it yesterday and am returning in a couple of days. The pictures are horrible at room light, dark edges, blurry when object is moving even slowly (with scene being sports/ child). Even outside the edges were soft and a little dark. The focus is an issue, as many point out in many forums. I can attribute this to the lens probably, but how will I know? I had a 60D (18-135) for a while, which was fantastic compared to this.This review is to let you know people that many reviews are written by experts who use expensive lens. With normal kit lens (18-105), D7000 is not worth it. 60D was a lot better with its kit lens and 300 cheaper.And the video autofocus is a joke. Rather should have not included it and advertise it.Edited after 30 days of use: Ok guys, A little better now, so improved the ratings from 2 to 3. The SLT a55 is ultimate in video, but fact remains its not an SLR, its a great p&s.; Though i still rate 60d higher in some aspects, the ease of use and some features in D7000 made me still stick with this though the image quality can be debated, but with kit lens i cant expect more than what i saw.

cameras,"Good for plug-and-play usage, but difficult to customize use (see end of review for instructions)",Edward Barnett,RWJ92SI9KZD4K,3,"This is a decent camera that will work well if you want a simple plug-and-play webcam for monitoring purposes. Setup is a challenge, though, if you decide to configure and run the camera manually, rather than using D-Link's software and portal. (If you want to manage the video without using D-Link's portal, I've included instructions at the end of this review.)Positives:+ Good looking, fairly unobtrusive camera with a nicely designed ball-and-socket mount that can be set on a table or mounted permanently on a wall.+ Video quality is fine for room monitoring at the default configuration (320x240 pixels) and quality can be improved four-fold by resetting the video to VGA (640x480 pixels). This isn't the same quality as an HD cam, so I wouldn't use this camera for Skyping, but it's fine for a room monitor.+ The DLink web service makes it simple to view the video feed from an internet connection when you're away from home, if you choose to use their portal.+ If your router supports WPS Setup, setting up the wireless connection is as easy as pressing a couple of buttons.Negatives:- If you don't want to use DLink's web portal for remote monitoring, setting up the camera manually requires a fair amount of technical knowledge. I didn't like the idea of having DLink manage my video feed, so I went for the manual setup approach. Unfortunately, there is no documentation for doing this, so you need to be comfortable configuring network devices. Basically, DLink assumes you'll use their service if you want remote access.- If you don't need remote access (e.g., if you're using this as a baby monitor), things are a bit easier, but not trivial. You'll need to manually hunt for the camera's IP address on your subnet, login, and manually configure the camera. Once I figured out the IP and login name and password (which aren't in the setup guide), configuring the device for use at home was pretty straightforward.- If your router doesn't support WPS, getting the wireless connection established is a challenge. You have to connect the camera to the router with a Cat5 patch cable, search manually for the IP, login (again, the manual doesn't give default login credentials), and manually set up the wireless connection.In a nutshell, this is a decent camera, and if you want to use DLink's software for configuring the camera and their portal for monitoring the video feed, it's a good, simple choice. But DLink assumes you'll use their approach, and if you want to set up and use the device without using their software (which I didn't want to install on my laptop because it's a work computer) or portal (which I didn't want to use because I didn't like the idea of DLink managing my webcam feed) then you need to have technical knowledge and be willing to spend some time, without the benefit of instructions.UPDATE: I finally managed to configure this camera manually and have it set up for monitoring from outside my network without using DLink's portal. If you decide you want to do the same, here's how:- Connect the camera to your network with a Cat5 patch cable. Using a browser on any PC on the network, search for the camera (you can use a utility to find connected devices, or just start entering IP addresses on your subnet until you get a hit).- Once you get a response from the camera, go to the setup tab then to wireless setup and enter the SSID and pre-shared key for your router so that you won't have to keep the camera connected with the Cat5 cable.- Then go to the network setup and enter a static IP address, enter your router's IP (the one on your subnet, not the external IP) into the default gateway field, and enter a port number other than 80 into the HTTP port field (80 is the default but many ISPs block port 80).- Next, log in to your router and set up port forwarding to forward activity on the port you set in the last step to the static IP address you entered in the last step.- To access the camera from outside your network, fire up a browser and enter your router's external IP address followed by a colon and the port number. If you have a dynamic IP address from your ISP, you can use a service like DynDNS.org to get a common name keeps up with your ever-changing IP address. You can also download a free/cheap livecam app on your iPad or iPhone that lets you monitor the video feed remotely.Important: You'll only need these instructions if you want to configure your DLink cam manually and want to monitor it directly without using DLink's portal. The easier approach (by far) is to use the CD that comes with the camera, load and run DLink's setup software to configure the camera, and use their portal for monitoring. But I didn't want to use their software or portal (I try not to load lots of potentially buggy software onto my computer, and I don't trust D-Link's security enough to have them managing my webcam feed), so I took the time to figure out the manual approach. I hope these instructions are useful to anyone else who wants to do the same.","July 30, 2011",
cameras,"Crap as delivered, OK after firmware update",SixteenAcres,R1H61ODIPD9W8B,3,"As delivered, the camera came with firmware version 1.02, which was barely functional. The camera could be viewed over the internet, and that was about it. I couldn't get it to email me photos, nor could I get it to store movies on the micro SD card. After updating the firmware to version 1.12 the situation got better, and now the camera appears to work acceptably, although not quite as well I would like.The things that I like about it are that it is very flexible, offering a choice of saving photos or short movies to a variety of storage destinations (FTP, email, SD card), and it does deliver an image in near dark thanks to the IR capability.The not-so-impressive things are many, however.1. Image quality is so-so (only 640 x 480, and not very sharp at that)2. Wireless performance is not great (barely able to transfer a live image unless the camera is in the same room as the router in our house).3. When you log in to view the camera it transfers your password in the clear (seriously? this is a security product?).4. It switches into IR mode in all but the brightest situations.5. The field of view is not very wide. I would estimate it at around the equivalent of a standard 50mm normal lens.6. The shutter speed is slow in most situations (meaning that people are blurred if they're moving at all).7. Finally the camera mount is pretty flimsy and doesn't like to hold it's position very well.The support for the Mac platform is adequate but not extensive; they have a camera utility that runs on Mac OS X, but you have to go their web site to get it. The MyDlink feature works OK; I can view the camera from my iPhone and listen to the room where the camera is situated.Would I buy it again? Maybe. I apparently got a deal on my first camera, as Amazon sold it to me for only $108. Now the price is $150, and at that price it isn't necessarily a great deal.","August 8, 2012",

Remote viewing setup was achieved after the second call to tech support to find out I needed to install software from their website which I had to Google as he sent me to the wrong site. Their support seems to have a 3 minute window to close calls and they try to mark the issue resolved when it is not. I finally installed a third party software program to enable motion detection much better than their software did. Everything was fine until we had a power outage and the camera would not reconnect to the network. Dlink told me it was my wireless router and hurried me off the phone. It is not my router. The fourth tech I called told me I was typing in my IP address incorrectly when in fact the software should detect the network settings automatically and I know how to type in the ip address correctly. He hurried me off the phone as well saying he would escalate my call to a tech who would call me back within the hour. I got a callback three hours later and the tech said he would send some setup program via email. I still don't have the app and the camera is still not networked.

cameras,What You'd Should Expect For the Cost,Jim,R1Y2HQPQZR2FIK,3,"Easy installation, wireless works fine. Lots of software options for network/picture setup. Video quality compares to a $10 web cam. Picture quality is poor in lower light situations; bright sunlight it's acceptable, but the lower the light gets the worse the picture gets. In the house during the day produces lousy video quality.Power supply cable is WAY too short which limits placement of the camera.IR mode is nice, usable video in a pitch dark room. Audio is unusable because of static/clicking noises as other reviewers mentioned. Fortunately you can configure the audio to OFF.

cameras,Returning camera,IgS,R28U0DYOFHZBTC,3,"This camera is not very suitable for surveillance/security purposes, but may be good for a teenager interested to learn how stuff works. Installation requires using CD and upgrading firmware. Configuring wireless access requires some knowledge of networking at the intermediated level. There are some bugs, eg, could not configure the camera to record video on microSD, although emailing videos worked (there is a discussion of video recording issues on the site ""forums.dlink com""). The camera arm is flimsy and doesn't hold camera in place; constant hissing background noise and no usable sound; occasional clicking noise (switch?) from the camera. Motion detection appears can't be adjusted for sensitivity, and camera will flood your email account with snapshots or videos, even when selecting low sensitivity and short time intervals.

cameras,It's ok but needs improvement,John,RE7RA6RMROPD4,3,"After following the plug and play instructions to the letter, I ended up having to use my IT knowledge to install my cameras and get them working on my Verizon wireless router. IT guy here. I could imagine that any brand wireless camera that needs to get married to your wireless access point could present similar problems, or if installing using a wired Ethernet connection, so I'll withhold poor marks to Dlink but this is something they could improve upon.I bought two of these. The first one is still working after about 6 weeks. I just had to return the second one because something came loose from inside around the lens area and it caused the picture to have a permanent shadow on the left hand side of the viewing screen. I tilted the unit sideways and the obstruction seemed to slip out of the way. Possibly heat from staying on 24x7 caused something to detach, maybe a piece of film? Strange because the camera was set up in an area that gets no traffic so I know nothing hit it. I returned it to Radio Shack and sadly, the only one they had to replace it had a nylon mount which connects the camera onto the swivel base. I can already tell this is not going to reliably hold the camera in place and I wonder why they went from the older mount which was made from either metal or hard plastic with chrome over it to this poor design. Or, this was the earlier design. Either way, I will be calling customer support to ask for a sturdier one.Though you could tie into your router and connect to the cameras directly, I went the easy route of creating a ""My Dlink"" account on the Dlink web site and thus the video/audio is streamed there in order to viewed from my iPhone, laptop, remote PC, etc. I have noticed that sometimes the cameras will mysteriously not show up on my account as active. This means you can't see the video feed. Give it an hour or two and it may come back, or it may require a reboot of the camera. This is frustrating if you are away from home.These are my first wireless IP cameras that I have dealt with. Note something I missed, and that is that the video is in black and white. It does the job though and I really don't have any complaints about the resolution. The infra-red video is impressive, even in total darkness. I was pleasantly surprised that I could see everything in total darkness. (I mostly use an iPhone to monitor).I use a Mac Pro which comes with Safari for the web browser. I gave up trying to update everything, install Active X or Java or whatever else it was that seemed to be a road block to be able to even manage the cameras on Dlink's web site in my ""My Dlink"" account. I finally ended up downloading Firefox's browser and using this browser for the Dlink monitoring and adjusting settings remotely or from inside the house.The motion detection feature has been useless to me on both cameras. It's really cool to sit there and use the interface to draw the area of the screen that you want to be monitored for movement but here's what I got on both cameras as a result. The camera will email you either a 6 second video clip or a still. I found that even on the least sensitive setting, using an area of the screen that just cannot move, it still falsely detected motion and flooded my inbox with clip after clip after clip. If you're really bored, this might be cool but if you only want to know when there truly is movement, this will quickly become annoying.The audio is very impressive. I found that I could hear conversations in the other end of my house.There is a timeout on the My Dlink site that will disconnect you from your session after a certain amount of time. This means that you must continue to log back in and connect in order to keep seeing the video stream. Not a problem if all you want to do is check in and see if the kitties are all good but annoying if you want to monitor for a while.I paid $149 at Best Buy and then $139 at Radio shack for the second one. For what I got, I would much rather have paid around $65-$75 so I'm going to say that I find these a little expensive for what you get and I say this just from cost to benefit standpoint, not in comparing them with other brands and models.I think if I bought a third camera I would be tempted to try another band. However, I have gotten used to the little iPhone app that requires only two taps to be watching the house from a remote location. I am sure that you can't get other manufacturer's cameras rounded up with the Dlink cams in the My Dlink app.I probably would not have even written a review but the cheap nylon mount was a disappointment. I believe I rated everything else fairly though.Good luck","May 10, 2013",

Out of the box it runs in 320 mode but by changing default advanced settings in browser it can be changed to 640 which is better. Colors are way off from reality.

cameras,Not necessarily the best,Chalupa Batman,R1Y9AQBH23XPPV,3,"The cameras seem very nice and have a great amount of features. Unfortunately because it's based on wireless internet, which is a very good feature, I have problems getting a camera to work well because it's at the other end of the house at the edge of my wireless signal.The app for my phone is a little wonky as well. It has a lot of trouble connecting to the cameras but the website always seems to work. It would be nice if the app was a little bit more stable. I think it could easily be fixed with an update in the future.Other than that, it's a great buy. I have it set up with picture capture based on the motion detection and it dumps them all into an email account I created and set up just for that. Some of the cameras don't work as well with the motion capture as others but that could be based on a number of different variables outside of the settings.EDIT: Also be wary of reflective surfaces. I have these sitting in different windows all over my house. I have to put them at angles so that when it switches to night vision, they don't reflect directly off the windows and cause massive glare. I still get a reflection off of the screens on my windows so I will have to take them off in order to be able to have the cameras work with night vision.

cameras,"The camera does what its supposed to, but not impressed with this solution for viewing the feed",John S,R21MEAO18OR4RD,3,"I picked up one of these cameras to act as a baby monitor for when we're downstairs or outside while the kid is asleep. To be honest, the camera works well, it clicks over to infrared mode in low light automatically, it picks up amazing detail in pitch dark using only 4 LEDS, and I'm happy with the quality.The setup was not quite as easy as the instructions make it out to be, but the instructions also assume your network is simple, right out of the box. I've very security minded so I don't broadcast my SSID, I filter my MAC addresses, and I have a complex password so the WPS configuration did not correctly create the connection to the camera. I had to wind up doing the config manually but to me it isn't a big deal. I had to hard-wire it initially to get it to connect but once I got in the camera the setup was pretty easy and it worked right away.Here is my only complaint with the product thus far. I'm a Mac user so I had to download a separate installer because the OS X software didn't come with it, not a big deal, BUT....in order to view the feed on my Mac, I had to create an account on mydlink.com and I have to log in to see it. The camera automatically streams out to the internet, so I have to go out to the internet to view a local feed in my house. Thats right, I have to go out to come back in. This is a bad practice since the device is local to my network. The only way to view it locally is to go through the web interface itself. As one of the other reviewers stated, it sends the traffic in the clear (HTTP) and I'm not keen on the idea of having a live stream of my house, much less my baby, sent over the net unencrypted. Theres no option to turn off the feed to mydlink so I blocked all outbound communication from the camera on my router to prevent it from broadcasting. I like the option of seeing the feed remotely, but security is more important to me so I'll setup an account on dyndns and get to it directly if i have to.What they do not tell you is that the app they have for iphone/ipod/ipad does the same thing, forces you to log into mydlink. You can't view the feed from the web interface on your iphone/ipod/ipad because the devices don't support activex or java, so I had to purchase a 3d party viewer to watch the stream from the local 192.168.x.x address.In conclusion, the camera works fine, does everything I expected of it, but their solution for viewing the feed (at least on a Mac), while convenient, is NOT secure and does not support local viewing natively. It would also be nice for them to include an option to stop outbound broadcasts as a security feature.","February 20, 2012",
cameras,"Good day/night video, static in audio, camera settings feature poor","13 ""foxytango""",R1XICRPEQJN2NV,3,"I purchased this camera as a pet cam for our newly adopted dog. I bought this because it was a network camera at a good price and had day/night vision. It was easy to set up once you have the right router (I had to purchase a new N router). Setting up an account in mydlink.com was simple and is how you would view what your camera sees via the web. However, I noticed a lot of static in the audio. After contacting their customer support, they said to change the audio setting. That was not an easy thing to do as in order to do this, you have to go through your account at mydlink.com to get to your ""advance settings"" page to get to the audio setting. I was not able to get to my settings page using IE, Chrome or Firefox internet browsers. There was a security certificate problem. I finally got in via Safari. I contacted customer support who told me that they were aware of the problem and was working on it with no estimated time to fix it. Now back to the audio problem. Once I got into my settings page and changed the audio setting down to 30%, the static was still there, i.e. no change.I also wanted to use the FTP feature to send my video to my account at Camiolog.com where I can archive my video for later viewing. That was also a fiasco. The username field in the dLink settings page for FTP was too short to accommodate the long token key used in Camiolog.com which was supposed to be entered into the username field. I again contacted customer support who told me that there was no way around this problem.This camera for the price is OK if you don't need to change the settings for the camera and can tolerate the static.

I dont know why I was expecting more though...lol the sound is terrible so if you are considering this because you need sometyhing that picks up audio as well as video, forget it. All you get is static... Honestly, I have no clue as to why D-Link even bothers including sound as part of this. The video is pretty decent, remember, this is no top of the line security cam, it is probably best suited for use as a baby cam or cam to see whats been eating all the bird food...lol the motion sensor works very good and it will email you everytime it trips.... EVERY TIME!! Even with the sensitivity set at 5%, Ill get an email everytime ANYTHING trips the cam. Not bad but opening up outlook in the morning and going through over 100 pics of either one of my cats or what ever moved in the yard is a little aggrevating.. but as i said, it works well in that regard. I just wish I could use what ever trips the motion detection for this to trip my DSLR... that would rock! the live vid is kinda grainy and this cam is not good for distance, its better that it not be more than 10 feet or so from your target. and shooting through glass at night is impossible as all you get is the reflection of the lights on this thing.

cameras,Very good camera with lousy software,Dougie Fresh,R13ZRXCMIQ7LT4,3,"What didn't work:The very first thing the install CD does is to attempt to download 2 ActiveX controls. I've now spent a couple of hours trying to get past that step in the process, which without you cannot progress further. The troubleshooting steps say to go into IE and enable every setting under ActiveX (which IE and MS Security Essentials complain bitterly about). This had no effect. Next, I checked my AV settings (MS Security Essentials) and as far as I can tell, it is not blocking ActiveX controls. I am also running with admin privs so that's not the issue. Beyond that, there is no handy error message to Google, nothing. And, the wizard won't let you get any further. I downloaded the install CD from the support site thinking it might be out of date but the download behaved no differently.Separately, I downloaded the D-Cam software and tried to give that a go. The ""Main Console"" software can find the camera but says it cannot connect to it with no explanation given. The camera and the PC are sitting on the same desktop switch. The Main Console software itself it not very useful and takes over the entire desktop -- really bad behavior.What did work:The only way I can access the camera is to go into Windows Explorer, click on Network and then double-click on the camera there. It took some Googling to find that the default username is ""admin"" and the password is blank (later found this in the manual on page 19). With this, I get a webpage that shows the live camera feed. This page is able to run an ActiveX control but no idea if this is the same ActiveX control needed and not installed by the install CD. There's also an option to run a Java applet but this fails because the page it tries to run is ""not trusted"" by IE. The same error happens with the Motion Detection setup page. The page ""home.htm"" is not from a trusted publisher and the control in that page doesn't run. In addition to the live feed, the webpage allows the camera can be configured with user accounts and a password. All kinds of network settings can be made in here as well, like DDNS (for letting the outside world see the camera). I suspect this is what the install wizard would have walked through so it seems I am not missing much by not being able to use the supplied software. The feature set here is very rich and the UI is nice.As for the camera itself, it is very small and lightweight which, while nice, causes an issue once the network cable is attached. Because the cable attaches at the top, it becomes top heavy and difficult to position without it twisting to the whim of the cable or falling over. This can be remedied with a permanent install via the supplied screws but for now I have it propped up with a book until I figure out where it will go. For now, while testing it out, it's looking out into the backyard. Maybe it will spot the flock of turkeys that like to come around or maybe even a moose.The wireless N feature works very well. The setup, using the web UI, was very straightforward. It was able to find my access point and connected without an issue once I supplied the shared key. This is a good solution to the top-heavy cable problem above if you have a good signal. I notice no difference in video quality between the wired and wireless setups.The video feed, once set to 640x480, very high quality, is very good for a 'net camera. I could definitely make out detail in the feed and it would work very well as a surveillance or baby monitor camera. I have not tried the sound since it's looking out a window the sound would not be very useful. However, as a baby monitor I can see how it would be. I definitely wish we'd had something like this when the kids were babies.I haven't tried using the mydlink website and features yet. I am not sure if I will since the big feature, mobile access, isn't available for Windows Phone 7. They have an app for Android and iPhone. Hopefully, there will be a WP7 app in the future.Eventually, if this proves out to be a decent camera, I plan to install this in my garage, peeking out the transom window above the door for using it as a surveillance camera. If I can get the motion detection features working it would be nice to be able to record who comes and goes and/or setup an alert so even while inside the house we know if someone shows up in the driveway which is difficult to see from the main part of the house.[Update]I now have this camera mounted in the transom window above my garage door and I have a nice view of the driveway. The camera works great during the day but, because of the reflections off the glass, the night mode is unusable. This is not the fault of the camera, but something to consider if you need the night mode. You cannot mount it behind glass since the IR reflects off the glass and all you'll see is glare. At night, while in day mode, if the spotlight comes on I can see the driveway very clearly. This camera really works well in low-light conditions.I tried re-installing the D-Cam software and I was able to get it to work. However, the software does something incredibly annoying that cannot be turned off when it starts up. Everytime it comes up, it puts up a dialog telling me that for better performance I need to separate my OS from my data on to two separate physical drives. There is no way to automatically ignore this dialog box or tell it not to tell me again. Given that nearly 100% of off-the-shelf PC systems are configured with a single disk, why would you do this to your customers, 99% of whom are: 1) not going to know what that means and 2) have no clue how to ""fix"" the issue (non-issue) the software is complaining about. I would also dispute this claim. I have a hard time believing the stream from this camera is going to bottleneck a modern day SATA II or SATA III connection. How is a 70Mb/s connection going to bottleneck a 3Gb/s connection? Ridiculous. This is just bad design, period, and a completely unnecessary hassle for customers. I immediately uninstalled the software and I'll stick with the view through the built-in webpage.","January 19, 2012",
cameras,OK image but bandwidth hog,Dan Eckhardt,R1V23VGT8YUBAZ,3,"This is an OK camera. Set-up difficulty was 6 on a scale of 10. Most likely because I have a Mac at home and had to use the beta install tool. That got the unit working when connected to the router. I had to call tech support and go through the router-assigned ip address to configure for wireless. Tech support was OK but if I wasn't an OK tech person, I would have been lost.Image in day mode is decent. Night mode is grainy. It would have been better if it was a little crisper.Having said all that, I am still returning the unit because it is a bandwidth hog. The encoding is JPEG so to get a choppy color image takes between 2000-3000 kbps; the other unit I have encodes at H.264 and I am able to get a comparable image at 512 kbps. I use internet and internal bandwidth a lot and I plan to have 2-3 cameras. So this will not work... Too bad b/c the price was good.","December 3, 2011",
cameras,Good but not perfect by a long shot,California Papa,R2V3BQXJ711SH3,3,"As others say, audio static is horrible but installing them a snap. However, I ordered two and had problems with both and returned them. The first one worked for a week and then no longer was accessible via browser or internet. It was replaced and so far the replacement (a 930 model though) has worked fine for a week.Last night the second 932 became unaccessible on site using a local browser address or through Dlinks web address. The only way to reconnect the camera to local and internet access was to unplug it and plug it in again. That is not acceptable because it was for a second home six hours away and the purpose of the camera is to have remote viewing and alarms so therefore this camera was sent back as unreliable. I have ordered two other cameras of a different model (930s) and hope they prove more reliable than the model 932 cameras i purchase.Although the night viewing capability of the 932 seems to work well if viewing inside the house, you cannot point the camera out a window and use it. The glass reflects the infrared led light so the image is not acceptable. If this camera is to be used for outside viewing, the LED has to be turned off and the camera mounted tight to the glass to avoid glare. Therefore, the model 930 would be a better choice for outside viewing through glass which is my application. I am very impressed with the free Dlink viewing over the internet and the ability to change settings on the camera remotely as well. I love viewing my vacation home using my Android tablet or any PC with internet access. Dlink has an Android application I installed on my tablet and it works great.I will say the cameras are not as wide angled as the older Logitech WiLife cameras I have used for the last 4 years nor is their low light viewing as good. However, they do not require a computer to be running as the older wilife cameras do and a re way cheaper than the new Logitech Alert cameras which look to be very nice, but too expensive for me from my simple needs.So now I will have to wait and see if the 930 models stay up and running or not and if they do, I will be a happy camper.","November 9, 2011",
cameras,Good Unit When its working,Jibbie John,RRNFNLCDU79IO,3,"I bought 2 of these units for my makeshift surveillance camera network. What caught my eye was the web-based feature of viewing your cameras from mydlink.com. Its a lot faster when it comes to recording thanks to the Wireless-N functionality. They work great for daytime surveillance (as long as the sun isn't shining straight on the camera), but becomes useless once darkness rolls in. The DCS-932L is needed for that. I'm not sure well it will work for outdoor use, but its states its good for up to 15ft.I use the D-Link D-ViewCam management software to record daily to a desktop I have connected on the network. It took me a while to fine tune the timing and had occasional issues with the cameras going offline. I plan on reconfiguring the cameras this weekend. We'll see how it works.UPDATE: 9/24/11One camera just started acting up. All I get is bright white and faint images of close-by objects. Talking to DLink Customer Service about this. Having to do multiple resets to see if that will fix it.","September 22, 2011",
cameras,Decent Camera,J. Michael,R1HAS1NB9P2KP1,3,"I currently have a LTS Security camera set up but was wanting to buy another one to put in another room. Set up wasn't that difficult if you know a little about networking. I just connected it to my router then logged into the router to see what IP address it was given. After that I logged in using the default user name and password. The default user name is ""admin"" and the password just leave blank. Once logged in you are able to manually set the settings or use a wizard. The video when there is light available isn't the greatest but it works. The power cord is very short. I think they should have made it longer","June 30, 2011",
cameras,Not quite spy-gear,Amanda Richards,R2XQUT65SLXFWS,3,"First of all, the D-Link camera is relatively easy to set up - always the one to play with techie stuff first, my husband had it up and running in a flash (well almost a flash). Just attach the supplied cable to your computer, run the CD and follow the simple instructions and you're good to go. According to the instructions, you have two options to set up the camera: wirelessly or wired. Naturally, my husband tried the wireless option first, which didn't work because it claimed (spuriously, we believe) that it couldn't find the network, so he had to resort to the other method, which worked right away. We're using a Linksys wireless router.The camera works quite well indoors where the intensity of the ambient light is generally much lower than outdoors. However, in the brighter outdoor light it is difficult to discern what you're looking at (is it a bird, is it a plane?). The colour is not the best, but then again, it ain't a Nikon 7000. There is some amount of adjustment that can be done online to change the settings, but you'll need to create an online account/register your camera first with D-Link at [...] This is also necessary if you want to view your camera remotely. Strange enough, whenever I try to access the camera online, I get a message telling me that the application needs an earlier version of Java. However, after hitting <Run> for the next three dialogue boxes or so that pop up, it will display the picture. I tried accessing the camera from outside my home network but was unable to do so. Maybe firewall issues?? (Too much effort required to check this). There is also an iPod app that is quite good, minus sound.Night vision was surprisingly good too. In the dark, the images were shades of grey, but in brighter conditions, the colour returned. Four LED lights lit up whenever the night vision was activated (could be an issue if you wanted to place it somewhere discrete).On the down side, the camera has to be plugged into an electrical socket to work, and the cord it came with is very short. This means you have to either place it near an electrical outlet or use an extension cord. This would obviously have limitations on where you can place it. It also has to be connected to your home network whether wired or wireless.While in theory it could be used as a security camera, it has to be powered 24/7, so if you live in a country or area prone to an uneven power supply which could damage sensitive equipment, then you may want to consider that before getting it or you may need to install additional equipment such as line conditioners/UPS to protect your equipment.The sound is not very good. In fact, after a few hours use it started to make a clicking sound in an endless loop.Recommended for limited applications such as keeping an eye on kids (or pets, or pesky guests), or when you're avoiding (hiding from) certain people who come calling at your gate, but not as a dedicated security system.Amanda Richards, June 29, 2011","June 28, 2011",
cameras,Software Great / Wireless Reception Not So Great,Jinxers,R2WH4NKWKL0037,3,The surveillance software that comes with this camera is great. It has the ability to record on motion and handles up to 32 separate cameras at once. I have found the software to be rock solid so far with no glitches. One downfall of the software is the fact that there is no help feature or users guide that comes with it so you have to pretty much figure it out on your own. For most users that wont be a huge problem.The Camera itself does have some issues. Picture quality is OK but the real problem is the wireless antennas in these cameras. I had one set up 6 feet away from my router and max signal was 60%. If you are setting up farther than that away from your router forget about the cameras staying connected. To solve the problem of the weak reception from the camera antenna I bought a network range extender and configured it to act as a wireless bridge and hard wired the cameras to it. Now they work like they were intended to but I don't feel I should have had to spend another $65.00 to make them work 15 feet away from my router.Overall the cameras will perform satisfactorily if you can establish a good signal from your router. By the way I was using a Cisco wireless N gigabit router which should be more than sufficient.,"June 16, 2011",
cameras,"good enough for price, however..",Patrick D,R1SB1RHH9RO6LH,3,"Overall units seem like a good buy. Appear robust for casual use, probably wouldn't want to adjust position too often as somewhat flimsy rotation and lock knob construction. Packaging and setup instructions sufficient to work through setup. Note ONLY PC SOFTWARE comes on provided CD, you will need to download MAC OS version from web. Installation via wireless (N, speed 54mbps or better) router was slow but worked. Second unit setup was easier once I knew what to do. Installation of webcam in final monitoring location was best achieved with looking at live image on laptop, so the camera can be setup to the exact angle needed.The bad - the uplink appears to be fast enough when the laptop is connected directly to the wireless-N router, so the speed of wireless between router and camera is fine to see about 0.5-1 sec update images. Once I left the local network it became a different experience, which makes it almost useless to check remotely from computer (maybe cellphone works but could not try). So you log in to the dlink website and it installs the needed Java real-time software (each time by the way) to provide an image from the camera. Even with 100mbps wired connection the image was very slow to update, and many times could not connect despite multiple attempts. Finally tried to login from a different work computer. Did not have password, so I used to forgot password link. It emailed a default 8 character password. Would not let me login. Tried reset twice more, same problem. So have lost ability to access web-based viewer. Also tried the d-link app on ipad. Just would never connect, timed out.Basically fine if you are on home/local network, although don't expect super fast update. Web-based or app-based access from a remote login site did not work in any useable manner. Give if 1 star for this function, 4 star for basic quality and setup. Don't recommend this if you need to see the webcam from remotely located computer or wifi device as usually can't connect. Disappointing.","May 25, 2011",
cameras,"Fidgity Installation, Barely Functioning Audio",Sheryl Katz,R1W2SADP1NONF7,3,"The pluses of this camera are that the video view over the web is acceptable for surveillance. And, once you get it working, it works.The minuses of this camera are that the installation process can be fidgity. On my home computer, where I first installed it, I had trouble getting the network to recognize the camera. I have a network hub leading from my main router, and it absolutely had to be plugged into the main router to work. Once I got the hard wired network connection working, it took several attempts to get the wireless recognized. I tried using the push button set up for the wireless. Maybe it matters that I have a Linksys router, but the automated setup wouldn't work. After I set the camera up at home and tested it I took it to my business.At my business I had more problems with the setup. For some reason, with the network cable attached the camera kept grabbing the same IP address as the point of sale system. I had to give the point of sale system a fixed IP and exclude it from the DHCP range. Then I had to set up the camera and go into the desktop local web interface that is accessed from the camera's ip address. Once I got there I gave the camera a fixed IP for the LAN. I still had some trouble getting the wireless to work. I tried using the push button set up. Again, maybe because my router is a Linksys, it didn't work. I was able to manually set up the wireless by using the web interface and typing in the password.Once I got it set up it seems to be working pretty well as a way to see into my business when I'm not there. However, the sound barely works - it cuts in and out - mostly out. This camera is really intended for uses like monitoring dogs during the day. Since I know that all my dogs do is sleep I thought I'd try it at my business. It would be nicer if the sound works. DLink needs to fix the installation.","May 2, 2011",
cameras,Wireless Setup Could Be A Lot Easier,thehammer,R247XZGEHHFSRW,3,"I am a Mac user and, unlike some reviewers, I could setup this camera using my Mac. However, the software setup procedure was not simple nor straightforward. Having a good knowledge of LAN is important. Note, if you don't know what LAN stands for, you might not want to purchase this camera. If you have a geek friend, keep them nearby.After playing around with the settings, I got it connected and things seem to run pretty well. I use this as a webcam pointing outside. On a gray sky, there is a pink to red hue in the center of the picture. See for yourself at: VisitOregonSouthCoast.com. Also, the white plastic causes a reflection problem in the window. I suspect I will have to paint it black.On several mornings, I found that the cam had lost connection with my Verizon supplied wireless router. When I pulled up the router, I found that there were about 12 connections listed as the cam. I solved that problem by assigning the camera a fixed IP address.The range is not very good. I can use my laptop two floors away without any problems, but this cam will not connect. As a result, I have to purchase a second wireless router and run a Cat-5 cable from my DSL router to another floor. I don't know if the external antenna of the earlier model cam would help or not. [D-Link later told me the early model has similar coverage.]I contacted technical support via email with a series of pretty simple questions and they did not respond. [Note: They responded shortly after this review appeared.]SFTP is not supported, which is a huge issue if you need to connect to your website and secure FTP is required.Someday, one of these companies will take an inexpensive still digital camera with a good zoom and modify it so that it can be used as a webcam. That would be perfect.","March 24, 2011",
cameras,"Good video (except in low light), awful audio in mine, and be wary of the instructions",austin_Larry,RKIFUFWHJO864,3,"This is a cool gadget and it does work as a surveillance camera over the internet and/or if you have an Iphone with a free Iphone app (no audio on the app). The video is actually good except in low light. It is amazing how basic cameras can produce decent video. However the sound is horrible. I get this buzzing and hissing no matter what room I put it in. And tech support said there was nothing they could do. Keep in mind thought that might be my particular camera or wireless set-up.Which brings me to tech support and setting the camera up to use wirelessly. Do NOT use the instructions. The instructions are going to tell you that you can set up the camera by using the WPS button on your router. At least on mine that wiped out my network settings and made it impossible for computers and phones that had connected before to connect again. My router maker, the highly rated Mediabridge on Amazon, said that every router with a WPS button makes it so that if one device connects that way, they all have to, which is why they don't recommend it. Shame on Dlink for suggesting to use the WPS button when it might mess up people's network settings they use day in day out. That deserves at least a full star off for that alone.So I made multiple calls to tech support. They were always available but not very helpful. But I was able to figure out what to do because I basically figured my only option was to physically connect the camera to my router. You have to manually connect with an Ethernet cable the camera to the back of one of the slots on your router. Then use the Dlink software. This should allow the camera to be found and set up. After you have everything set up and a Mydlink account on the Mydlink page click on camera settings. A new window will open. On that window choose setup and then on the left hand side choose wireless setup. Make sure the SSID has the network name of the network you want to use, if not click site survey and it will look up networks. Then the key to getting it to work not tethered to the router, put in your network password in the Pre-shared key box on the bottom after choosing the correct security you use on your network. Then you should be able to remove the camera from a physical connection to your router and place it where you want. After I did that the camera did take a few minutes to change from red to green, but it does work anywhere now that it has the correct security key.As I mentioned there is an Iphone app. Search for mydlink lite. You have to have already set up your mydlink email and password. Put those in and you can see the video. It does work great but there is no audio, which in my case is fine since the audio scratchiness is unbearable anyway.. It also take surprisingly good pictures and saves them to your camera roll. Tech support kept saying you download the app from our website. And I kept saying that doesn't sound right are you sure the app isn't in the Apple app store? And of course it was in the app store. So it is what it is with their tech support, not impressive. Even with the bad manual and bad tech support I still would have given 4 stars if the audio had been ok. But my audio is unusable. However that might be some quirk with my network connection. But every other job I am asking my router to handle it is doing a superb job. So I either got a lemon audio wise or the audio is a problem. But for a basic surveillance camera, once it is set up it works pretty well. And the Iphone app is a nice fun thing.","March 16, 2011",

Also the sensor is not sensitive enough to detect light and will place the camera in night mode even though there is enough light. So to deal with that issue I have to place the camera on a schedule.

cameras,"A disappointing change from the s95, still a solid camera",M. rogers,R196DFG8J2HKU,3,"This camera, in my opinion, isn't nearly as good as the s95. However, it does have its positives, namely its user interface, wide angle lens and aesthetics.A very surprising positive for this item, is the user interface, specifically the button layout on the back of the unit. Canon reduced the total number of buttons and moved them around. Shockingly, I immediately adjusted to the new layout and found it very hard to return the unit, mostly due to the buttons' ease. After years of Canon's old layout, I am still amazed that I adjusted in less than a week to the new layout.The unit also features a rear thumb rest and front grip, combined with a less slick and more textured finish, the unit feels much better in your hand than the s95 ever did.The s100 features a 24mm lens vs. the 28mm lens of the s95. That is a huge improvement in wide angle shooting and creating more life-like scenes.Unfortunately, that's where the good ends on this camera. For me, the biggest issue is the awful white balance of this unit. As we all know, a big selling point of this point and shoot, is the 'bright' f/2.0 aperture lens. The s95 absolutely excels in low light shots, creating nearly 'professional' quality photos. I took a series of low/ambient light shots with both cameras on the same settings, under the same conditions and the results were absolutely night and day. The shots with the s95 came out bright and light, the s100 shots came out orange and dark. With a huge adjustment to the white balance, the s100 shots looked ALMOST as good as the s95 shots. When viewed on a monitor at 100% the shots lost a large amount of clarity and contrast.Canon 'upgraded' the CCD sensor of the s95 to a CMOS sensor. Apparently they've never heard the phrase 'if it's not broken, don't fix it.' Also, if you zoom to 28mm, the aperture goes to f/2.2, which is 'dimmer' than the s95 at 28mm.With these gripes aside, the s100 is still a solid performer. It just isn't an improvement over the s95. The bottom line is that the aesthetic improvements and wide angle lens do not make up for the white balance/darkness issues when shooting in low/ambient light. Canon, you messed up on this one.","November 3, 2011",
cameras,S100 vs S95 vs S90,Shawn C.,R2IXIAGT32VBKE,3,"This review is for people who owns a S90 or S95 and is thinking about upgrading to a S100.I owned a S90 since it first debuted and have been very happy with it. Monday I went to a local camera store and compared S95 vs S100 back to back including image quality on ISO 80 at 28mm & here is my impression: S95's image quality is noticeably superior, S100's image looks more washed out. S95's image is more consistent from center to corners but S100's image has 1 or 2 soft corners. At this focal point, S95's lens is brighter so has faster shutter speed. At ISO 800 both camera has pretty equal image quality but with such bright lens and good IS, you rarely shoot above 800 ISO. Unless you need the extra wide angle or slightly longer range I would choose S95 especially for the low price they offer. I do like the S100's better grip. I ended up taking the S95 home. I wanted to give 4 stars to the S100 but since it is 43% higher than the price of the S95 I give it a 3.Went home and compared S95 vs S90 back to back. Almost identical image quality except S95 has cleaner image processing at the darker areas due to an improve jpg processor. I also like the better ergonomics on the S95 and the price was $100 less than what I paid 1.5 year ago. Other notable improvement that was not mentioned in most reviews was there are more settings for Auto ISO: you can choose a slow ISO increase rate vs normal. In Program mode(P), the normal ISO increase rate was at 1/30"" shutter speed, but under slow ISO, the threshold is now 1/15"" which is very ideal for still or very slow moving objects in low light. This is just what I needed for the older S90 where under auto ISO setting, the camera wants to choose a much higher ISO than necessary thus produces poorer images, but now I just set it at slow auto ISO and let the camera choose the correct ISO. I can also set a upper limit in addition to the auto ISO. Most of the other pros & cons are already covered by someone else so I don't need to go over them any more.","December 3, 2011",
cameras,Lens Error after just one week,Vincent T. Lam,R1FREY71M0MV0S,3,"Just one week after I received this camera while on a vacation, it already died of the dreaded 'Lens Error'. I was using this camera normally in an indoor environment, with no sudden temperature change nor any physical shock, and all of a sudden when I tried to power it up again the lens would not extend out and it just showed a message 'Lens Error; Will shut down automatically; Restart camera', then turned itself off. If I pressed the play button then I was able to turn it on in play mode and look at the pictures that I've taken, but if I tried to turn it into camera mode then the same thing would happen. No luck with removing the battery and restarting. I decided to just return it. I may try my luck again and purchase one later because the image quality and features are really great. Hopefully Canon will have this design/manufacturing flaw fixed soon. By the way my daughter's S95 also got a 'Lens Error' a few months back. Fortunately it was still within the warranty period and Canon fixed it.I once tried to use the GPS logger function but it drained the battery in just over half a day, so it is really useless if you are on a tour going to difference places in the day because even if you carry a spare battery you just don't know when the battery was dead unless you constantly check it.I would have had given it 5 stars if not for such a poor reliability. And I still think this camera is worth buying just for the excellent picture quality. But you'd better be prepared for the poor reliability and have a spare camera when you are on a vacation or some other occasions which you don't want to miss.","May 10, 2012",

You will hear the rapid fire clicking noise of the auto focus motor several times per second upon playback during quiet scenes. The sound is subtle but noticeable during quiet scenes. The sound is not noticeable while people are talking, or music is playing, or there is background noise. Whether or not you can live with the autofocus motor noise is strictly a matter of personal preference. It is not a deal killer for what is otherwise a very nifty little camera.","April 14, 2012",
cameras,Lens Error!!!,Frederick E. Hutchings,R1M0KWGXQW3739,3,"The CANON web site has admitted that there was a mechanical lens flaw in a series of Powershot S100 cameras. They even listed the serial numbers of the flawed run. S/N starting with 29xxx through 41xxx. This is my second S100; the first is S/N 46xxx and is a dream to use. Ordered a second; it arrived; lens error; S/N 41xxxx. Am exchanging it. If the replacement is within the list of flawed serial numbers, it will be returned and exchanged again until I get one that is not in the 29-41 range. I can't take the risk that it will run for a few months and then fizzle.I would think it is a simple matter just to recall those within this numerical range before selling them. Canon can repair them and will free-of-charge. But why put the consumer through that hoop. They should have all been recalled; they do it for automobiles, so why not cameras, etc.?? And, I can't think of a single reason why Amazon check the serial numbers before selling to guarantee delivering a working product and perserving their reputation.For reference, see other one and two star reviews of this camera...UPDATE: Replacement camera arrives. Serial # is 47xxx and works fine so far. This would be a five star product if it weren't for the production run error that was not corrected by recall. Again, if you can recall an automobile, a point and shoot camera just should not be that great a problem. Will revisit this purchase after a month's hard use. So far, so good.","December 4, 2012",
cameras,Little mighty mite of a camera,"KJ in SD ""kevin18139""",R1VGNTOI4443XB,3,"Used a Canon G9 for several years and thought it was time to upgrade to get better low light performance so I went for a micro 4/3 in the Olympus E-PL3. I used that camera for 2 months and could just tell that it wasn't happening for me. I didn't like what I was seeing in ISO's above even 400 or so. Decided to try out this S100 and could tell after a week that this was exactly what I wanted. The more I shoot with this, the more impressed I am. Took it to the Natural History Museum and shot in several rooms with very low lighting and the high ISO shots look fine even at 800. I usually shoot on Auto or P with the RAW + jpeg and that works perfectly. Plus, the fact that this little camera fits into a shirt pocket, can't be beat. It's just like taking out an additional iPhone. I have no complaints.UPDATE: Like some others, I too had that lens error issue. The lens got stuck in the open position. Canon took care of it just fine but it was a pain to search their site for the information regarding the return/repair of the unit. What irks me about this issue is that the same thing happened to my wife's point and shoot Canon of a different model. With that one, it wasn't within the warranty so I looked online for a solution and one site said to just give the lens a ""whack"" on to something sturdy but cushioned. Figured I had nothing to lose so tried it and it worked. But, I got that camera a full year before this S100 and figured Canon knew about this problem but still let the production lines roll with this issue. I still like my S100 but am going with Sony and Panasonic for my next couple cameras. I've been using Canon gear for the past 30 years+ but a few things with them have irked me and I don't like what I see with them. Before this issue, I had a 5 star rating but had to drop it down by 2 stars. 2 recent point-and-shoots and 2 lens errors after about a year of ownership with both and we're talking serious issues. It might be engineered obsolescence with Canon? I wouldn't put it past them.","April 7, 2012",
cameras,Frustrating,Texas Celt,R2GZSIMXOB90A5,3,"Some of the reviews I've read make it sound like you can just put this camera in auto mode and take perfect pictures every time. After using mine for two days I can tell you that it ain't so. It is capable of taking some lovely pictures, with pleasing flesh tones and perfectly balanced lighting. But it can take some stinkers too--out of focus, yellow and overexposed (with flash and incandescent lighting). At times in an indoor setting the screen blurred annoyingly and there was a shutter delay of about 3-4 seconds, by which time the moment had passed. I love the special effects, like fisheye lens and color accent. A good camera for some but not all situations, although if you're a very knowledgable photographer and have taken the time to get familiar with all the settings then you'll probably have better results. Is it worth the money? Maybe, but not for me.I also have to agree with the complaints about battery life. After taking about 80 photos, most with flash, and 5 short videos of 5-30 seconds my battery was pretty much depleted. (Canon says camera should take about 200 photos per charge.) Video quality is generally ok, but I'll definitely stick with my Sony camcorder when I want HD video.Update: After playing with a Canon SX230HS I decided to keep the S100. It has a very solid, comfortable feel--compared to the SX230HS--and I'm getting more comfortable with the various menus and settings. For example, I can now quickly alter the white balance (which you would expect auto white balance mode to do, but it doesn't) and I've learned to use Program mode or Aperature priority mode in most situations. I've already mentioned that I love the in-camera special effects, and the slow-mo video too. Finally, compared to cameras I've had in the past there is remarkably little noise at high ISO settings. Still, for the person who just wants a quick-and-easy point and shoot that takes great photos I think the Nikon Coolpix S8200 is a better choice.","January 22, 2012",
cameras,Very nice camera with one major drawback,Selman,R141M61VYZNAPH,3,"I love the flexibility of this ""semi-professional"" camera. Night shots are great as is quality. Beware that early models have a defect that in high heat and/or humidity, a piece breaks and you can't close the lens. Canon fixes this defect free of charge. Unfortunately this happened when I was in Panama for the first time but at least I had a backup camera.My biggest complaint is the autofocus. I have returned it to Canon twice and they say that all S100's are made this way. In video mode, the sound of the autofocus as it moves back and forth comes out on the audio track of the video and at times you can not hear what you are trying to record. I have the SX-210IS which is similar but the noise level is much lower, almost unnoticeable. There are other Canon's that don't have ANY noise from the autofocus in video format.","February 15, 2013",

cameras,"Image quality great most of the time, video could be better.",Bruno Zanchet,R334ENTTB8PQ29,3,"Bought this camera a month ago at Best Buy, I hate those long reviews so here are my thoughts:Pros:- Image quality with 1/1.7"" sensor are amazing- Low light images astonishing most of the time- Full manual controls, very customizable on P and M modes, Raw- Amazing body texture, feels great and doesn't scratch easely, perfect grip- Small size really pocketable, the smallest compact-enthusast on the market- Full HD video with zoom while recording- 24mm amazing for landscapes and indoorCons:- Video is jumpy beacuse of the 24fps, would be great to have a 30fps or 60fps on next generation. I could not use the camera to make movies while walking, as I usually do on trips, gonna use my Sony TX-100V for videos unfortunately.- Zooming on video is really slow, but understandable.- Aperture at the end of zoom f5.9 is horrible, at low light make images noisy and have a weird color. I would prefer a 4x zoom.- Pop-up flash is annoying, right where my finger stays...- The auto mode sometimes doesn't get the picture right...- Flash cano note be adjusted, causing too bright pictures at night in the auto mode.- Focus is not good in lots of the photos...Update 16/04/12:After a month using, the S100, I can say that the camera is flawed. Serius auto focus issues, auto mode doens't get the picture right in lots of photos. Also, the colours are not vivid...

cameras,Improve over S95 in low light and video but also have more issues,rick,R2RO4H52HZD2M7,3,"I had S95 and did some comparison.I wish I can said is a lot better, but reality is 2 steps forward and 1 step backward.2 step forward are the new cmos sensor and digi 5 help the camera achieve very good low light indoor image and video is capable of 1080p with auto focus and can zoom however is not with issues. Discuss that later. The camera start up is fast seem to be faster than s95. Focus shot to shot is also improvement but could had been better. In s95 i can't use iso more than 400 it cause too much noise, but with s100 i can use iso 1600 still pretty good, pcmag said s100 can use up to iso 2000. Which I can is probably true. Is best in class for the iso test. Video is excellent. Soem of the video in outdoor can match quality of those mirror less camera with their kit lens. S100 can beat mirror less camera in low light with their kit lens, is not fair comparison, but most people buy mirror less don't want to buy pancake since cost as much as this camera. The gps function is good but canon picture software doesn't do geotag automatic for you, just gave u the gps info is up to to use it, upload to site like flixr or picasa instead. S100 has better grip support than s95. the silver color of s100 really stand out better than black one, the battery in the s100 is made in japan, s95 battery is made in china.The issue with this camera is the shuttle lag freeze at some of the shots, usually during hot weather like 90 degree after you take like 50 shots in 30 minutes time frame, the camera will sometime freeze for few seconds before you can take another shots, is annoying i do not expect such issue with s95, the sensor or chip in s100 is hotter than s95, cause i do felt the camera is warmer after some use.Another annoying problem is the video focus usually during low light, u can easily hear the focus noise . Not too loud but is noticible, is the only p&s; with this sensor has this problem, other camera has to be like m4/3 sensor or larger to hear such noise. the auto iso in long expose is limited to 80 only, not usefull. Typical auto iso only goes up to 1600. the HDR and night handle mode is useless without tripod. sony camera hdr can use it without tripod as well as night handle mode. How can canon call hand handle mode if you still need tripod. Also no panorama mode, canon is the only major camera brand doesn't offer that feature only assist you mode. You must buy spare battery for this camera, just get the after market one only like $15 or less, you might need 2-3 if you gonna shoot more than 400 photos without charging. Gps on does eat you battery and take 1 to 3 minute to find the position.Bottom nice this camera does 2 part very well better than other in the same class such image and video, but function and having some issue first of its kind in the class can be annoying and cause you to miss the shot so tradeoff is there. you need to had patient and good hand to use this camera3It seem after my long complain of this camera why I still gave 4 out 5, fact is still gave you such good image and video is hard to complain the 2 major factor what you need the camera, yes sony and Panasonic and other gave you far more feature, canon often gave you the least feature for the $ but usually best in image. Unless panasonic came out new lx with 1080p 60fps and smaller is hard to beat this camera. Wish many of issue will get fix in future patch.","April 21, 2012",

The GPS works, but not usually indoors and some times takes a few minutes to sync. This may be a function of my position and the position of the GPS satellites. Even after it shows sync, it often does not have the altitude for a few more minutes.3. Picture quality is very good.The bad news:1. If you want the GPS to work with the pictures you are taking, you need to leave the camera on. Unfortunately, when you leave the camera on, one would think there would be a way to have the camera not keep running the rear display. I've set it for 10 seconds and indeed, it goes off, but it keeps coming back on and I don't push any of the buttons, but do have it hanging by the hand strap. This means the battery life is terrible.

On this camera, the flash pops up by itself, automatically, unless the camera flash is set to 'No flash'. My problem is that I hold the camera with two hands, and my index finger on the left hand always rests on top of the flash.

cameras,All features updated compared to the S95!,Melika,R1DEDAPRFRCVD8,3,"When Canon revived its PowerShot S range with the S90 in August 2009, it was in acknowledgement of a clear demand from enthusiast photographers for high quality yet pocketable cameras offering extensive manual control. The S95, which followed almost exactly a year later, stuck with much the same formula - a relatively large sensor (at least in compact camera terms), a 28-105mm equivalent zoom lens with a fast F2 maximum aperture at wideangle, and a multi-functional control dial around the lens. But while its successor, the S100, looks much the same again on the outside, it is to all intents and purposes a brand new camera.Crucially, the S100's three key imaging elements are all entirely new. The lens range has been extended wider and longer, to a 24-120mm equivalent 5x zoom; it retains the fast F2 maximum aperture at wideangle but is limited to a rather less-impressive F5.9 at telephoto (an inevitable consequence of the camera's compact dimensions). Secondly the S100 debuts Canon's latest DIGIC 5 image processor, which the company says is six times faster than the previous version, allowing more sophisticated image processing and noise reduction. But perhaps most significantly, the S100's image sensor is a Canon-made 12.1 MP 'high sensitivity' CMOS sensor in the 1/1.7"" format (approx 7.5 x 5.5mm); only the second home-grown sensor the company has used in a compact camera after the PowerShot SX1 IS of 2008.Canon says the new sensor employs technology similar to that used in its EOS SLRs, including an on-chip noise cancellation system, and microlenses which cover more of the sensor area to improve its light-gathering characteristics. The company claims that this results in reduced noise and increased dynamic range; the maximum available ISO has accordingly been increased to 6400. A 4-channel readout system also improves the continuous shooting rate, up to 2.3 fps compared to the S95's maximum framerate of 1.9 fps. For real speed freaks there's also a scene mode that can capture 8 frames at an impressive 9.6 fps, but it's limited to JPEG images only, with no manual control.Compared to PowerShot S95 - key differencesThe S100 is in effect a whole new camera compared to the S95; almost every key feature has been upgraded or updated: 24-120mm (equivalent) lens range, F2.0-5.9, built-in neutral density filter 12.1 MP 1/1.7"" Canon CMOS sensor DIGIC 5 image processor ISO 80-6400 2.3 fps continuous shooting (9.6 fps for 8 frames in High-Speed burst mode) Full HD (1080p24) movie recording; H.264 compression, MOV format Optical zoom in movie mode Super slow motion movie recording (640 x 480 @ 120fps, 320 x 240 @ 240 fps) Direct movie record button Built-in GPS unit with image tagging and logger functions","December 26, 2012",
cameras,Nice Pocketable and Versatile Camera,"Theodore Smith ""Born Again Skeptic""",R3ST2SSKILH9PY,3,"In average lighting conditions this camera excels. However if you are shooting in conditions where there is much contrast between areas in your shot, the camera will tend to blow out the highlights if exposed for darker areas or extremely underexpose areas if the exposure is set for lighter areas; in other words, the dynamic range shown by photographs is really lacking. My photos on top of Haleakala at sunrise hardly begin to show the range of light and shadow that I could see. The exposure can be locked by pressing the shutter button halfway down; if you scan around in an automatic exposure mode the camera will show what the shot will look like and when you find what you like you can hold the shutter button down, compose the shot and shoot it. The shooter has a lot of manual control over the camera which allows for far greater flexibility than a simple point and shoot. Flash: why did Canon even bother? Very low output....The size of this camera makes it extremely easy to carry around and available for use; for most of the shots I took the results are quite good, but some where there is a lot of extreme between light and dark in the scene such as especially sunrise and sunset are a real disappointment.","October 3, 2012",

I don't want to wast time to change settings! I have two kids to look after during my trips ;)Having said that, I'm not happy because three things:1 - unacceptable distortion on wide angle. People's faces will be deformed if they are captured close to the last third of the frame;2 - The same old Canon's problem: tendency to overexpose creating pictures brighter than the real life. I find it hard to believe that in this 2012 we don't have technology to do real time HDR (high dynamic range).3 - The auto white balance (WB) does not represent real life. I have to use P mode and create my own WB (wasting time).So, unfortunately this is not a ""point & shot"", because if you do so, the pictures you will get are different from the landscape you saw: the grass will be less vivid; the sky might by white, and so many other surprises.But can this camera take good pictures?

I decided to give this onea try mostly based on the positive reviews and popularity of both theS95 and S90, hoping it would be a camera that would cover most ofmy photographic needs (at least on paper it was).I tested this camera along with a Sony HX9V. Have beentaking the same pictures with both, under the same light conditionsand with the closest camera settings I can use. The S100 beats theSony in most low light situations for obvious reasons (2.0 vs 3.5 maxaperture). But in almost every other situation: moderate, bright,overcast, indoors, landscape... the HX9V produces better results outthe camera without further processing. I wasn't impressed with the results of the S100 at ISOs over 400 and was especially disappointed with the auto WB results.Focusing, although fast and accurate when there's enough light available, israther slow in low light, and in many cases not able to lockfocus.The images produced by the S100 were not vibrant, sharp and detailedenough for me. They were a little on the noisy side at high ISO andthe color rendition was a little inaccurate, I'm guessing due to poor AutoWhite Balance.Video looks really nice and clear as long as you don't move thecamera. I mean, image stabilization works really well, don't take me wrong; the problem iswhen you start panning right and left, up/down that it looks reallybad. The frame rate of this camera I believe is 24fps so it's not very smooth. If you watchthe video on anything that's bigger than 20 inches, it looks so bad (the panning) thatalmost makes you dizzy.So I guess for someone who's not very concerned about photo and video quality, and is looking more for features, full manual controls, compact size and a nice user interface, this camera would be worth serious consideration. Or you can just buy a camera that will give you the same kind of JPEGs for half the price. I'm trying to get the best possible pictures without the need of much post processing (if I wanted to do that I would just shoot RAW with my DSLR).I decided to return it to BB today and will be getting the Sony NEX-5N instead. It's bigger in size but produces way better JPEGs out of the camera (some of the best I've seen) and gives me full manual controls and the option to shoot RAW if I want to. Would I sacrifice size for image quality? Absolutely. It's not a huge camera anyway. With some of the smaller lenses is not much bigger than the S100. The $270 price difference is worth from IQ point of view which is what I'm looking for.","November 7, 2011",
cameras,Full featured camera lacking in lower end usability,"Defector ""keep travelling""",R3A2KF6B7PKWBJ,3,"I've been playing around with this camera for a few days and whilst I enjoy the control it gives as a pocketable raw shooter.I do have a problem with it, the other night for instance I wanted to use it for taking group pics at a restaurant so I set it to full Auto.Occasionally it would pop the flash and other times it would not, but try as I may I could not get a decent picture with it, I either got blur from no flash or totally overexposed pics with flash.I noticed the camera just could not decide what it was trying to take a picture of, is it a portrait or a sport scene, either way it was having a crisis flipping between scenes and could not focus even with the IR Beam.I tried changing to aperture priority and then shutter priority, nothing seemed to work.So, my thoughts are it's great as a backup for my dslr during daylight, where it excels and useless for the majority of friends and family pics most of which are in low light and may or may not require flash depending on what the camera thinks you are taking a pic of.I'm thinking I'll return it and maybe try something else.","September 6, 2012",

My LX5 camera shows great video in low light when zoomed out. After reading the reviews at Amazon I purchased a Canon Elph 300HS. I tested this camera and found the quality of pictures to equal the S100 and the video indoors to be somewhat better. I love the Elph's smaller size and the build quality. The less expensive 300HS has many of the same features as the more expensive S100. Both cameras have 24mm wide angle len's, CMOS sensor, and 5X optical zoom.

cameras,"Average image quality, poor egonomics",Robert Cozzi,RX86WHMA7FYY6,3,"I've owned many PowerShot cameras from Canon over the years but moved up to DSLR about two years ago.Then earlier this year, for a trip to the Bahamas, I picked up a Nikon water proof AW100 to take photos while snorkeling. But I really wanted a regular pocket camera so I waited for and order the S100 pretty close to announcement day and got it last week.The camera certainly does a lot and has a lot of easy to use menu options for customizing the camera. But at the end of the day, there are two features I look for in a camera:1. Picture Quality2. Ergonomics (control layout)Picture Quality is pretty good. Although not as high a quality as the Nikon AW100 is an apples/oranges comparison I suppose. But just point-n-shoot produces descent images but I've seen better on other cameras of this size.Night shots were very good too, but again, ""compared to what""? But what I say to people who ask ""I have yet to take a great picture with the S100"".Some new point & shot cameras are using the new style CMOS chips with the ""wires on the back"" of the sensor. I used one recently (the AW100) and it is like night vs day in picture quality. The S100 uses a ""new for Canon Powershot"" chip, but it is still front-wired. Not my job to write about that technology, read up on it if you're interested.Ergonomic design is where the S100 really fails. The power button, shutter release and mode Dial are not well thought out at all. The mode dial should not be where it is--it blocks access to the shutter release. This causes you to have to reach over it to take a picture--it is obviously in the way, so why not put it elsewhere, like on the top right side of the back of the camera like they've done in so many other Canon PowerShot models.If you have the camera to someone and ask them to take your picture, you have the inevitable situation where they try to press the Mode button and you have to show them where the shutter release is located.The shutter release button is difficult to find--you're body just expects it to be the dominate button on top of the camera.Next is the Flash--cool idea and looks good in a demo video on a website, however in practice in 100 percent of the cases, my left hand is holding a finger over to the top of the flash as it tries to popup. Fortunately unlike some older Canon powershots with this feature, this set of power gears is stronger--and doesn't get stripped when you do this (which you will) like some older powershots did. Where are you supposed to hold the camera?All in all, this camera is going back. If it were a $200 camera, I'd probably keep it I the glove box of my car for quick & dirty shots, but for $429 its going back to Amazon. Sorry Canon, I really wanted to like this one, but unless you're a DSLR user who for some reason demands all the controls of a DSLR in a small camera, this is just an overpriced, difficult to use model for the money.","November 14, 2011",

cameras,Second thoughts on purchase of Cannon's S100,citizenj,R1Y1Q7X61HFZAA,3,"I will update this on an on-going basis.I may have ordered this item too quickly. Future buyers may want to do a little more research than I.I read many glowing reviews,studied comparisions between cameras, technical specs and etc from a variety of websites...some seemed biased, some did not; but then noticed the internet notice from July 2, 2012 about a recall for ""lens error"". Googling that phrase I found many, many dissapointed consumers of this model and cannon in general, specifically for their rough treatment of dissapointed customers.I gave it 3 stars based on the many glowing reviews, but less than 5 because of the very many disspointed and angry consumers posting about the quality. I will keep this updated, but to any future consumers; be sure to do your homework before deciding.Oct 1OK...I said I would update my original post in time and I am doing so:I received the camera in good condition and specified amount of time. I've been using it nearly daily for 3 weeks.Good:The camera certainly can do alot of things...there are many features that should satisfy both the most basic shutterbug and keep the pros pretty happy too ( like RAW file and fairly advanced controls.The camera has some pretty cool features like the ability to capture only one color and turn all the other colors grey scale (think of capturing all the orange pumkins in a pumpkin patch and leaving everything else in gray scale). It can do slow motion video at 240 fps. There are other cameras on the market for slightly more than can now capture at 1,000 fps.There is an adjustment ring on the front of the camera that allows additional control beyond the usual thumbwheel/rocker button on the back of most P&S;cameras and it is user setable.The not so goodPer the manufacture, the camera should not be exposed to temperatures above 104 F. There are many places in the US that get above that every day in the summer, so I guess photo of the AZ desert are out.The battery life states 200 shots or 40 mins of video. I found it to be less than that ( amout 1/2 ) in the course of a day with no flash and one or two videos. I purchased an extra battery ( ~$30)Concerned about the dreaded ""lens error"" issue I wrote Cannon to see if they have made a permanent fix. I never heard back. From a quality/customer service standpoint this is unacceptable. ( I'm a quality manager)Would I recomend this camera?Not for this price. It can do alot of things, is intuitive to use; but based on the ""lens error"" reports widely on the web, the short battery life, the lack of response from Cannon customer service and most troubling the 104F max temperature limit. I think P&S; cameras need to be a little more ruged than that.","September 11, 2012",
cameras,"Great zoom range, nice image quality, designed for dummies",A. Rose,RY0SGSYLCRNHE,3,"I bought this camera a month ago and I've passed the 2000 picture mark, so I guess I'll jump in and provide a review. I upgraded from the Canon PowerShot SX10 IS to this one and I've been thrilled with some of the new features and less than thrilled with others.The quick verdict:This is a great camera for anyone who wants lots of features and versatility but doesn't want to use manual settings and doesn't travel a lot.Pros: great zoom range, nice picture and video quality, improved low light performanceCons: ISO locked to 100 with >1 second exposures, proprietary Li-ion batteryHandling:The camera is a bit bulky, as you would expect from a camera with a 35x zoom lens, but I quickly got the hang of handling it. I tend to accidentally hit the zoom framing assist button when shooting. It seems to be right where my thumb wants to be when holding the camera, especially when switching between landscape and portrait orientation. I had similar issues with the SX10. I'm not sure I like the memory card being slotted in with the battery on the bottom of the camera. Access to the battery/card slot is blocked when attaching the camera to a tripod quick release plate.Zoom capabilities:The zoom range is a nice feature. The size of the full moon is about 1/5th along the long side of the image at full optical zoom and close to 850 pixels across. On a clear night, you can get some nice detail. Clipping the Raynox DCR-250 macro conversion lens on at full zoom and using a light box for trans-illumination, I was also able to take pictures of microscope slides at 125x total magnification on a 150 dpi test print. They look better than the images I took with a scope and CCD camera at the lab. Very nice!Image quality and low light performance:The image quality under low light and high ISO conditions has improved compared to the SX10. I took some images of kittens at the shelter in rooms that were poorly lit. With the SX10, I would end up with a lot of motion blur and noise on high ISO (800) images. Comparable images look better with the SX40, but some processing artifacts are visible when looking at the full size of the high ISO (1600) images. The camera ultimately was not able to stop the motion of kittens at play without the use of flash though, but I was expecting that under the poor light conditions.External flash:Speaking of flash, the camera works well with the SpeedLite 270EX flash. The hot shoe can be covered with a plastic cap for protection when not in use. It took me a few tries to figure out the best way to take the cap off, but with a closer look at the design once you get it off it becomes obvious. Having long enough fingernails to get under and lift the front of the cap makes it easier.Filters and lens accessories:The lens can be fitted with the same 58 mm Lensmate filter adapter as the SX10. Thin filters will work fine at all zoom settings, but thicker filters like a circular polarizer or stacking several filters will cause vignetting at wide angle. A little bit of zoom or a 67 mm filter adapter may help avoid the vignetting issue. The lens cap that comes with the camera will no longer fit once you put the filter adapter on. And speaking of the lens cap - Canon put a tether on it, so it can be attached to the camera thus reducing the risk of losing it compared to the non-tethered cap of the SX10. While that is a plus, the SX40 does not come with a lens hood like the SX10 did. That would need to be purchased separately.Settings:One thing I miss on the SX40 is the ""sunset"" preset under the SCN options that the SX10 offered. Out of all the SCN options on the SX10, that one probably saw the most use when I wasn't in M or Av mode, so I'll have to figure out an equivalent setting on the SX40. The snow, beach, and foliage settings are all still there, so why did the sunset disappear? The new settings such as miniature seem intriguing, but I haven't really gotten into exploring that yet.Overall, the camera has a lot of good features. So why would I give it only three stars? There are at least two things that I would consider design flaws.Battery:Let's start with the battery. This is a so-so issue, some good news and some bad news. The good news is the battery weighs less than the SX10's AA batteries, lasts longer (for about 1000 pictures), and fully recharges in under 2 hours while I often have to let the AAs recharge over night. The bad news is it is much more expensive to get a spare and inconvenient for travel. With the SX10, I could fly overseas and use my mom's batteries and charger in Germany in case I forgot to bring mine. If needed, I could rely on AA batteries being available at a souvenir shop or gas station. With the proprietary battery pack, if I forget to take the charger and 220V adapter with me or don't have anywhere to plug it in, the camera is dead once its battery pack runs out of power. You can't just buy a spare one at a gas station. If you have a spare battery pack in your possession, you have to package it according to TSA safety restrictions on Lithium batteries if you take it on an airplane. So there's a lot more to consider when traveling with this camera. If Canon offered the same camera with the option of using AA batteries, I would probably opt for that instead of the battery pack just for the sake of convenience when traveling.""Manual"" mode limitations:The bigger issue though is that the camera does not have a fully manual mode. Sure, there is the M mode setting, but it has limitations. I noticed it when I took some night shots and the camera changed my ISO setting from 400 to 100 as I increased exposure time in M mode. When I tried to reset the ISO, it told me ""ISO speed is limited due to slow shutter speed."" The camera manual explains under Tv mode that when shutter speeds of 1.3 seconds or slower are used, the ISO speed is fixed to ISO 100. However, there is no warning about it on the page detailing M mode and I did not expect to find any limits in manual setting as it wouldn't really be manual then.I emailed Canon support about it and they clearly did not get what I was asking about, so I called phone support. The guy I talked to was clearly not expecting this limitation either and at first told me I probably had a faulty camera and should send it in. However, he was then able to reproduce the effect on his camera much to his own surprise. He had to check with someone and finally came back with the information that the limitation is built into the firmware by design to ""prevent overexposure and hot pixels on the sensor."" No plans to upgrade the firmware to change that. He recommended cranking up the ISO to 3200 at 1 second exposure. That's not really what I wanted to do though. It's a bit of a joke really, or even insulting, to any photographer who knows what they're doing in M mode.It is possible to get around this limitation using a CHDK hack. However, at this time there is only a buggy alpha version of CHDK available for the SX40. I gave it a try and while the ISO override worked, it wasn't the ISO I had set it for. E.g. setting the override at ISO 400 gave me pictures with ISO 640, and setting it for ISO 800 gave me ISO 1250. Regardless of the option of using CHDK, this limitation is like putting a child lock on M mode and it's a farce to call the resulting feature ""manual mode."" So that is my main disappointment with this camera so far.Instructions:Last but not least, I was also disappointed that Canon does not provide a printed manual with the camera. All you get is a PDF on the accompanying CD. It is set to print in postcard size, which results in a lot of white space and waste of paper when printing it. The resulting binder weighs more than a pound in paper weight. Neither the PDF nor the print out are useful as a reference in the field, at least not for me. The tech support person I talked to quickly promised to get a printed manual sent to me at no charge when I mentioned it though, so a phone call might be all it takes to get one. I haven't received it yet, but when I do I shall report what it looks like.The verdict:Overall, the SX40 is a nice camera with some great features, but unfortunately it is prevented from performing to its full potential by restrictions that Canon designed into the firmware. Canon's ""design"" of locking ISO settings in manual mode is almost an insult to more advanced hobby photographers, and it is clearly misleading to still call it ""manual"" if the camera is allowed to override the photographer's choices in settings. I don't think any other camera model in this quality and price class does that. However, those who do not use M mode routinely will probably hardly notice this limitation.","December 17, 2011",
cameras,"Great picture quality, horrible AF",J. Harley,R3JNNFGR5IE5GQ,3,"Bought this because I needed a compact super-zoom camera. Well, the first surprise was the size. It was a bit larger than I expected. In fact, it's only slightly smaller than a regular Canon DSLR, so if you're buying this to lug around all day instead of a bulky heavy DSLR, you're going to practically carry around the same sized camera (minus a gigantic 800mm zoom lens, so you do shave off some significant lens bulk). Despite the size, there was much to like about the SX40. The image quality was great, even better than a G10 I owned a few years ago. I never bought the G12, so I can't compare the quality to that, but several online forums say the quality is as good or even better than the G12 (these are forum opinions, not mine). The CMOS sensor produced crisp sharp photos with nice color saturation. The video quality was equally as impressive, rivaling my ACVHD camcorder. Sound quality was also great with barely noticeable motor noise when zooming. The biggest problem I encountered, which ultimately caused me to return it, was sporadic auto-focus. In a nutshell, it just missed way too many shots. The worst part is, these were static subjects, not moving targets. Funny thing is, it actually perfectly froze a fast moving shot I took of an automobile but couldn't focus on several still subjects I was trying to photograph in moderate light. The AF just kept hunting but could never find the proper focus. As a result, one-third of my shots were blurry and out of focus despite adequate focal length. Maybe I got a lemon, but a 66% success rate was unacceptable. I tried numerous times to adjust but the camera was just too temperamental. It's a shame because I really liked the camera other than that one flaw. I've read about random AF issues with the latest Canon HS cameras. I guess you just have to get lucky and get a good one. As for me, my search for a compact super zoom replacement continues.","April 4, 2012",
cameras,Great and Not So Great,M. Tarallo,RKG16OUAYAFKM,3,"I've been using Canon cameras for over 30 years and have loved every one of them, from video to professional SLR to compact digital. The SX super zoom cameras have proven to be a convenient alternate choice to carrying an SLR with an array of lenses. The SX40 is outstanding in picture quality and has probably the longest zoom lens in its field. I would normally have given this camera a 5 star rating if not for a few disappointments in this version. Most annoying is the hissing sound that occurs when zooming while shooting a movie. It ruins every movie where ambient noise is minimal. Don't know what happened with Canon because this was not a problem in earlier models. The other disappointment is no wireless remote capability. Canon chose to add this feature to a few of its previous cameras, but it is not on the SX40. Wireless remote has come in handy many times for me. If you can live with these deficiencies, you've got an awesome camera. Otherwise, I would suggest the Canon SX1 IS, if you can still find it. The zoom is only 20x, but still outstanding . . . and quiet! And it does have wireless remote capability.","February 20, 2012",
cameras,"Great camera, but enough flaws to preclude ""excellent""",RoninUT,R2TJ8PMPQ0PTI4,3,"I read many reviews before purchasing this camera, so I was already aware of most of its limitations. However, there are some things that really need to be experienced firsthand to understand fully.This camera is a bridge camera, and I bought it to bridge the gap between my pocket cameras (sx130is) and my dslr (rebel xs). In that regard it is a bittersweet compromise across the board.The pocket camera doesnt limit ISO speeds with 1 second or longer Tv like the sx40hs, nor does the rebel xs. The 1080p video is really nice to have, so that puts the sx40hs ahead of the rebel xs in that regard. But even the sx130is does 720p video and the rebel xs does not do video at all.So to focus on the camera at issue:Things I liked...Stereo mics1080p videoAuto exposure bracketing to enable HDR photographyTwo user configured custom modesArticulating screenLong zoomSlow motion video modeHot shoeThings I didnt like...Lack of depth of field preview buttonBayonet mount instead of threads for mounting filtersNo ext. microphone jackElectronic viewfinder resolution is poorNoisy focusingDifficulty focusing at longer end of zoom rangeRequires locking exposure before shifting aperture/shutter values in program modeCrippled manual mode with arbitrary factory imposed ISO limitationLack of sunset and stars modes in creative zoneProprietary batteryNo battery grips availableNo waterproof housing availableAll in all I really like the added flexibility this camera gives over the pocket cameras. Its still small enough to pack around. I will take more pictures simply by virtue of not having to drag a camera bag with multiple lenses and accessories around. But it will not replace a true slr anytime soon. The proprietary battery is less convenient becuase it will require purchasing a spare to carry along to ensure no interruption in shooting. The ISO limitation is annoying, but the situations for which it becomes limiting are infrequent enough for the pictures I like to take that it didn't deter me from buying. The biggest disappointments were the image quality of the electronic viewfinder, and the strange fiddly requirement that you lock the xposure value before shifting shutter/aperture values in program mode. No matter though, it just forces me to decide whether depth of field or freezing (or blurring) motion is the priority, and I choose Av or Tv modes and adjust accordingly.One particularly nice feature that I wasnt expecting was the two user configured custom modes. I have one set for auto exposure bracketing of two stops either side of the metered exposure and just dial it in when I want to take an HDR image. I also wish the camera would accept threaded filters directly instead of relying on an adapter. The bayonet mount is a nice way to attach a lens hood but even with post processing eliminating the need for almost every filter, a lot of us like to keep a UV filter in place to protect the lens, and there are still plenty of situations where you will want a neutral density filter to allow a longer exposure under bright conditions.Overall I'm happy with the camera and will learn to work within it's limitations while appreciating the creative options it affords in other areas, and will use it a lot more than my dslr just because it is easier to bring along.UPDATE 3/25/2013After using this camera for a few months I wanted to give a little update. There are some things that really I have discovered through long term use that I might not have noticed in my excitement over a new toy, and some capabilities I wasn't aware of. Overall my 3 star rating stays the same, because the nice things are still tainted by a few flaws. The shutter lag is undeniable, and it makes it impossible to capture a fleeting expression on my daughter's face. If the Camera can't capture the exact moment you see the instant you press the shutter button, it sevsrely limits it's usefulness for any kind of action photography. I still a great camera for posed portraits, landscapes, and things that hold still. But it is going to frustrate you trying to take pictures of things that move. You will develop your ability to anticipate what is going to happen next in a scene and try to get ahead of it with this camera.On the other hand, as I mentioned earlier in my review about the custom settings, that is a tremendous advantage! I have one of the presets set up just like (P) rogram mode, but with a smaller image size. So when I want to snap a quick low resolution image to share online I can just dial to that preset. For HDR it has really been great. Almost all my HDR is shot from a tripod so I have the image stabilizer turned off, auto exposure bracketing set to two stop spread, and the ISO set to 100 among other things. I don't have to remember the settings, just dial in the present and it remembers everything. I love is feature and it is great for anyone who has a very specific settings formula they need to access often without manually setting each function every time.","November 4, 2012",
cameras,Decent photos - TERRIBLE shutter lag,B. Larson,R2Q0VHPZRJST6K,3,"I bought this as a nice, portable, do-all camera. It works fine for scenic shots & landscapes, and also posed people shots. The problem comes when I try to take casual, candid snapshots of people, especially kids. When you try to catch that moment of peak smile (or otherwise perfect expression or action), you click the shutter release. After what seems like an eternity (okay, maybe a slight exaggeration), the shutter finally releases, capturing the moment a second or two later. That may not seem like much, but when you want to get a good, natural smile, that lag ruins it. I'm probably spoiled by my Canon 20D that I've had for awhile now. I know, you get what you pay for. But I'm a loyal Canon fan, and thought this camera would be perfect. Turns out, it's useless for people & action. But, to be fair, landscapes, scenics, and non-moving wildlife shots are great with this.","October 26, 2012",
cameras,Good...but not the best superzoom...,Gladius,R1GTZQGRHWIX2B,3,"Many reviews I read (Canon or not) compare a new model to an old one made by the same manufacturer. I don't find these reviews very helpful.For example, the SX40 is better than the SX30. I'm glad it is (better sensor, Digic 5) and it's an excellent camera. 35x is really very impressive (Note: Be ready to sometimes use a tripod if you get this due to blur --- not unexpected at 35x! :-). Pics are usually remarkably free of blur. Colors are good. IQ is good. IS is good. (Overall, good picture quality and average video/audio.)I love Canon. But the Panasonic FZ150 has all of the above (except 24x lens) and more. It's faster. The EVF is better. Video is better (1080 x24p vs. 1080 x60p for the Panasonic --- and more control). The screen is 460,000 not an outdated 230,000 and a bit larger. Battery life is somewhat better. OIS is even better than that on the SX40. It has RAW. (Note: Both cameras are better than the Nikon P500/510.) (I've used all of them.)The Panasonic does cost somewhat more but resale would be better and the Panasonic should not be out of date for quite a while.I don't really want to spend about $489 on a P&S;, no matter how good. But it's not being discounted for a reason. And best to get it right the first time.In this case the FZ150 is the best superzoom out there. I advise trying both before making your decision (the SX40 is right now significantly cheaper). Don't be tied to any one brand! (And I do consider Canon the best brand overall.) Look at the brand (reliability, customer service) and the camera.","May 3, 2012",

The video is also sharp, and I get a ton of complements on my photos. However, after 16 months, my photos are blurry unless I hold the camera very steady with both hands and hold my breath. 90% of the time I use the camera in Auto so it should not be this complicated! I took photography classes at an art college and am a reporter so I am not a new photographer. I have never seen this issue on any camera in 20 years - yet my friend/camera geek told me that he has also had recent problems with his Canons so something is slipping in the quality control department.FYI, I am having the same problem with another Canon that is a smaller size, but also about 1.5 years old and lost some really important pictures last week when I gave the camera to a friend in Auto. I tried to explain please hold the camera really steady, but all of the photos by friends came back blurry :(I called Canon, and they said it would cost $160 just to find out what is wrong with this camera, and $100 to find out what is wrong with the smaller Cannon.

cameras,Electric viewfinder,John Sheppard,R2QX05IAYLN8OY,3,"While it is a very good camera for what it is intended to do, it has flaws. The screen resolution of the monitor is very poor for this type camera. My Canon S-95 is worlds ahead of the SX-40 monitor. Next disappointment is the Electric Viewfinder. It is incredibly DIM!! Almost useless in bright sunlight. Again, my Canon S-95 out shown this camera with its brighter monitor! How could this be??!! This is an ADVANCED camera! The only reason I bought the SX-40 was for the wonderful zoom range. I like to isolate my subjects and a 24-840 zoom range allows me to really get close. However at extreme ranges, you MUST have a steady platform, a brace or a tripod, anything to steady the camera. You will see what I mean if you buy the camera and try and hold it steady! But that is expected. Know its and your limitations. The image quality is very good. And remember: Most people never have a print made bigger than a 4 X 6 anyway!! IF they even bother to have prints made. Most people just look at their photos on their PC. So this is a good choice for many folks who don't NEED anything more than an all in one camera.","November 7, 2011",
cameras,"Like this camera, however a few issues. Maybe someone can help",Suzie Snowflake,R297H8LUKLF68N,3,"I bought this camera in November. I am happy with the zoom for sure. Not happy with indoor people shots. They are either yellow or pale. People's face color is either yellow or pale also. Distortion with sizes of surrounding things is not good either. When I want to crop, the cropped image is not crisp (all types of pics). I really thought this camera was going to be the bomb. I owned a SX210IS which took better pics than this for cropping and with indoor lighting. I have changed the settings to tungsten while shooting with fluorescent lighting. It got rid of the yellow, but looks flat and just not right. Can't put my finger on it. I do not know terribly much about settings. I do know that the SX210IS worked perfectly on auto, this one does not at all.","January 8, 2012",
cameras,I am done with Canon.,Ash,R12H5CVDKQ4XOY,3,"I read in one of the reviews that this particular model of Canon does closeups nicely. I have already returned SX150 a few weeks back to Best Buy. This camera is much more expensive than SX150. I really was not expecting much other than to be able to take closeup pictures in low light. My wife makes jewellery and she needed this camera to take closeup pictures of the jewellery. Let me explain the difference between Macro Photography and zooming. Both relate to closeups. In macro photography, the camera is very close to the physical object and the optical lenses do most of the work. This camera is great for that, and so was SX150. When I placed the camera, two to three feet apart from the object and try to zoom in, I could never get it to focus in Automatic as well as manual mode. The best test you can do it to sit on a chair and spread your legs, and try to focus on your toe. I am so disappointed that my five year old Canon had the same symptoms and we are still stuck at the same place even today.So, for me, it's Goodbye Canon!

I am not a camera expert and I never got an actual manual with my camera so it is possible I am not taking advantage of the features correclty. I am a bit annoyed mine came without a manual.

cameras,Not a substitute for a DSLR,Richard F. Colarco,RQBMBY9KP6XNF,3,"As a high-end point-and-shoot, this camera is pretty decent. It is pushing the performance envelope in so many places, the total effect is somewhat diluted.You can take good pictures with this camera, if you can accept its limitations. At long focal lengths, the image stabilization certainly works. However, if you attempt to use high ISO to give a hand-holdable shutter speed in any but bright light, the noise in the tiny pixels dominates. Keep the mode dial in ""P,"" keep the ISO at 400 or below (200 is better), and use a good support.The on-camera flash is better than nothing, but the ability to use a dedicated Canon flash sold me on the camera.There is a lot of lag in the viewfinder image. Writing to the memory card is slow (I think I need a faster card), so repeat shots are delayed. Taking pictures of moving subjects is annoying almost to the point of uselessness.The LCD display is pretty good, and is visible in bright light.My Rebel Xti is not a lot bigger or heavier, and shoots rings around this camera. However, the SX40 is a decent buy, and a good camera for people who are unreasonably terrified of DSLRs (you know who you are).","September 2, 2012",
cameras,Back to 2003,Core,R1BC28XY9219IO,3,"The picture and video quality is nice. The amount of coverage from 24mm to 840mm is incredible. But I had to return it. My objective was to shoot sports. Even with the fastest Sandisk Pro the slow buffer lag time in between frames failed to keep up with the action. The burst mode is only good if the subject is not moving across the screen. (Golf swings and tennis serves) For field sports, by the time the screen came back on, the action was long gone. The screen blackening out momentarily reminds me of early digital cameras when they first came out. The lens focus-hunts too frequently on the long end. This is one step forward and two steps back for Canon. You'll see the price on this drop quickly. The local Frys this week has it for $299.","May 4, 2012",

I have a Panasonic fx18 right now that is 4 years old and it stops motion better than this camera. Even with image stabilization on I am having sever issues with blur especially when you start to use more of the zoom. I have issues with the shutter as there is too much time between when the button to take a picture is pressed and the actual shot.

cameras,Ok while it lasted,"P. Reese ""muncie-birder""",R18BOBZ7BV3JRB,3,"Had this camera for 2 years before the zoom stopped working. My main complaint of this camera is that it will not always focus on the subject you are attempting to shoot. If a camera has a 35x zoom, it would help greatly if the thing would focus on the object one is trying to shoot. Birds in trees are especially difficult. More apt to focus on some limb than on the bird. When it does focus, it takes superb photos--about 1/2 the time at max zoom. Before this one I had a Canon SX10. It too stopped working after about 2 years. I think that must be built onto the design of the camera so that Canon can sell replacements every 2 years.","September 2, 2012",

The only thing i didn't like about the panasonic was the ZOOM (24X vs 35X), even though i am not sure i needed the extra zoom for now. Sony HX100v was another good option but decided on panasonic based on the glowing review.

But I didn't do my homework, and overestimated Canon's competence. I ended up having the return my SX40. One of the best things about this series of cameras has always been the use of 4 AA batteries. This gives tremendous freedom, using those wonderful Eneloop rechargables most of the time, but being able to throw in regular AAs in a pinch. Being reliant on a proprietary battery pack is just silly. I also made the mistake of assuming Canon had fixed its lack of an external mike input. In these days, when we're all posting videos to YouTube for business or for fun, not being able to plug in a shotgun mike seriously compromises the video value of this camera.

The grip on the right front was shallow for my finger grasp and I don't have large hands. The top of the grip should have had a more pronounced finger stop. It had only a shallow one. The grip surface didn't have a sure grip rubber feel like Nikon and other cameras of similer value. I felt it could easily dropped at any time. The electronic viewer was indeed, too small and I just didn't think the overall look of the camera, was as snazzy as the Nikon sitting next to it.

In the end, the ZS20 just didn't deliver there. The photos were never sharp indoors, even when people were perfectly still.The reason I'm so disappointed is that there is so much else to love. The 20X zoom is incredible...I got cool close-ups I never could have otherwise. The camera is FAST - it's ready for the next photo immediately. On the touch screen you can touch the spot where you want to focus and even take the shot just from pressing it. Other features like face recognition, panorama modes and macro modes worked were cool.The IA (Intelligent Auto) mode worked very well for me. Most of the time the camera quickly detected the best settings for the shot. An example was my kids...I was taking photos of them when they put a bunch of flowers close to the lens -- it immediately went into macro mode and took a great photo of the flowers.Indoors, the color quality of still shots was great, but it was the PEOPLE that never came out crisply.Outdoors, photos were amazing, but a lot of cameras are.I borrowed a Nikon Coolpix P300 to try out...and it just took those critical indoor shots better. I compared them side-by-side. If I was traveling and outdoors more I would keep the Lumix -- there are SO many other features on the Lumix ZS20 that I love, but if I'm always going to be disappointed by my indoor photos of people, I just can't keep it.","May 31, 2012",

I tried out my new ZS20 at my grand niece's christening and took pictures of my family and wow, all the pictures came out beautiful and the videos were great, better than my ZS6. The thing I notice though is that pictures came out a little soft, even in bright sunlight and with flash. This might be OK for other people but not for me; I like my pictures sharp. I looked at old pictures that I took with my ZS6 and the pictures are sharper. The other thing that I noticed with the ZS20 is that it doesn't have the Picture Adjustment mode where you can adjust the contrast, sharpness, saturation and noise reduction. I use the sharpness adjustment a lot with my ZS6 when taking pictures of flowers and scenery. The sharpness adjustment on the ZS20 would have solved this issue and I wouldn't have to return the camera. I got it for a very good price too, $269. It's a shame.I wish Panasonic would put back the Picture Adjustment mode to next year's model and increase the megapixels on the still images from video to at least 5 or 7 megs. The 3.5 megapixel images taken from the video are too soft also. I'm gonna hold on to my ZS6 for now.","June 6, 2012",

It isn't bad quality, but the same as you might find in a lower end different brand model.- You have to switch a button to toggle between taking pictures and reviewing pictures. At the surface this sounds trivial, but after a few months use I find it annoying. Each time you toggle the lens retracts and there is a few second delay. This becomes annoying if you take a picture and want to have a quick look at it before snapping another. You have to retract the lens, find the picture then expand the lens again before you can take another picture. Seems most other brands let you preview quickly while taking pictures, I am just not happy with the extra time it takes with this model.","January 2, 2013",

My issue with this camera is that it allows you to select the fineness (size) of the image. The lowest setting is .3M and the highest is 14.1M. We use this camera for documentation purposes and store the pictures with client records. 14.1M (nearly 14 MB per picture) of detail takes up too much space as we take around 100 pictures per client, but .3 MP is not enough to record the detail. My issue is that the next setting after .3M is 5M. That's like 16 times larger or about 5 MB per picture. It would be nice if there were a setting in the 1M range.

Had an earlier version (3.0) that was simple, easy to use, fast, and effective (but had a glitch on my computer that couldn't be fixed). This program is SLOW; takes more than a minute just to open, requires repetitive and duplicative clicks for what should be one or two step processes.

The camera loses all charge when you leave it charging too long. It beeps to warn you when it already happened... honestly this is a HUGE FLAW. When I charge any device, I wanna leave it there til I'm ready to use it, not 'til it dies and is worthless. (I am charging on my computer's USB port by the way)2. The software that comes with the camera to sync is in my opinion complete crap. It doesn't know what pictures you already synced... When I sync all of them hoping it will realize what I already sync'd, it has no idea, copies all of them and adds (2) on the end of the file name. I might as well copy using Windows explorer.3. The shutter speed/picture taking speed is not that impressive for me-- I'm trying to take pictures of my dog and they turn out as a blur. I don't always want to switch to the burst setting to accomplish this.4. As an amateur using this point-and-shoot, I've noticed that any setting other than ""Intelligent Auto"" results in fuzzy pictures for me.

Amazon customer service is great, they are sending me a replacement because I really would like this camera to work out, but I will see if the next one has the same result. What is the point of keeping a camera that will take dusty photos? And I do not want to rip it a part and have to clean it myself. Sounds like an engineering defect to me. I called Panasonic. They suggested I send it the brand new camera to have it cleaned by them. No thanks. I will see how the replacement is. If it is the same end result I will just return the camera for a refund if not I will keep it. Like I said I really love this camera and researched for over a month before buying it. I really don't like the comparable Sony, or the Canon models. I will leave a more detailed edited review later.","November 7, 2012",
cameras,some modest issues,"Fred Clancey ""Fred Clancey""",R1WXL7PNTEE26T,3,"According to p. 128 of Panasonic's instruction manual (included in the DVD) the camera's gps may not work in the presence of another device operating in the 1.5GHZ band which includes iphone 4s. Iphone 4 operates at 1.0GHz. I see (via google ;) some 1, 1.2 and 1.5 GHz android phones out there but that's not an exhaustive search.An obvious attraction of this camera is the amazingly small form factor that accomdates a 20x optical zoom. But one of the ways a small form factor was enabled is a very small battery which wouldn't be a large drawback if Panasonic had provided another method for charging the battery. But the travel chargers I've ordered AC Wall Charger + Car Charger Adapter for Panasonic DMC-FX700, DMC-FX75, DMC-ZR1, DMC-ZS1, DMC-ZS3, DMC-ZS5, DMC-ZX1, TZ6, TZ7 will hopefully work or ...

cameras,Software provided with camera doesn't work,bascar,R10H2KD4XUWY4R,3,"After owning this camera for more than a year, we recorded some videos. The PhotoFun Studio software provided with the camera can't find the videos on the camera. You have to use ""my computer"" on the PC and treat the camera as an external drive. The videos will be hidden in a folder named ""Private"", and then you can transfer them to your computer. Even worse, the .mts format used by the camera to record videos cannot be viewed using the Quicktime program provided with the camera. I can play .mts using the Windows Media Player on my Windows 7 machine, but have to convert the .mts files to .avi format to run on my XP machine. BTW, the .avi format conversion won't play properly on my Window 7 machine, so I need two different video files, one for each operating system! And my friends with Macs are still trying to find something that works.Boo on Panasonic for providing software that will not work with the camera, and forces camera owners to find back-door methods to get the darn thing to work.","October 15, 2013",

But yesterday, just 20 days into using it, a Christmas present, the lens cover stopped fully retracting -- it would stick halfway, leaving just a slit exposed for the lens. Multiple recycling of the power fixed it the first time around, but it happened again the next time it was powered up.Think this is an anomaly in just this camera and that it is not a design or manufacturing fault. I own multiple Panasonics.Returned it today for a replacement. As ever doing so with Amazon was slick and painless. UPS just picked up the return.Just a heads up.","January 14, 2013",

First, the firmware update to v1.1 (for handheld night shots): I followed the instructions on the Panasonic website carefully, yet the update did not succeed. It said it would not work if the battery was not fully charged, so I charged it for 24 hours, still no luck. Secondly, the GPS failed to acquire satellites in more than 2 days of testing. I put the camera on a south-facing windowsill, with almost half of the sky visible, (although it WAS cloudy), again no luck.Pictures are ok, although low light shots show a lot of noise, as you would expect.

Only problem I ran into was when the pictures were taken in night time under ambient light conditions (like standard living room lighting), there was a wierd shadow/silhoutte that just wont go away. Pictures taken using flash in pitch dark are actually much better than standard evening light conditions. I tried changing memory cards, tried to look up if anyone else had this issues (which I could not find any, may be my search was not good enough).

cameras,"vulnerable lens - to dust, to breaking. great video capability though. i'll miss that.",. .,R1AN0YYA3TASBT,3,"first mega zoom compact I've had, and was very impressed. Video using zoom was also fabulous, and the ability to take still shots while zoomed and videoing also great! unlike other compacts i've had, video was smooth and didn't noticably refocus while recording, and zoom was easily usable (again without noticable refocusing, or hearing the zoom motor - both of which were really annoying problems with a mid-high range canon compact I had before this). photos look crisp, colors vibrant if lighting was right.why only three stars?- often washed out if there was too much light.- colors run ""cool"" - I prefer warmer colors and less contrast. unless you are into tweaking camera settings, it's quite contrasty. and deals with purple worse than any other compact camera I've had.- after I had the camera a few months (right after the Costco return period, of course), there was a speck of dust inside somewhere that was in the middle of every shot. no cheap solution to that.- somehow that piece of dust dislodged itself (it was way in the lenses somewhere, not accessible to canned air or a brush), something at the bottom was wrong... bottom of what? I don't know official terms. basically, every photo (taken with the camera in normal/horizontal position) had a slanted black lower edge. when I zoom, it's a thicker edge. something in there loosened out of place. it seems like a fragile camera.I dropped it and the lens won't open. sometimes it will if I jiggle it manually while as it tries to open when the camera is turned on. so unreliable now and useless. so I've bought a new camera (Fuji) with wonderful warm colors, generally much better photos, though less ""sharp"" looking as they aren't as contrasty as the Lumix. fine with me. but video is not as good as the lumix.so pick your battles or find a better overall camera.","November 27, 2013",

cameras,my new TZ30,Eniko,R2Q5I1III82G1T,3,"I was very exited to get the newest Panasonic Lumix TZ30. I purchased the TZ1 six years ago when the that was the first 10x zoom small camera and I was happy with it. I like to take pictures of birds and wild animals and the 20x zoom and the small size was the deciding factor. I read a lot of the reviews about similar cameras and this seemed to be the best, but it still has a lot of room for improvement.I like the zoom and it works well in bright light and even got a decent photo of the full moon free hand. In low light is much worse than I expected. I liked the idea that it can take 2-3 pictures automatically to compensate for the strong back light - until I found people with two noses and missing arm. The macro is very good. I like the wide angle. The skin tones need improvement.I didn't have a chance to try all the possibilities, I am still learning. The buttons on the TZ1 were easier to navigate.I know I cannot expect the same quality as the big cameras get and I wouldn't want one of those but I still hope to get a better camera in the future.","June 24, 2012",

cameras,Panasonic Lumix ZS20 14.1 MP High Sensitivity MOS Digital Camera with 20X Zoom,Ralph Furlong,R2LF8EC6MK0PMU,3,"This is a very difficult review to write as there are two major components to it. On the one side, there is the software and Panasonic Support and on the other side there is the actual camera itself. First, let me deal with the software, Firmware updates, and Panasonic Support. Here are my thoughts on that front: 1. The included software for the camera does NOT work on Windows 8. It is NOT supported on Windows 8 and there is apparently no intention of supporting Windows 8. Here is a direct quote from Panasonic support once I finally managed to find a way to contact them:There is no PhotoFunStudio 1.8 update program for Windows 8 compatibility. We are sorry for any inconvenience.Thank you for contacting Panasonic.This is the software that you are supposed to use to connect your camera to your computer, control advanced functions, work with your pictures, etc. So, forget any value on that front. The software also appears to have issues loading on Windows 7 64 bit OS. 2. If you go to the Panasonic Website and try to download updates, you will find a very interesting mess. First, there is an endless loop that if you select the correct camera for support takes you directly to the sales site for you to purchase the camera. Click on ""support"" and you go right back to the sales site. In order to get anywhere, you need to select the wrong camera (anything other than this black ZS20). Depending upon which one you select, you will see that there is a firmware update to correct issues with the GPS. However, do not try to click on the explanation on what the update is for or how to install it as it will take you right back to the sales site so you can purchase the camera!If you click directly on the download, it might take you to the download for the firmware or it might give you a ""location not found"". 3. If you finally find your way to e-mail support, it does allow you sort of fill in the blanks with whatever your issue might be. Once submitted, I received a response in a very short order. I was asked to provide the exact verbiage of the error message, so I sent in a screen shot of the message. Forget that! You get an error response from Panasonic stating that your message exceeds their allowed e-mail size!!!!Once I typed in the exact message detail, I received a response from their technical support person who said to go ahead and load the software even though the warning message states that the OS is NOT compatible and that even if you do manage to load it, it will not function correctly. They told me to load it anyway and then contact them with whatever problems that causes!!!!When I wrote back and stated that I was not happy with this, the tech pointed out that this camera came onto the market in 2012 before Windows 8 . Well, Windows 8 also launched in 2012 and that is a lousy excuse! Why are you still selling the camera then if you will not support it?Ok, enough with this section, let's get on to the actual Camera review: Here is what I liked: 1. The camera is very light weight and they added a rubber section to the camera grip that makes it easier to hold. 2. The 20X optics is very nice and it appears to work well. 3. The move into the digital expansion that takes the camera to 40X is very smooth and the camera stabilization works well. Pictures taken of an object in the rain that was 6 feet away came out very clear and the rain drop that I was focusing on was very detailed.Here are some items that I did not like as much: 1. Many of the features are not intuitively obvious and will take some time to learn. As an example, try to locate the function to format the card! 2. Touch features seem a little erratic. 3. The time to first shot appears to be much longer than the information on the website indicates it should be.As long as this camera does not malfunction and you do not want any software, it should be a reasonable camera. I do not, however, have a lot of faith that if something goes wrong it would be repaired.","March 3, 2014",

Really great.But, compared to the ZS7 it is simply soft - and I tried two to make sure I did not have a bad one.

Well, it seems that their's looks like an industry standard micro USB plug but it's proprietory and can't be bought locally.

cameras,"Perfectly Nice, Just Not For Me",A. Ansley,R3EKKIFCCA53XV,3,"My quick back-story. I am a smartphone attic and typically have the most up-to-date gadget phone. When I got the iPhone 4S last year, I was thrilled with it, especially the camera. Why would I ever need a regular camera!? Its pictures are gorgeous! I took it to Europe last Christmas and it was my dedicated camera. Really useful! How were the pictures? Really awful! If it was bright outside, the iPhone did great. If it was dreary, and in London & Hamburg it certainly was, the pictures were grainy, soft, and any movement completely ruined the photo. I still kick myself for not taking a better camera. A lot of really great moments were lost.Enter in the Lumix ZS20. Portability is a must and low-light performance is a must. Those are my 2 things. This camera certainly does better in low-light, much better than a phone. The zoom is fantastic. The touch-to-focus is really nice & fast. I really had no complaints about it. But if I'm going to carry around a dedicated camera, it sure better be a step-up from my phone, right? I recently got the Galaxy S3 and pitted it against my old iPhone 4S. It was roughly the same, picture quality wise. When the Lumix ZS20 arrived, I took it out after a few days and compared it against my wonderful new point & shoot. How did it do? The pictures were beautiful! Much more saturated than the pictures coming out of my smartphone. The colors really popped. However, and especially at 100% crop, I realized they were really no better than the Galaxy camera. I was kind of flummoxed. Have phones really come that far? If I turned up the saturation/color on the phone, the pictures would be nearly identical.I was lost. After *a lot* more research, I decided to step it up to something a little less pocketable, but something that would offer better quality pictures. I went with the Panasonic Lumix DMC-GF3 12 MP Micro 4/3 Compact System Camera with 3-Inch Touchscreen LCD and 14-42mm Zoom Lens (Black), of the mirrorless variety. I just got back from a weekend in NYC and snapped over 500 pictures with the GF3. It looks like it's here to stay. Beautiful pictures that have really great detail. Easily a few steps above the ZS20 and my myriad of smart phones.I have no major complaints with the ZS20, but look out point & shoots, with the quality cameras coming in smart phones now, I think your time on this Earth might be coming to a close.","October 15, 2012",
cameras,Outrageous design flaws,Eric,R1FJKBY77Y9Q0P,3,"So far, a very good camera with lots of features at a great price. BUT! There are two flagrant design flaws.1) Look at the photo of the camera. The lens barrel is placed essentially flush with the side of the camera, which makes it nearly impossible to get any grip with one's finger on the front of the camera, something necessary both to hold it steady and to prevent it slipping and falling. My previous Lumix wasn't built this way.2) The battery charger. It consists of an AC adapter that MUST be connected to the camera via a USB cable. And not just any USB cable, according to Panasonic, but only the one provided. This has multiple disadvantages. First, it becomes impossible to use the camera while it is charging (switch one battery for another). Second, the cable is short, so you either have to be lucky and have a table or something near an outlet on which to lie the camera or you have to put it on the floor and hope nobody steps on it. Third, woe! to you if you lose the cable or even forget to take it with you wherever you go.Who dreamed up this idiocy? The previous Lumix had a small AC adapter that was self-contained with a compartment for the battery being charged. It also had prongs that neatly folded away when not in use. Why not have left well enough alone?","May 5, 2014",

cameras,20x Zoom Comparison - Sony HX20; Canon SX260; Panasonic ZS19,Artemaria,R33NQZMVW4NA2G,3,"I couldn't decide between these three cameras (and their variants, the Sony HX30 and the Panasonic ZX20) because many of the reviews of each made the cameras sound very similar. So, I went out and bought (from merchants who accepted returns) one of each of these three cameras (I didn't need WI-FI or GPS, so that's how I settled on these less expensive variants). And then I took photos and videos in various conditions. I am not a professional photographer, and I didn't do Imatest or any other specific tests on the images (you can read C/net for that), but this is an experience of a regular person who was taking pictures and videos with these three cameras side by side, which is a comparison that you do not often see.The bottom line is that these three cameras are very similar with a few minor differences, but those differences set them apart and may make you decide that you like one more than the other.Generally speaking, NONE of these cameras is a DSLR replacement. Whomever writes that the pictures are as good as a DSLR is not speaking accurately. Also, none of the cameras is a replacement for a high end camcorder.OUTSIDE PICTURESIf you are taking pictures outside on a sunny day all of these cameras will take very nice pictures for small to medium enlargements (no bigger than 8 x 10). The cameras all produce nice fairly sharp images that would be well suited for that purpose. And, like most people, I don't remember ever enlarging a picture more than 8 x 10, so it is not a common problem.What might be an issue is if you are zoomed in all the way and wanted to crop a photo (which sometimes happens), the differences in the way the cameras' photos look when you ""pixel peep"" might make a difference. In good light outside, the cameras were close, but the best photos were from the CANON with the SONY and the PANASONIC a close second.INSIDE PICTURES - GOOD LIGHTIf you are inside and you are taking pictures in low light, you will see a different story. Again, at smaller sized prints 4x6, 5x7, most people will see almost no difference between the pictures of the three cameras other than the PANASONIC's colors are a little less vibrant than those in the CANON and the SONY. I am not sure whether those colors are less accurate, they are just a little less vivid.If you pixel peep at these pictures, the CANON's photos are clearly the best with the PANASONIC's being second. The CANON's remain very sharp through a good amount of enlargement while the PANASONIC's, although close, get softer a little faster. The SONY's pictures inside with good light became soft rather quickly and, I'm not sure if this is because the SONY has 18MP on a small chip (as some of the tech reviewers write), but there is a ""watercolor"" effect where after you enlarge it a little bit, it looks like a Claude Manet painting.INSIDE PICTURES - LOW LIGHTIn poor light, the hierarchy between the cameras remains the same, but there is less of a gap between the CANON and the PANASONIC. It seems as if the CANON takes somewhat worse pictures in low light, and the PANASONIC just doesn't get that much worse. As a result, the gap between these two becomes somewhat closer. The SONY's pictures remain the poorest of the three in low light.VIDEO - OUTSIDE GOOD LIGHTAll three cameras take very nice video outside in good light. If you are editing or nitpicky, you will note that the SONY and the PANASONIC take 60 frames per second, which is somewhat easier to edit, than the 24 frames per second that the CANON records. While you have to look for it, the CANON's outside video does have a couple of instances where it seems to be a tad jerky compared to the SONY and PANASONIC's video. But you really have to look for it and most people won't notice if you don't have another video outside for comparison.While all the outdoor video is close, I would give the edge to the SONY in video, with the PANASONIC second and the CANON third. But they are close for outside video.VIDEO - INSIDETaking video inside is a different story. Inside, the SONY shines and clearly has the best video. The video from this camera is actually good. It is not professional level by any stretch, but it is good solid quite viewable video from a camera that takes still pictures.There is a noticeable difference on indoor video between the SONY and the PANASONIC. This difference was perhaps most noticeable to me because I had both videos from both cameras and watched them over and over again looking for differences. While the difference is noticeable, it is not a tremendous difference. The SONY video is super smooth and seems to get as much out of the light as it can. The PANASONIC video also is smooth and gets a good contrast tone and color out of the available light, but is slightly less smooth than the SONY. The PANASONIC video is still very viewable and looks good, but not as good as the SONY.The CANON will take decent indoor video in good light, but in poor light, it just seems to struggle. The CANON's video had many shadows and dark areas that simply were not present in the SONY and PANASONIC videos. I did not notice any hissing in the CANON video as some of the other reviewers have mentioned. This may be an issue that varies from camera to camera.HANDLING AND SPEEDThis was a fairly subjective comparison between the three cameras as to how they felt in the hand and how quickly the camera did what I wanted it to do because if the camera doesn't take the shot when you want to, it doesn't really matter how sharp the picture or video might be.Based on my experience, the PANASONIC had the best handling of the three. While the PANASONIC and the SONY were both quick to take a picture, for some reason the SONY that I had would take a much longer time (seconds) to record the picture onto the card. This was despite the fact that both cameras had comparable cards with comparable write speeds. Both the SONY and the PANASONIC had rather quick autofocus which also made them seem to react faster. The PANASONIC is noticeably thinner and lighter than the SONY while maintaining a similar full raised rubber grip on the front which made the camera easier to handle. While both the SONY and the PANASONIC were quick, the blazingly fast (by comparison) write speeds on the PANASONIC compared with its almost non-existent shutter lag made this the best handling camera of the three by far.Even though it consistently took the best pictures, the CANON was the worst handling camera. The autofocus often had issues focusing and there was a constant shutter lag while it was searching for its focus. We did miss some shots because the CANON was so slow to react. Also, the CANON is somewhere in weight between the SONY and the PANASONIC, but has the worst grip of the three. That little rubber strip on the front is not as effective a grip as the fuller grip that appears on the SONY and the PANASONIC.With respect to handling, I've read many reviews and each of them seems to state different things about each of the cameras. Many of these reviews seem to indicate that the SONY is a very fast camera, and that might be the case, but the write speed of the 18 MP pictures (which are 50% larger than the CANON's photos and almost the same for the PANASONIC) was so slow, it was distracting and detracted from the experience of using the camera.VERDICT AND CONCLUSIONSNone of these cameras is the best at everything. The CANON has the best pictures, but is slow to focus, somewhat awkward to handle and has the worst video of the three. The SONY handles okay but is heavy and has noticeably slow write speeds, its picture quality varies greatly with the light (and will deteriorate rapidly with any significant cropping) but the SONY has the best video, and it is noticeable.In the end I decided to go with the PANASONIC. While it only was the best in handling, to me that was a significant portion of the photographic experience. It is not DSLR fast (instantaneous), but it is a zippy camera for a superzoom, is light in weight and has a good grip which makes it easier to hold. Also, it does not have a pop-up flash which I found always seemed to come up under my fingers where I was holding the left side camera. As noted above, the PANASONIC's videos were good, perhaps not as good as the SONY, but the PANASONIC was certainly capable of capturing some nice video, even in low light. The photos also were not as good as the CANON's, but they were close and very close in low light. With respect to the vibrancy of the colors, if you set the photo vibrancy on the PANASONIC to ""happy"" (which I guess is their ""vivid"") it is less of a noticeable difference. The photos look very nice and certainly are competitive in quality for this type of camera.Hopefully this comparison and these observations will help you decide between these three similar cameras so you can choose the best one for your needs. Good luck.","September 27, 2012",
cameras,Great Travel Camera! BUT I HAD A PROBLEM WITH THE VIDEO,"Bruce A. Moon ""ESLBruce""",R125234EBSOZ9Z,3,"I am revising my review because I just returned the camera to Canon. On reviewing the videos taken in quiet rooms, I found that I had clicks and whirs. Perhaps it is something about the autofocus mechanism but a properly designed microphone shouldn't be picking up internal sounds.The quality of the video, apart from the sound, is excellent. The camera's performance indoors in situations like museums and restaurants is great. The AWB is not as good as the one on the Nikon S8100 (but the lens mechanism seems to be better than Nikon's, which failed). The zoom and image stabilization are fantastic for both video and stills. I am hoping that Canon gives corrects the problem because as a travel camera, having this much zoom and quality of video in a pocket-size package is great. If they can fix the sound problem, I'll change the review back to the 5 star I first gave it.Here's the rest of original review:I just got the camera yesterday so I haven't gone anywhere. How can I say it's a great travel camera? Last summer I traveled for 30 days in China, carrying a backpack, roller bag, and a ScottEVest. As much as I would love to take an SLR, the weight of the camera and lenses I would need, plus being alone with a prominent camera, make taking an SLR impractical and unwise. I was very happy with the NIkon S8100, but I went through two of them (scratched lens on the first; ""lens error"" on the second. After reading other's experiences trying to get Nikon, I decided to come back to Canon. I looked the Sony travel zooms too and they looked like excellent choices, but I have had good luck with Canon.While I had glanced at the manual online, once the camera arrived, I wanted to start shooting right away. I didn't wait to give the battery a full charge. The controls are fairly intuitive (finding the scene modes takes a bit of practice). The Auto and Easy focus modes work great (I need to read up on the difference; apparently you can easily change settings in the Easy mode, but I have only turned off the flash.). Reviews of the SX230 had complained about the flash automatically popping up and the position. When you are out of the Easy mode, the flash stays down even after you turn it off. In the Easy mode, it pops up after you turn it off if it needs light.The default for the GPS is apparently off when it comes out of the box. When I found I had no GPS data (there's map software that uses Google Maps), I turned it on and took more pictures outside. The SX230 reviews had complained that the camera often wouldn't shoot if it didn't have a GPS fix. I didn't experience that, but I also have an acre and clear shot of the sky. When I checked the track log in the software, I found that at the closest zoom level I had a track that showed all of my wanderings around my yard. iPhoto picked up the location data without any problem. Pictures in Picasa showed the precise location but the default setting hides the location so you don't have to worry about your privacy if you wish to hide it. With the proper setting in Flickr, you get a nice map of the locations in your uploads with precise locations you never even heard of. iy home shows up with the name of the subdivision plot. The only other place I have seen that is on my property deed and the county assessor maps.. I have both a Mac and a PC; there are versions of the software for both. However, I probably won't be using it since I use Lightroom and iPhoto. Both the Mac and the PC had no problem recognizing the camera and transferring the pictures.I tried a few of the scene and effect modes and they seem to work fine. The Supervivid gave a very impressive brightly colored picture of my neighbor's field and horses (see my uploaded images). The ""fisheye"" worked as expected. I shot some ""Very Low Light"" pictures and the camera worked well even though I didn't use a tripod; however, the version that showed up when I tried to upload it to the Amazon gallery didn't show a tree caught in the moonlight. I guess that was because of the compression.The video mode works fine and is accessible with a red record button so you don't have to dial up the video setting which is on the dial. The microphone is very sensitive. I could hear the cars passing on the street 150 yards away (we don't have any buildings between the road and us that dampens the sound). HOWEVER, you can also hear the zoom motor sometimes so if you are going to make video, it would be best to shoot, stop the shot, zoom in or out, and then shoot again. You can see some of the video in my Flickr photostream; I am eslbruce. Of course, when you zoom at the extreme ranges, you do get camera jerking and moving when you are just holding the camera with your hands.I have ordered three extra aftermarket batteries and a charger for my travels. I expect the GPS to drain the battery; hopefully , four batteries will do the trick. In an unusual setting like the Forbidden City or Summer Palace in Beijing, I can easily shoot over 1000 pictures in a day. One review said they got 300 shots from the camera using flash half the time; I am not sure they had the GPS on though.The choices of size of pictures leap from 12mpxl to 6 mpxl for medium. I would prefer 8, but 6 mpxl would still be plenty large enough for a 5x8. The camera comes with no SD card; I ordered four of the AmazonBasic Type 6 SD cards for less than $9 each. It handles the HD video fine with no stuttering or buffer overrun.This review is after less than 24 hours. If something comes up and I decide that the camera has problems and is less than five stars, I will come back and revisit it.","March 29, 2012",
cameras,"Great on average, but Auto mode not great. Beware video squeal!",C. High,R1LEVR8DY3YZM5,3,"NOTE: My previous review stated some strong concerns about a high-pitched audio frequency coming through all the videos. We exchanged the first camera, but the 2nd was not pronounced enough to ding the review significantly for. I have revised the star rating to match, though I'm not convinced it's gone...Let me preface by saying that I've been buying and recommending Canon digitals for over 10 years. In fact I still have my old silver PowerShot S60 stowed away in my drawer, and the SX260 HS is probably our 9th Canon. I'm starting to wonder if that's actually a GOOD sign or not, as the longevity of every new model seems to suffer...After our SX230 began putting out more and more WEIRDLY colored photos in P-Auto mode (in full, healthy sunlight no less where Canons have always shined), we started shopping other brands. There's a lot of good cameras out there but between the Nikon's noise, and the Sony's dull brown colors we always returned what we had and waited for the next in the SX series.Now that we have it, my wife has been really happy with the photo quality in most situations, however the AUTO mode which advertises as being ""so intelligent"" misses the mark on MANY occasions. Especially around kids and low light. Every kids photo comes out blurry, so inevitably I return to P mode and manually up the ISO or force the flash to compensate.The video of the last couple generations has been fantastic in HD, although there is a bit of ambient audio hiss in this model which we don't notice in our older videos.On average though, I can recommend this camera.","April 5, 2012",
cameras,Compared this to the Lumix ZS19 and it came short,Busy at Having Fun,R1G0WWBPH9SOGV,3,"I want to preface that I am not a professional or very dedicated photographer. My review is for people like me: love photography, use mostly scene settings, some manual tinkering (aperture and shutter speed priority) and love to take scenery and wildlife pictures. I am in the market for a smaller camera to take to my hikes/travel etc. to replace my Lumix FZ28 which was stolen on my recent trip to Costa Rica. I already have a Nikon D5100 which I love and takes great pics, but it was just to heavy and bulky to take it along. I purchased both a Canon SX260HS and a Lumix ZS19 to try out because both their specifications seem comparable and I trust both brands. I took pics side by side with these two cameras, and here are my observations:1. color: panasonic colors were generally cooler with more green/blue vs. the canon's warmer colors (yellowish tones) for the same scenes and lighting2. the HDR features of the Lumix are amazing for high contrast/bright background.3. the zoomed pictures for the Lumix were clearer (less blurry) than the Canon's (I took pictures of a power tower and some distant hills in the late afternoon light)4. the most important consideration for me was the ability to focus. I took pictures of flowers and foliage and the Lumix clearly outshone with the feature of the touch screen (I could tell it to focus on a particular petal or detail just by touching the image on the screen) whereas I ended up with a lot of out of focus pictures with the Canon.Note that I did not try the GPS feature of the Canon since it is not that important to me.In conclusion, even the expert reviews talk about a better image quality of the Canon SX260, I decided that for my purposes, I prefer the images that the Lumix ZS19.I am going to return both cameras today and order the Lumix ZS20 instead (because of the promotion, the price of the ZS20 is the same as what I paid for the ZS19, so the GPS feature is for free!!!)","June 2, 2012",
cameras,Takes pics slowly - losing great shots,jjthink,R3CFNNUGBRCXIF,3,"After reading the great reviews and ordering this camera, I am surprised and disappointed at how slowly the camera takes pics. Slower than my ancient Olympus. I don't understand this and wonder if it 'just' a glitch with the particular camera I received or if it is the case with all of them. For example, I was trying to take a pic of my neighbor's kitty standing upright on its back 2 legs and even though he did this for what seemed an extended period of time and I took the photo while he was standing, by the time it 'registered"" he was back on all fours and the standing shot was missed. This happened several times in a row and made me realize how slowly the shots are 'registering'. Does anybody else have the same experience? I would greatly appreciate any insights. Speed of pic taking is something important to me (with wildlife photography and such) and I hadn't read about any problems with this camera.Otherwise, pics seem to be of good quality - haven't had it long enough to properly evaluate anything else just yet.UPDATE!!There may have been a problem with the particular camera I received as I continued to have problems with it and eventually returned it with the help of Amazon. The camera was freezing for greater and greater lengths of time while taking photos (like 2 minutes, finally requiring complete shut down to be able to get the camera running again) and some of the photos came out part black and white (1/3) and part color (2/3), all taken on ""Auto"". I'm sure this can't be normal. I also found the pics to be very fuzzy compared to another person's pics of the same scenes taken with different camera (I would not have realized had I not compared). I'm hoping this was 'just' because the camera was defective. Will give this model another try in the hopes that the particular camera I received was the problem...","August 23, 2012",
cameras,Not the 5 Star Experience I Was Expecting,CFH Review,R39NGOBRT0NP3J,3,I have been looking for a good compact camera with zoom and thought I found the one. What I experienced using the SX260 was the following.The time between taking another picture was too slow. It would take 2 seconds or more between shots to take another picture. The popup flash; not unique to this make or model; made it difficult to hold the camera. It would pop up and then retract and you need to keep your fingers out of the way. The zoom was powerful but using it greatly reduced the quality of the picture. The low light ability of this camera was extremely lacking. With the flash and camera on auto the flash would work sporadically. Many indoor photos were too dark to see. What you see on the LCD display is not what the picture will look like. The LCD screen would look dark and grainy and the picture would come out fine and other times it would look great and the picture would come out looking terrible.I purchase this camera based on the overwhelming number of great reviews and was very disappointed with my experience using this camera. I found it hard to hold. Trying to never have a finger in the way of the flash made it even more difficult. I thought I wanted or needed a super zoom but there is no need if the picture quality is going to be degraded enough to make them useless.Anything is possible and based on the number of 5 star reviews I may have received a lemon. For this reason I gave it a 3 Star rating but it would have been a 1 if it was solely based on my experience in using the SX260.,"December 12, 2012",
cameras,"I'm no camera guru, but I can tell you what I liked and didn't like about this camera",LauraC,R3MER5E16O4D4W,3,"I am your average person. Average in so many ways. When it comes to cameras... the simpler, the better. BUT... I still have SOME requirements. For instance, the size of the lens is important to me. I don't want a small lens. I also don't want to lug around some monstrosity of a camera in order to take pictures of my kids and family. Sorry but being a momtographer just isn't my thing. I still want good pictures though.It was important for me to have a point-and-shoot camera that I could fit in my jeans pockets (and I don't mean skinny jeans. I suppose to a degree I wear ""mom"" jeans, lol). Anyway, this fit the bill for that. I also wanted a camera that took crisp, clear pictures. This also fit the bill for that. I ALSO wanted a camera that was easy to use, since as I said, I am no photographer or momtographer.The ""auto"" feature on this camera was lacking, big time. Although it was wonderful for taking pictures with no flash (particularly pictures of fidgety kids who can't sit still) without having blur.... it sucked for the times I wanted to have a flash for a picture! Too many picture ops. were lost because I had to roll the dial to the ""portrait"" setting, and then change that to ""flash on"" since the auto setting only allows you to have either ""auto"" flash (where IT decides, and sometimes thinks there's enough light when there isn't) or ""off."" I HATED that about this camera and it was very, very frustrating.I also despised that the flash was a pop-up flash. Prior to this camera I had the Canon Sx110. It was a little bulkier but at least I could pop up that lens when I saw fit. This one popped up for you - except often, it was right underneath your finger. So then it would jam because your finger was holding it down (simply because your finger naturally went there in order to grip the camera correctly!)Videos were a good quality, no complaints. Though I didn't like that I wasn't able to snap stills while video was in motion. I can do that with my cell phone but not with this camera? Ugh.It's not a bad camera.... and as I said, the pictures are usually crisp and good. The compactness of the camera and the size of the lens makes me happy. But this is certainly not one of Canon's best. My next camera will be a Panasonic Lumix. Hoping I'll love that one because this one was not one of my favorites.","April 19, 2014",

cameras,Viewing subject on screen in bright day light,Irish Papa,RCLASEI340L0F,3,I found it very difficult to take pictures in bright daylight looking at the screen to try and compose the shot. There has to be some way of providing a way to eliminate the bright day light reflecting on the screen so you can see what you are wanting to take a picture of. Maybe a hood or a flip up top to create a shadow over the screen similar to an umbrella at an outside table. It was impossible to see what I was shooting in bright day light.,"October 2, 2013",
cameras,Great pics form the camera,M. Dembski,R2J9RT5SCNE4VQ,3,"The camera takes great pictures and with the zoom and vibration control you almost never miss a shot. My reservations are in the menu system (too confusing) and the GPS (too confusing and kills the battery). I've had the camera for 2 months and still can't figure out how to take continuous shots (though i;ve done it accidentally, even with the manual it makes no sense). The GPS can be difficult to turn on and off and seems to almost have a mind of its own as to when its going to record the data. I left the camera turned off for 2 weeks and the battery (which had been fully charged) was dead. Makes i8t difficult to keep the camera ready to go. I have a Nikon D3000 and wanted something small that I can carry with me. I've had more inexpensive pocket cameras from Kodak in the past and with both I've had no problems figuring out how to use everything without using the owners manual. With the SX260 I've learned to carry it with me and refer to it when doing anything other than auto. The charges is great in that its very compact., but how bout a way to charge by using a USB cable to your laptop?The camera has lots of potential if Canon tried just a little bit harder.","April 28, 2013",
cameras,Poor battery life,Susan D. Fyfe,R39GJBNAIYL37M,3,"In general I am happy with this camera. I purchased it for a mostly business trip to Germany. I also purchased a spare battery. During the one week I was in Germany I had to recharge each battery once and I didn't take that many pictures. Just recently (about 3 weeks after I got back from Germany) some of my flowers were in bloom so I grabbed the camera and both batteries were dead. Luckily, my Nikon DSLR that I haven't touched in months still had plenty of battery life. So, if you are thinking you can just grab the camera and go, forget it. This is not the camera for you. You will have to plan ahead and make sure you charge a battery the night before you need the camera.","April 11, 2014",
cameras,Not what I was expecting,Original Vidiot,R2LM48XFBAA7V1,3,"I had used an ELPH 300HS for years and was always amazed at how great the pictures were considering how little I know about photography and how much I simply relied on the Auto settings. After I dropped it one day and gave it a concussion, my wife suggested that if I wanted to, I should spend a little more money this time and really get the camera I wanted. She didn't have to tell me twice ! I just assumed that since the ELPH 300 was so good, spending more on another Canon would be even better and the 20X zoom was 4 times that of the previous 300HS, how could I go wrong. Strange as it seems, I just didn't think the pictures were that good, or as good as the older less expensive 300HS. I took pictures of our yard and compared them to the same exact shots from before and I just didn't think they were as good. Ultimately I found the next generation of the original 300HS, the 330HS and bought it. I took the same shots of the yard and sure enough, they were much better than the SX260. Granted, these were taken in the Auto mode but since they all were, it was a decent comparison. The 300 & 330HS also had a slightly wider lens than the SX260. The 330HS while equipped with only half the zoom range of the SX260, still had twice the zoom range of the 300HS so I'm happy with it.","February 19, 2014",
cameras,Gets the basics right but lacks current generation features,RIK,R2VOLHQIUDCUYD,3,"Pros:1. Compared to compact superzooms that I have personally experimented with (Panasonic ZS19, Sony Cybershot DSC WX300, HX20V and HX9V, Samsung WB750, Nikon Coolpix S9100, Casio Exilim EX ZR100) Canon does better at the basics of taking photos and videos than the others.2. The optical image stabilization works well and photos come out nice even with 20x optical zoom fully extended.3. It feels thinner and lighter than most compact superzooms (though Panasonic ZS series models are technically the most compact as the Canon's lens assembly is not flush with the body).4. There is reasonable amount of space to rest your fingers behind the pop-up flash.5. The 'Live' mode is an interesting novelty as it allows you to adjust colors before you take a photo (though the default setting results in the most natural colors).6. My daylight videos turned out just fine even though many reviewers believe Canon to be behind competition in this department.7. Comes with an external charging unit which doesn't require the USB cord and allows the camera to be used with another battery while the first one is being charged.8. The context sensitive menus are easy to navigate.Cons:1. The biggest disappointment was lack of in camera Panorama mode. Canon instead has a stich assist mode which allows you to align multiple snaps and use supplied software to manually put together a panoramic image on your computer. I'd suggest Canon incorporate Casio style in-camera panorama mode, the best implementation of panorama that I have seen so far.2. Flash pops up automatically and you can't push it back down with your finger. I like the design choice of Panasonic, Casio and Samsung compact superzooms where the flash isn't pop up and of Nikon S9100 where it's a manual pop-up and can be pushed back down.3. Even with the pop up flash there were way too many white spots in nighttime photos.4. Lacks the ability to take 3D pictures and email pics using WiFIBottomline is if you are not used to current generation features like panorama mode, 3D pics, WiFi etc. you will like this camera.","December 2, 2012",

I LIKE this SX260 but am not as enthusiastic as my friends. I am a ""recreational"" camera user -- not a serious photographer.My ""issues"" with this camera:-I thought I was going to love the 20x zoom, but I've discovered if you zoom to that capacity you really need to rest the camera on a very firm surface (not just hold it with both hands).-The other thing that bugs me (and was noted by other reviewers but I didn't pay enough attention to) is the placement of the flash. It is right where your fingers hold the camera when taking a picture. It pops up automatically so you really need to make a conscious effort to hold the camera in what, to me, is an unnatural way. The flash always seems to be in the way.-I also miss my viewfinder...why doesn't someone make a mid-priced camera with a viewfinder anymore?-It has a slow shutter speedPositives:- it takes nice pictures with good color- it is very portable- I bought 2 batteries because others had noted their short life, but I haven't found that to be a problem","January 19, 2014",

But it is very heavy and too small to hold steady with such a powerful zoom. But the real drawback is that it does not perform well in low light.

This camera, the third Canon point-and-shoot I've owned, is very good for a shooting a variety of photos except in low-light situations. The pop-up flash is the main glaring fault with this camera. It is located right where your left forefinger rests while taking pictures. In certain shooting modes, if the light isn't adequate, the flash will pop up. BUT, numerous times it has done this when I was attempting to take a photo and my finger stopped the flash from coming all the way up. It jammed and the camera became useless. I had to turn it off, take out the battery, re-install the battery, then turn the camera on again before I could take another picture. I've missed countless shots because of this ridiculous flash problem. Also, it's a large camera and not as easy to carry in a pocket as the previous Canon P&S;'s I've owned. Now, the screen on the back loses power and goes dark after a few seconds. Not Canon's best in my opinion.","March 20, 2013",
cameras,Focusing issues are a killer...,PGo,R3N261YSBKYYU3,3,"I went out and bought this camera, thinking that it would replace a Sony HX20V that I purchased, because I wasn't satisfied with the image quality on the Sony completely. All the professional review sites indicated that the SX260 has the best image quality out of the travel zoom compacts, so I went to a local retailer and purchased it to make sure before I sent back the Sony. Here's what I found:In bright daylight, the SX260 is a great little camera, it focuses well, takes good, sharp pictures and is very snappy overall. The build quality is solid, and overall it compares quite favorably to the Sony. The image quality is slightly better than the Sony's, but overall it's probably is not noticeable for most people. I did notice though, that the Sony has consistently sharper images across the entire scene, whereas the Canon tends to smudge focus towards the edges more.In lowlight though, it's a completely different story. The SX260 continuously hunts for focus in anything less than very bright lighting conditions, which means you're going to miss shots that you would otherwise get with a different camera if your subject is moving. When (or if) it finally does find focus, it often focuses on the wrong subject, especially in complex scenes. The result is that many pictures wind up with very soft focus which very noticeably degrades image quality, even at small print sizes. This is not an issue with other cameras in this class, such as the Sony or the ZS19. In a few cases, the Canon could not lock focus period. I had to go in and manually help it focus or change my position/enable the flash to take some of the shots. Of course, this was using the auto mode on both cameras, so you can probably get it to focus using the manual controls if you take the time to do so, but since most people will probably leave it in auto 90% of the time, it's a good test to compare the two cameras.The real problem though, is that it can take 10-30 seconds for it to hunt for focus, only for it to wind up failing to focus on anything at all! Try getting most people to stay still for that long, and you'll see why that can be a BIG problem with this camera. It's terribly frustrating to have a shot lined up, and then the camera fails to find focus, or worse yet, finds focus in the wrong part of the scene!Overall, the SX260 is a good camera, but the image quality suffers in many situations from focusing issues that it's competitors just don't have. I'm not sure if there's a definitive, ""best"" camera in this class as it seems that each one has its trade-offs, but I wound up keeping the Sony in the long run, even though it has worse image quality overall than the Canon.","December 29, 2012",

cameras,dont buy this camera for its video.,James E. Card,R2HRACCEYR66NX,3,"I bought this camera as a backup for my S100, which has worked very well. The main points I were interested in were a better zoom ( the S100 has only 5X), and the SX's ability to stitch photos into a panorama. The SX is slightly larger and heavier than my S100, but not much. The SX260 has very good zoom, and even at 80X it is clear, though at this magnitude it needs to be put on a tripod for stability. The bad point is the video. There is a constant low level noise, and when I use the zoom during filming, the audio records the clicking of the lens movement also. This is irritating enough for me not to want to use the video, unless I really have to. The bottom line is, if you want a pocketable Canon which is reasonably priced, has good ( noiseless) video, and are not concerned about zoom, I'd go for the S100. I would absolutely NOT buy the SX260 if you want good quality video. If you want a less expensive (I paid $188), camera for still pictures, with great zoom, that fits in your pocket, I'd look at the S260.","June 1, 2014",

When taking video it is even worse, I've had galaxy cellphones take better quality video under low light conditions.The zoom is very good however and there are many settings to get a good shot, keep in mind however that some settings require time for the camera to take a clear shot (slow frame shutter) and can result in out of focus images if you take fast action.","May 18, 2014",
cameras,"Ehh, it's ok.",Michael Petersen,RGFMX73IWTMMD,3,"Not the most user-friendly camera we have owned (and we have owned about 7 or 8 in the past few years), but it does the trick. If you are used to using two hands to hold the camera...which I think most people are, this camera gets a little annoying because if you have your left hand in the upper right corner and you want to use the flash it won't come up. So you have to turn the camera all the way off and then turn it on again to have it re-boot. That gets a little annoying. It's not a bad camera, but for the price I was expecting something a little easier to use.","January 19, 2014",

It's a bit clunky looking, but MUCH smaller than a DSLR and bridges the gap between my T4i and Sony WX-10. Extra-wide angle is a plus.Cons:- As others have reported, the Flash system is BROKEN on this camera. If you hold the camera naturally and the camera thinks it needs a flash, it has a motor that pushes the flash up. If you block the flash as it comes up, you get an error message that requires taking the battery out to clear. Solution? I haven't found one. They should have spring-loaded the flash. I've had this happen a dozen times or so.- Second star comes off for the lack of a Panorama setting. Canon, if you're listening, GIVE US IN-CAMERA PANORAMA PROCESSING! Why? Because EVERYBODY ELSE IS doing it and we want it.","March 26, 2013",

What irritated me to the point of returning it to Amazon after the first day of tests is that in video mode it captures a LOT of noise from the zoom engine to the point that it spoils the video. My old Panasonic Lumix (great little camera but with a less powerful zoom) never did that, it was as silent as any zoom should be.

cameras,Meh. I Miss My PowerShot SD 4000....,C. Sullivan,R3MGCMTGWD7BOA,3,"I am not a photographer -- I'm a picture-taker. I got a bit compulsive about snapping photos when I owned a Canon PowerShot SD 4000 IS (the box says ""Digital Elph"") . Purchased in, like, 2007, I think. Perfect camera for me. I loved the smooth, slim shape, and how the controls were easy to manipulate one-handed. Seriously, I have great photos that I've taken while biking, horseback riding, walking the dog...And the best thing about that old camera was Canon's low-light technology. I have so many fun shots from just whipping out the camera at parties or in bars or even around campfires -- no flash, and they all come out great. The camera is like a cat's eye or something, the way it can use ambient lighting to illuminate indoor/dusky photos that otherwise would come out dark. As a candid image shooter, I rely on the element of surprise/spontaneity. So when I broke my old SD 4000 IS (my bad entirely), I definitely wanted another Canon with the same low-light technology!Canon had introduced a lot of new products since I purchased my old ""digital Elph"" so I had a hard time figuring out which new model to go with. My two main issues: I wanted the low-light tech & I wanted something very small & portable & discreet. I sketched out the measurements for this model on paper before ordering. It actually appeared a little smaller than my old SD 4000....In person though, ugh. It's a stout little thing. Heavy!! Clunky in my hand. Controls aren't nearly as intuitive for me. Hard to find a good case for it, the one I bought along with the camera is a tight, tight squeeze which is nice protection I guess but makes it hard for me to just whip out the camera on a whim.Takes great pics but they're HUGE. I use the ""burst"" function when I take candids so I get like a dozen at once and then pick out the best ones to name & post, right? Well with this camera, I am eating up memory cards, I needed to buy a bigger system backup package, ugh....Other stuff I didn't like: eats up batteries (compared to my old SD 4000, that is). And it's a bit slower than my old camera, when you hold down the button to take a bunch of shots at once, there's considerably more lag. I am not a big fan of all the options, either. Fish eye lens? Really? I'd rather less functions, more functionality.But not a bad camera, at all. Just little too much for this casual picture-taker. I'm not trying to publish calendars, I'm just goofing around, here. Thank goodness for ebay, I've got my little SD 4000 back again so this story has a happy ending!Good luck with your camera search, hope this helped.","February 14, 2014",

cameras,"Great clear zoom, bad close ups",Rhea,RK77EU5ZZUIYC,3,"The zoom is great. I have amazing pictures of birds from 30 yards away that my old camera never could have taken. I'm disappointed with the micro zoom. Trying to take a picture of a tiny flower is impossible. It seems like it should focus on it, but then the autofocus will most often focus on something behind the subject. I'm an amateur photographer, so maybe it can take a good close up if you know how to work all the options, but it's been frustrating for me. But as far as zooming on stuff far away and getting a clear image, this is great! PS, I lost the wall charger, and Canon wanted $50 for a new one.

cameras,Bad for concerts great for still subjects.,"GeekifyChic ""Book junky""",R8JHRREMOAD0,3,I love this camera for taking shots of things that are in the outdoors and even at night. My one major gripe with this camera through is that when the subject is moving the picture turns blurry no matter what setting I have tried. I'm a big music lover so the main reason I got this camera was to shoot video and pictures at the concerts I am seeing and half my photos end up being useless because the body and face are all blurred. Another issue is that when you press record there is a 3 second delay between when you press the button and when it starts which doesn't seem like a big deal in till your trying to catch something as it is happening and the beginning is cut off because of the delay. Long story short if you want a camera for situations where the subject is moving around a lot this wont be the cannon camera for you.,"May 24, 2013",

cameras,Infuriating,Hawkeye,R2FRHREAAB31PR,3,"This is the most infuriating camera I have ever owned. It does take pretty good photos in good light and has a great zoom range, but the controls are terrible. The multifunction wheel is dreadful. Trying to use the rotary function while adjusting one parameter is impossible without accidentally activating one of the several other menus that it also controls. For example, when Manual Focus is selected, rotating the dial will inevitably activate another unwanted menu such as the self timer or compensation function. It is essentially impossible to use the manual focus without changing other settings unintentionally. Or likewise, adjusting the compensation by rotating the dial will ususally result in another menu being opened and that parameter changed unintentionally. In addition, the autofocus is worthless for close-ups and macro work. I have spent many infuriating moments trying to take photos of flowers and the camera is completely unable to focus. And, as noted before, the manual focus is impossible. So basically this is a good camera for portraits and scenery, but forget about macro work and still life photos. Simply infuriating.","January 16, 2013",
cameras,Indoor photos flash or no flash are almost always blurry on auto mode,Kelly,RI8B4BMBQPM1Z,3,"Bought and returned this camera. In auto mode, the camera almost always picks iso800 and produces blurry pictures. Without flash pictures are still blurry. I bought the Sony hx30v because its indoor pictures were by FAR sharper and more pleasing, flash or no flash. When I returned the canon at target, the SA commented that others had returned the camera due to blurry pictures. I'm still shocked by the glowing reviews and I am hoping I save someone from similar disappointment and possible restocking fees having to return the canon sx260. I expect to get bashed for this review.

cameras,Really wanted to love this camera,J. Spence,R3VZYPA2X3HVFK,3,"I broke my Nikon D60 DSLR and then I broke my Sony Cyber-shot DSC-WX50 16.2 MP Digital Camera with 5x Optical Zoom and 2.7-inch LCD (Black) (2012 Model) and so I set out to find the best of both worlds in one camera. After reading all the raving reviews, viewing countless sample photos, and researching the competing cameras, I went to Best Buy and purchased the SX260.I'm disappointed but I want to love this camera really bad because it has everything I was looking for, or so I thought: great optical zoom, great image quality and stunning colors, black and white shooting mode, compact point-and-shoot style.So why am I disappointed? Because of the image quality. Seriously I'm feeling a bit alone in my opinion after reading through the other reviews to see if I'm loosing my mind but to me the image quality is well below standard. Low light, bright light, optimal light, any setting, flash or no-flash, the images seem to be blurry. Not blurry like going without your glasses blurry but not sharp, crisp. For example a shot with my Sony with 5X zoom was so clear I could zoom in and crop and still keep amazing detail. When I took it to New York City I took some amazing shots at night from the Empire State Building without a tripod, just resting it on the concrete wall. With the Canon, night time shots of the city are near impossible and forget zooming in on any shot regardless of the lighting. Once you zoom in you'll see distortion, smoothing, dull images.In summary, this Canon is well built, easy to use and user friendly. Loaded with features and shooting modes. The 80X digital zoom is very impressive and the built in image stabilization works surprisingly well. The image quality is left to the eye of the beholder and to me it significantly lacks, especially for the price of this camera. Video quality is decent to great depending on lighting but expect to get a lot of inner mechanical noise feedback. I think I am going to sacrifice the optical zoom and find another camera.","December 4, 2012",

The picture quality is fabulous, but BOTH of them have an obvious and annoying squeal to the video. Even though I'm getting it primarily as a camera and don't currently take a ton of video, I would certainly like the product that I am purchasing to function as it should.

I knew better, it almost got me several times, but this once, and once is enough, I didn't take the time to put the strap on my wrist to snap a picture in Bergen Norway in broad day, the flash popped up, next thing I knew it was out of my hand. I tried to catch it, but it tumbled on the cobble stones. Nicked here and there but here's the damage, a third of the viewer now is useless. believe it or not, as far as I know, that is only damage, enough to make me sick, and my purchase price more or less down the drain.

cameras,"Barrel distortion: Goofy funhouse mirror effect in the corners, ASA issues","Oliver ""Oliver""",RGRXP20QT0OIE,3,"I upgraded to this camera from my nine years-old Canon S1IS, so of course I was blown away in many ways by this camera, including by the size and ease of using the LCD, the speed, the size of the camera, the power and stabilization of the zoom and generally speaking the sharpness and richness of color of the photos I can get out of it. I very nearly returned it, though, and have resigned myself to it with mixed feelings. Because there are so many options to tweedle with that I'm not sure I've mastered them, I won't lay down an absolute verdict on everything that dissatisfies me about the camera, but I have to let out a yowl over the funhouse mirror effect in the corners of the wide-angle images. People's hair-dos and heads splurge into the corners like lava lamp blobs, and I find myself having to throw away some of my favorite compositions (unless you like the cliche tourist snapshot with your subjects centered against that sunset or mountain range, you want to frame them toward the side, in which case, you can take the shot but won't want to show it to anybody who knows the person in the upper left or right hand corner). The auto-white balance is very untrustworthy indoors, the default the colors are surreally intense and over warm (as has become the standard it seems) and to my surprise the artificial intelligence can't tell you're under trees on an overcast day, so I have to stop down in order not to overexpose my photos. Even though there are many options, there is no mode that gives you all of them, so you don't get to take advantage of everything you might like. I find I can't easily stay away from the high ASA settings, over which the sharpness drops steeply. Partly it's just a slow lens even at wide angle, but also it seems pumping up the ASA to 1200 or higher is the camera's favorite way to get the exposure right. I also miss the spot-focus/spot-metering button of my old Canon (you have to enter the everything menu to do anything), and wish it either told me or had a stop mid-zoom for the equivalent of a standard lens (i.e. neither fish-eye nor telephoto). What else? It's not nearly so small and light as the less zoomy point-and-shoots--I was particularly surprised by how heavy it is--and it's just absurd how you're forced to hold the camera to avoid blocking the popup flash (fortunately for me, I don't use flash much, and just set it to off). Still, the thing is a marvel. As every reviewer says, you get a lot for the compromise it represents.","February 24, 2013",
cameras,Photos are just not crisp - sent it back,S. Mackey,R2SI3YM3FGW32S,3,"I was so excited to receive this Canon SX260 after reading rave reviews from owners and digital camera websites. I wanted a camera to slip into my pocket (sort of) that would take good quick photos, and this seemed to fit that description. The camera is blazing fast to start, focus, shoot, flash, reshoot, wireless transfer, and just feels well balanced and sturdy.Too bad the pics are soft and fuzzy. I took over 400 photos in the first couple of days: inside, outside, macro, telephoto, portraits, candids, and some on a tripod to verify what my eyes were telling me.Regardless of lighting conditions, this camera just does not take crisp photos. On a tripod to reduce the possibility of movement, the photos are beautifully color balanced, just nothing is sharp in the photos. I let other people look at the photos on my computer and on my HDTV. The same comments over and over, ""I can't figure out where the camera is focused. There isn't any place that is sharp.""I'll continue to use my old Sony DSC-H5. Slower (a lot!), with lower resolution (7.2MP), but the photos it takes are much sharper and stand-up to zooming and cropping for prints. I took some test photos side-by-side with the H5 and this SX260. Hands down, the H5 takes better pics, even if it is slower to use.Maybe it is the new sensors?","December 27, 2012",

You can take manual control (in which you set aperture and shutter speed independently--and I do that on an unfortunately regular basis because of the lack of an exposure control), but it would be really, really nice to have.Mine broke today after about a year of owning it, and it looks like this is still by-far the best rated travel zoom camera out there.

If I am not using it as a compact camera anyway, something a bit larger and more ergonomic would have been better. Plus - and this is my fault - I should have gone by Target or somewhere and felt the camera - a mistake I won't make again. I bought this because it was rated highly on Amazon and by a consumer magazine, but overall think I should have spent the extra $100 and moved up. I would suggest putting any camera in your hands before you buy it - lesson learned.If you want a camera with a nice zoom to take outdoor pics of your kids, this is a good one, but for birthday parties and other indoor uses, based on my personal experience here my suggestion is look elsewhere, as the speed and quality of the flash photos left us disappointed. We are keeping this, though, because for $200 it is still a good deal based on the zoom/outdoor capabilities - just not the all-around camera we were looking for.","March 26, 2013",
cameras,"very nice pictures, yet still a deal breaker for me",vlklng6,R1HMDVNCAXT19V,3,"I bought this camera due to the good reviews, and the camera does live up to its reviews. Nice quality pictures for an amateur like me. Easy to set up, I took pictures mostly of my dog and my backyard, and they came up really good, both in good light and low light. So why did I only give it 3 out of 5 starts? I just can't stand the flash poping out on me whenever it decides to, because that's where my finger is as I'm holding the camera. More often than not it startles me and I almost dropped the camera once or twice. It became so annoying that it had to go back. This is a problem with a lot of cameras which are otherwise very good, and I am very disapointed by the flash location. My old Panasonic has the built in flash that always shows and doesn't pop up on its own. I wish I could keep it as I otherwise really liked it.","March 22, 2013",
cameras,OK but Battery Life Terrible. Lacking Features,John,R2PNHW30A60WIZ,3,"I tried this camera, the Sony HX10 and the Panasonic ZS20, and ended up returning this camera. All three take excellent pictures. The Canon may look the best at the pixel peeping level but at a normal printing level, there is very little difference. The flash is in a very awkward location on both the SX260 and the Sony. Panasonic has the best flash location. The SX260 had by far the worst battery life among the 3 cameras. It also has arguably the worst movie mode and fewer features such as sweep panorama, 3D, etc. Of the 3, I was most impressed overall by the Sony.","March 3, 2013",

My husband and I have had many digital cameras since they have been out in the market and Canon has made some good ones, and some not so good. What I didn't like about the camera is how the overall sharpness and crispness of the picture was not there. In certain lighting, details get washed out. Colors are not bad, but what good is true color if the details are not there? Yes, in some pictures it was perfect, but you have to mess around with various controls to get the ideal picture. The choices of modes were redundant: easy mode? really? When there is auto and live mode? That takes away the credibility of Canon because between you and me, that seems flat out dumb!The pop up flash is in a very bad position because it may startle you at any time and you could lose your grip on the camera.With 12 MP, the overall size of the pictures were not very big and zooming in on them once in the computer, you see many artifacts.I am returning this camera and getting the Olympus SZ-15 which has an even better Megapixel count (16) and longer zoom (24).I have had Olympus cameras before and their build as well as their picture quality have been excellent.

cameras,The best landscape or studio DSLR available today,"Emmanuel ""ShutterMan""",R2ZLAFD12435MV,3,"_*********************************************************** Update 04/15/2013: This update is for event shooters/photojournalists.** Enthusiasts, hobbyists, still life and landscape professionals can skip down to my original review below and call it a 5-star camera.**********************************************************After a year of ownership with three bodies, these are my final thoughts. This is the best landscape or studio DSLR in the market. Other than not having a mode dial with Custom User Settings (U1, U2) like the D7000, this camera has near perfect ergonomics.However, I do not recommend the D800 for paid work that have once in a lifetime moments, such as capturing the first kiss at a wedding or truly spontaneous moments, because there is a high probability of missing focus. When situations have no do-overs, equipment inadequacies are not an option. This is the reason why I stopped searching for a ""good copy"" of the optically superior Sigma 35mm 1.4 and settled for the more reliable Canon.I have had both bodies and a replacement body (serial 3041XXX) ""fixed"" by Nikon and they felt the last fixes were good enough. Good enough, I did not invest $18,000 into a system for good enough! Without getting into the whole left side autofocus (AF) saga, which is readily available on other reviews and websites, the AF is horribly inconsistent even with the latest firmware (A: 1.01/B:1.02) using the center AF sensor.My percentage of focused photos took a massive dive with this camera; I tried compensating by closing down the aperture a few stops, but the increase in depth-of-field area was not always enough. With the D3/D700, I would wait for moments and capture it with one shot. The D800 missed focus often enough that I began shooting in spray n' pray style, however, often the focused photo was not what I wanted. Creating the dilemma, do I give the client a great moment that is out of focus by meters or a ho-hum moment in focus? When I owned the D3 and D700, I used to shoot 500-1000 photos per event, I was taking 3,000-5,000 photos with the D800. This MASSIVE increase of photos created a workflow nightmare and my quality of work suffered (subjects centered, ISO's in the 12,800-25,600 range to allow for smaller apertures).Autofocus problems only get worse when in AF-C, if shooting a person walking towards the camera at a slow to medium pace in the F/1.4-2.0 range, expect 1 out of 10 perfectly focused, 1-2 acceptable, and the rest throwaways. Stop down to F/5.6 and at best it's 50/50. I took a huge financial hit switching to Canon (selling used, buying new), however, my two Canon 5D MkIII's get 7 perfectly focused, 2 acceptable, and about 1 throwaway running the same test of a person walking towards the camera. Stop down one or two stops for near perfect results.Nikon does many things better than Canon. In body AF Assist Light, intervalometer, spot metering based on AF point, intelligent Auto ISO, better AF position selector, better access to flash options, and many more. Overall, less menu digging, and obviously Nikon's megapixel advantage is nice for cropping.The ten plus (I actually lost count) trips to Nikon service centers can attest just how much I wanted this camera to work. Nikon customer service is beyond atrocious and their technicians are incompetent. Maybe a few years into production, new D800s will be adequate, but I will never know because I do not see myself buying Nikon again.The Canon 5D MkIII's sensor has less dynamic range, 1.3 bits less color space, but those 24 bits it does have are beautiful colors that require less post-processing for nice skin tones. Because I am confident that the AF will not miss, I am now shooting 300-600 photos per event, that plus less time in post. My turnaround went from 4-6 weeks (culling missed focus photos and fixing color) to only 2-7 days with the inferior Canon. My clients are happier because they are getting their photos fast. In the end, I prefer focused images taken by an average sensor, than a blurred images taken with a sensor with all the dynamic range and megapixels in the world.BOTTOM LINE:The D800 is perfect for photographers that shoot landscapes with Zeiss lenses, people that like having subjects perfectly centered, or autofocus then recompose photos in the F/5.6-11 range. However, if you shoot wide open with fast primes and not getting the ""shot"" puts yourself or company at risk, look into another camera. If my livelihood did not depend on camera equipment, I would have stayed with Nikon. However, in my line of work there are no do-overs, thus the Nikon advantages gave way to its faults, and after struggling with Nikon's abysmal QC and CS in recent years (SB-900, D7000, D300s, three D800's, 28mm AFS 1.8, 35mm AFS 1.4) and reading about D600 issues. I will not be buying a Nikon for work anytime soon.********************************************** Original Review*********************************************Below are my observations after one month of ownership.Pros:-----+ Resolution: Amazing detail when shot with the right glass and settings.+ Dynamic Range: Incredible, when shooting in lower ISO's it is near impossible to ruin a photo. Search the internet for ""fred miranda d800 review Yosemite"" to see real life comparisons.+ Color: I recommend creating custom profiles using a X-Rite ColorChecker Passport Software or Adobe DNG profiler for better than Adobe LR colors.+ AutoWB: Works well in about 70% of lighting scenarios, somewhat better than the D3/D700. *** See Tip Below ***+ Low ISO: Having a true 100 ISO is godsend for on-location lighting setups or shooting wide open in daylight.+ High ISO: The D800 and LR4 do an excellent job in controlling noise. Using PS plug-ins a properly exposed image can print acceptable 8x10's at ISO 12800 (max for D3/D700's is 6400).+ Tonality: With a good camera profile in LR4, the tonal range rivals Fujifilm 400H Film. This is incredibly useful on portraits with 4-1 or greater lighting ratios. Posterization in the shadows (DSLRs Achilles' heel) is only noticeable on highly manipulated images.+ Handling: The Auto ISO is easier to engage and the new position of the ISO button is more intuitive.+ Exposure: Better than D3/D700, but far from perfect. Contrary to Nikon's literature, it struggles with backlit scenes.+ Battery Performance: It can get me through a full day's shoot if I avoid extensive LiveView or WiFi use, otherwise I need to use a backup battery.Cons:------ Software: Nikon software can produce excellent results, but it is clunky and slow.- Handling: Awkward placement of the mode selector button (to make room for movie record), lacking the D7000 U1/U2 style custom banks, switching of AF modes is not as effortless as the D700.- Autofocus: All 51 points are still too centrally located, no increase in cross-type sensors over the D3/D700, all the cross-type AF sensors are in the middle, like the D3/700, the outer sensors are near useless in low lit, low contrast situations. * For more details on AF performance, see update above and commentsSummary:Using proper technique, the images this camera produces are superior to any camera I ever shot. Would I jump systems for this camera? If I owned a large collection of top-tier gear, NO! Otherwise, I would consider it if I was not too invested. Does it equal or better Medium Format? There are differences in perspective, defraction limits, DOF, FOV, and CANNOT BE COMPARED. Having shot Canon (AE-1, 630, A2, Elan II, 20D, 40D, 5D mkI & mkII, 1D's), Nikon (FM, F4, F100, D200, D300s, D7000, D700, D800, D3), Fuji (S3, S5), Mamiya (645, RB67), and Hasselblad (H4D-40), I know that they are excellent tools that are capable of creating amazing images. Pick the one that best fits your needs and have fun shooting.*** TIP *** To improve WB (green cast), use the WB Fine-Tune (pg. 149) and shift Magenta 1 or 2 points or use a X-Rite Passport for every scene change.","April 26, 2012",
cameras,Great camera with a problem,"W. Kurtz ""B. Kilgore""",R360ALOPHWI0FS,3,"It makes me very sad to write this review as I am a confirmed Nikon user. I had waited several months, like most people for my D800. I have read a lot of reviews that have praised the camera for its outstanding images and resolution and many that express frustration over the ""green tint"" and the ""left focus"" issue. I have not experienced the green tint but my camera does suffer from very pronounced issues with the left focus point. I will try to cover some new ground in this review that has not been covered in other reviews that I have read, mainly that when I say the left focus point, what I really mean, and I don't think that others have articulated this, is that it is the column of all three left focus points that are affected. At least that is true in my case. The center is razor sharp. I tested with a 24-70 at 2.8 and flash to remove camera shake issues. Nikon has asked me to submit samples and they were very nice about it. I am torn as to whether to submit the camera for repair or to return it.On the positive side the camera does pretty much everything else superbly. Great handling. Beautiful color. Responsive. It really does put medium format performance in a dslr form factor. Truly incredible.I know a lot of people have trashed the D800 with 1 star over this issue and I personally disagree with that. I think 3 stars is fair because this is not such a minor issue that a one star deduction would be appropriate, nor should it overshadow all the amazing things this camera does. I will own one at some point. It's just a matter of whether it is this one or one that is produced after a fix is in place. That all being said, the D800 is a complex piece of technology and the reality is that just about everything that relies on technology today requires adjustments. This includes everything from computer software to a Mercedes. I hope this review comes across as fair and balanced as I want it to be.====Update====Nikon looked at my images on Wednesday after I submitted them on Saturday which I think is pretty darn good turn around for a big company. The rep that I spoke with readily acknowledged the issue and immediately sent me an email with instructions on how to send the camera in for repair. I can't really ask for more than that. Yes, I would have liked for it to be perfect out of the box but Nikon is being very responsive and courteous. My only word of advice is to call them early or at off hours. In the afternoon the hold times can be long. I will update this review as things unfold.=======Update 7/24/2012=========I now have the D800 back from Nikon. I tested it today and while there is about a 65% improvement in the left focus point performance it does not match the focus of the center points. This is apparent to non-technical viewers who were asked to look at images on screen without being told which was the ""good"" one in advance. Each time the viewer picked the left focus point images as less well focused. They also felt that a left focus point image from the original batch prior to Nikon servicing the camera was less well focused than the new, post repair, left focus point images. On some images quite honestly I felt like I was pixel peeping and that the difference between the center and the left was quite small, while on others it was glaring. My concern is that for some portraits that it would be an annoyance. Just out of curiosity I mounted the same 24-70 on my old D200 and shot the same series of test images. What I found is that even on the D200 there is a perceptible difference in focus quality between the left and center. Again this was confirmed by a ""blinded"" subject. I have always been thrilled with the pictures from my D200. I have carried it on five continents and taken some of the best pictures of my life with it. I never noticed the ""left focus issue"". I think that there is a difference with the D800. Part of the appeal is the amount of detail in the image and the slightest imperfections in focus are more apparent than with a camera like the D200. Considering all of this and the fact that I really can't afford to upgrade my DSLR's less than every 7 or so years, I have decided to return the camera tomorrow and try another copy in the near future. As I said at the beginning of my review I am a dyed in the wool Nikon fan and my experience with the D800 has not been a great one. My D4 on the other hand is fantastic. I will be posting that review soon.========Update 7/25/2012========Returned original D800 today. Happened to check online to see if by some miracle a local Best Buy in the city had one. The one closest to me did not but one on the East Side did. I went and purchased it and brought it home for testing. Sadly it has the same problem. I ran basically the same set of tests on the camera and it had the same left focus issue. I not only showed the problem at f2.8, it exhibited the problem all the way to f5.6. This is why I have lowered my rating to two stars. If the camera worked as it should it would be wonderful, however in my limited experience it doesn't. I think I have given it every chance but to no avail. I am happy that there are people out there that have cameras without the issue. Just out of curiosity if you read this and don't have the left focus issue and feel like leaving a quick comment I would like to hear about your experience.I am not sure where I go from here. I really want a full frame Nikon that is lighter than my D4. I guess we'll see what happens at Photokina.============Update 8/9/2012==============The D800 is much more widely available now and so I tried a third body. It was initially out of focus in both the center and left focus points with my 24-70 wide open. This actually gave me hope that I would be able to correct the problem with the focus fine tune adjustment setting. I spent about two hours of trial and error attempting to find a set up that would bring the focus into razor sharpness. I even shot some test with my D4 and compared them side by side just to be sure that I wasn't looking for too much out of the lens. I finally had to give up. It just wouldn't work. No harm done because of good return policies. Just wish that I could luck into one of the D800's that don't have this issue.=========Update 2/2/13============Well I finally got a good D800. I checked the left focus on this unit with a 306 series serial number and it seems fine with focus. I am so happy. I again had a neutral party try and pick the photo that looked different and he could not identify any differences this time. I did have to apply a very mild focus fine tune to the 24-70 2.8 to achieve optimal results at both the center and the left but that is to be expected. +2 adjustment. I am going to add one star at this point to reflect that I now have a working camera. It was also nice to get the unit at 2799 instead of the previous price. If anything changes or is worth noting I will update this review again.","July 7, 2012",
cameras,batch #303xxxx still has the left AF point issue,"Alexey ""Alexey""",R232I9L7P29RD,3,"Batch #303xxxx still has the left AF point issue. No green tint though, at least to my eyes. Good that I've bought this warranty that came with it, this should cover shipping to Nikon for calibration.Update: turned out that Squaretrade warranty doesn't cover items that were defective from the start, so that goes back to Amazon.Update: I've got a replacement from Amazon (very fast by the way) and the camera still has the same left focus point issues. Serial # is 3036xxx, so its basically the same batch as the one I've tried before. Though I've only tried 2 bodies, I have a feeling that all of these D800s are the same, including the D800Es. The reason why not everyone notices it is because its not that bad in real-life and you can see it clearly only under controlled conditions and with a fast lens wide opened.That being said, I'm keeping the camera. It's great otherwise, and I'm hoping to get it fixed some time in future when I send it out for sensor cleaning. I still got that Squaretrade warranty thing that should cover it. Nevertheless, the 3-star rating stays, because Nikon needs to pay more attention to their quality control, and that's the only way I can help it happen.Update: I have noticed oil particles on my sensor and had the camera shipped to Nikon for cleaning and calibration. Good thing I bought that additional Squaretrade warranty, because Nikon's warranty doesn't cover sensor cleaning. Anyway, my camera was calibrated, and now all autofocus points work perfectly.","August 2, 2012",
cameras,Left Focus Issue - Two Times,Spartan27,R22U9HVFH8CT3Q,3,"Ordered one in mid July. It had the left focus problem. Sent it back for refund. Ordered another one in late July. Same thing--left focus issue. Also sent back for refund. Amazon customer service is excellent about this, but it's still frustrating and time consuming. It's a shame they can't test for this before they ship them out.Still want a D800--but at full price, just want a defect-free one out of the box. Will try again in a month or so. Apart from the focus issue, it's a remarkable camera. If its durable, it will be well worth the money.","August 20, 2012",
cameras,Stars Off For Quality Issues and Poor Support,"Preston S. Page ""Preston Page""",R2NF2FBJO3WLE5,3,"The Nikon D800 is for me an upgrade to the D700 and has been a mixed blessing. In general, I like the camera, but it turns out to be very high maintenance.Pros- First, the resolution and dynamic range are superb. No DSLR does better.- 100% viewfinder coverage is a big advance over the D700- USB 3.0 transfer speed is very welcome for shooting tethered- Improved controls layout- HD video capability is great- Dual card slots- The high ISO is slightly better than the D700/D3 in spite of the 3x resolution jumpCons- Build quality; I have both the ""soft left Auto Focus"" and the ""inconsistent center Auto Focus"" issues.- Poor Nikon Support; Nikon tech support closed both of my support requests as solved without a resolution or even any sort of comment! This is the worst support experience I've ever had for any product.- Battery life is really bad. A heavy shooting day will easily burn through three batteries.- Poor third party support. For instance, as of this writing, Adobe does not support tethering to Lightroom 4, Camera RAW for D800 NEF isn't very good and there are no lens correction profiles available. Eye-Fi cards don't quite work properly.- Many CF cards that worked fine with the D700 are not compatible with the D800.- Two handed feel isn't as good as the D700. The thumb ridge on the grip has a lower profile, making the camera a little less secure in the left hand. Grip space for the right hand is almost non-existent.I've been a Nikon shooter for 40 years. Unless the support somehow improves drastically in a few weeks, this will be the last Nikon product I buy.","September 4, 2012",

cameras,I think I will eventually be happy I bought a pair of D800s,Philip Long,R23WXDAM8ZE58U,3,"In mid to late 2011 I decided that I would move to FX primarily (and m4/3 for lightweight/portable). I had been using a pair of D7000 bodies semi professionally, but good as they were there were problems that just got in the way. The primary one is the depth of field control the larger sensor allows. A close second is lens availability. There is no 16-50mm f/2.8. The 70-200mm f/2.8 is too long at the short end on DX for event work. There are no PC-E lenses. The options for 16mm are very limited and awkward, even with 3rd party lenses. All of which is unfortunate because the D7000 handles pretty nicely especially with the grip. I had used a D3 and D700 as stop gaps while I tried to settle on a D4 or D800 (or D700 or D3s or D3). I wanted good video as a possible option; I wanted the new generation AF system and controls etc. etc. Just all the little things that would be better about the new generation compared to the old, so I pre-ordered both a pair of D4s and D800s, the D800s from Amazon on Feb 7. While waiting for them, I canceled the D4 ... basically, the frame rate wasn't something I needed and the flexibility of using the D800 without grip + the extra pixels won out. Especially at a $6k discount!It's been a decidedly mixed bag since. On one hand, the handling, image quality, and low ISO performance, cropping flexibility are everything that I hoped for and more, there has been a lot of friction as well.I had a trip to Yosemite scheduled with me departing May 13. Though Amazon estimated delivery by April 30, and mid April I contacted Amazon to confirm the estimate, the bodies didn't show up until May 14. Splitting CF/SD slots is annoying. One or the other, eh? $450 for the battery grip is grating, even if you have become accustomed to Nikon's gouging on accessories.And now, the cherry on top, the dreaded left focus issue. On both bodies. I had been driving myself nuts trying to figure out why some of my pictures were OOF. I have pretty good technique and usually get good hits. My subjects move sometimes so I thought that might be it. Something was bothering me and I couldn't figure out what. Then I ran the test and >.< two defective bodies. I had hoped to exchange via cross shipping the defective D800s Amazon delivered to me. No luck with that, the window apparently closed June 14 so July 17 is right out. They did inform me that I could contact Nikon.So I did. I'll just say that the tech rep I spoke with there wasn't too impressed with my plight. Suggested that I upload some test shots to ""my nikon"" and in 2 or 3 days someone would get back to me, and we would go from there. If it needed repairs maybe in 2-3 weeks I'd get my bodies back. Renting 2 D800 replacements for 3 weeks while Nikon fixes the defective units they produced would be north of $1000. Not impressed with the help I'm getting here, especially from Nikon who messed up big time.So I have a product with lots of spectacular qualities. And lots of downsides. And not a lot of help from the manufacturer when I run into trouble. If felt better about other aspects of Nikon beyond the engineering the D800 is a 5 star product, hands down. As it is, if you buy one you have to buy the Nikon organization too, at least after 30 days.*** Edit *** There have been some posts questioning the left sensor focus problem. I have posted to flickr the test I conducted on a tripod with a cable release and lit by flash; you will notice that all of the live view and the right phase detect sensor produce acceptable focus; the center phase detect is marginal and the left phase detect sensor is awful. This was try for both D800s I purchased from Amazon. As of 7/23/2012 I am still waiting to hear back from Nikon. A downgrade from 3 stars to 2 seems more likely.*** Update 8/1/2012 **** Changing review from 3 stars to 2 stars. Nikon didn't even look at the photos I sent them before yesterday. Then all they did was email me back stating the photos had been ""edited in some way"". They hadn't, but apparently Nikon considers NEF->Lightroom->JPEG editing. So I tried to upload the NEFs. But their web application won't accept the NEFs their own camera generates!!!! I uploaded the nefs to my own website and sent them a link. I asked them to acknolwedge. They didn't. I called and the support said they were ""after hours"" and couldn't help me because HQ had the case. HQ still hasn't responded. It's ridiculous; The images show what Nikon has seen many many times before now. Left phase detect sensors that are badly calibrated. They are making me jump through hoops for what purpose rather than telling me when they will fix their defective product. Beware buying Nikon the company along with the body. It's really too bad that they managed to royally mess up such an otherwise excellent product with their ""support"" culture.*** Update 8/17/2012 *** I received the first one back from NikonUSA and with some quick testing the focus seems to be spot on. MUCH better across the sensors than previously. Also, NikonUSA is being responsive to my concerns. Back to 3 stars.","July 20, 2012",
cameras,Nikon wants a lower rating.,SanPa,RFVB7L95SXJKE,3,"UPDATE to my updateMore spots = more service. This time, I found the typical round spots as well as a newly identified faint blob on images. These artifacts were best reproduced against a sky blue background. I do like the image quality, but I am absolutely livid about the continuing spot issue. Also on the last occasion, the fine tune settings shifted requiring optimization recalibration of all my lenses.UPDATEMy original review was conferred with 5 stars. I dropped the score to 4 stars after 2x service stops for oil spots. Today, I dropped the score another point for a general system AF shift post service. In short, I am having to apply extreme AF settings to get sharp focus results with my lenses. For example, my 17-35mm worked perfectly with zero adjustment before the second servicing for oil spot removal, and my camera now requires a full 17+ post service. I have to wonder if Nikon has lost its commitment to quality control; the chairman's message is about transparency, but I suppose the consumer doesn't count.ORIGINALI had been looking forward to the day when I'd be able to step up from DX to FX, and be able to capture images approaching film quality. The D800 is that camera for color image capture.I have had over 2500 actuations since my purchase in early December. There have been no issues noted with left side AF when tested at 17 and 35mm at f/2.8 (camera serial 301xxxx). I did note a penchant for green hues, but that was easily remedied via color balance (setting M1). As for performance against the D300 ... well, I hope my daughter enjoys it as much as I did.The colors are really magnificent with a depth approaching Ektachrome, Image details are razor sharp even when blown up; it is amazing to see the facial details, the individual hairs, on a big cat taken 25 yards distant with the D800 and a 70-200mm lens. Being able to duplex captured images has been very handy ... I've already had one instance where an image was deleted on one card, but still available from the second card (I'll admit wishing there were 2 CF slots vs. one SD and one CF).Alas, Nikon hasn't quite achieved perfection.- A sensor oil droplet. Drat that it should have happened, and for the extra work to remove them from my photos. While traveling through LA, I deposited the camera at Nikon's west coast service center in the morning, and retrieved the camera the afternoon of the same day [I have to wonder what else Nikon fixed under the radar, so to speak].- Some controls have changed relative to the D300 which makes for a bit of re-education.- And as noted earlier, there was the green hue. I compensated for it using Rockwell's published hint of adjusting the color balance.- There is an annoying rattle when the flash is closed, which is most of the time, and which stops when the flash is deployed. I guess that's normal, when the locking springs are not engaged.Overall, I'm very impressed. But, I add the final note that the new camera has also been a bit of a home wrecker. My D300 was, as noted, relegated to a new home, my F100 has been demoted to B&W;, and the venerable FE is to be retired to eBay.ADDENDUM - Two sensor spots in exactly the same coordinate as previously reported. Knocking down 5 star rating to 4, as this should not have recurred had Nikon tech service performed the service correctly.","January 26, 2013",

cameras,"A good studio or landscape camera, yet it pushed me to Canon",M. McCasland,R3P2YVOOZYIZQD,3,"This camera pushed me, a long-time Nikon user, to Canon.This camera would probably be wonderful in a studio environment on a tripod or doing landscapes. Also, I thought the video quality was very good, arguably better than the Canons' straight-out of the camera even considering some of the limitations pointed out in reviews aimed to more professional videographers. (See Phillip Bloom's excellent review of the MkIII and D800 video comparision.) However, for everything else, I didn't see the point in using the D800. It is much more of a speciality camera in my book than an all-around tool. For the speciality tasks it undertakes (on a tripod), the results are wonderful. Yet its performance the rest of the time, I believe, will be eye-opening to the average buyer expecting to use it as an all-around camera like the D700.More details:With the D800, I couldn't get anything usable handheld without crazy-high shutter speeds. Unfortunately, high shutter speeds routinely caused the ISO to be bumped. Then, I noticed noise before zooming in at all, much less pixel-peeping. Having owned a D700 for years, I found myself reverting back to the D700 as an all-around camera and only shooting the D800 when a tripod was possible. However when a tripod was used, the image quality improvement over the D700 was apparent to virtually any non-technical user (read: clients, family) -- and isn't that ultimately all that matters? That clearly better image quality over the D700 when a tripod was possible got me lusting for something more all-around that had higher IQ than the D700.Curiosity got the best of me and I bought a Canon MkIII and a few assorted lenses, fully expecting to return or resell the camera unless the quality was immediately apparent. I found myself shooting the MkIII alongside the D700 and D800. In many situations where a tripod wasn't possible or practical, most of the D800 images simply got deleted upon review in Lightroom due to blurring. In the situations where the D800 and MkIII were both used on a tripod, the D800 images were better than the D700, but simply on par with the MkIII unless one really started pixel-peeping (then the D800 looked far cleaner), but again I could care less about pixel peeping since clients too could care less.That left me primarily going-to and comparing the D700 and MkIII for nearly all non-tripod shooting I do. (After collecting dust for a while, I sold the D800, at a profit.) While I could take a Nikon image and run it through Lightroom and Photoshop to get the looks I wanted, I was pleased/surprised to find the Canon starting points on images to be closer to the final look I was after. (Note: I am not saying Canon images are better or more right, I am just saying the basic imported Canon files take *me* much less work than the Nikon files to achieve *my own personal look*.) After doing a few shoots and realizing how much less Lightroom and Photoshop work I had to do with the Canon images, I slowly got to using the MkIII nearly exclusively and just carried the 2 D700s and lenses with me as backups.It's now been about a month using nothing but Canon and I am seriously thinking of just selling my Nikon gear altogether. For *my personal style*, I find that I get many more ""keeper"" images with the MkIII than I ever did with my Nikons (D40s, D300s, D700s, D7000s, D800s) -- i.e. I am routinely amazed by getting very sharp images at 1/50th of a second handheld -- something I couldn't do with any of my $2000+ Nikon VR lenses. Then, the time savings in post for my style really pushed me more and more to Canon. Others' goals may be much different and the looks they are after are better suited for Nikon. For example, I could see journalistic or sports photographers preferring a Nikon over Canon. I would too in their shoes. However, *for me* the Canon very surprisingly fit me much better. (After investing so much in Nikon, eagerly awaiting the D800 for months, and spending so much in Nikon lenses, I never thought I would *ever* make that statement.)In the end, my advice is to simply rent or borrow the different cameras and try them, ignoring online reviews such as this one. You can go blind reading review after review, get caught up in gear-head stats on the different cameras that have virtually nothing to do with making good pictures, and still make the wrong decision. There is absolutely no substitute for holding the camera and lenses, looking at the output first-hand, and only then making your own *personal* decision.","July 26, 2012",

cameras,Great Camera: Terrible quality control.,Isaac B. Sloan,RTB5CMP177EN1,3,"I ordered my D800 when it first came out and received it last June. It had the dreaded right focus issue and even the center focus points weren't very on. It also had a problem where the shutter or mirror would plash oil onto the sensor. I sent it into nikon which cost me almost $100 dollars with insurance. When I got it back I was happy to see they had corrected these 2 issues. However, I soon noticed that my focus plane seemed to be shifted which caused the focus on right to be behind the subject and the left to be infront of the subject. I just sent it back in again after comparing it with a new camera I bought off amazon a month ago. The new one works great but I'll be sending it back because I can't afford to own 2 $3000 cameras.","July 12, 2013",
cameras,Almost...,Jason Hickman,R5WUNJGNSS51M,3,"I bought the D800 to be my primary camera with my D90 serving as backup. I used it for about 20 days and got some amazing shots with it. I like many of the controls location better than the D90, but it wasn't difficult to transition between the two. I think the unit I received may have had some focusing issues, but the shutter release button definitely fell out. I would have tested the focus more but a $3k body falling apart in less than a month is totally unacceptable in my book. Especially when I read of other people having the same issue and Nikon repair seems to be struggling as well. Thankfully I was within the 30 day return window and Amazon took it back. Sadly I'm stuck with all the batteries, new version of Photoshop (which you must buy to process the RAW files), memory cards, etc... I bought with it. If the D600 is real I may give that a shot, or wait for Nikon to get the bugs worked out of the D800 and try again.","September 7, 2012",
cameras,Huge files and autofocus issues,Paul,R1VDPQYTSO7B5C,3,"I underestimated the size of the files coming out of this camera. Think about this twice prior to jump in. Honestly, unless you go on a safari and need to crop heavily or you print in huge sizes, I see no advantage to have 36MP.The pixel size shows its limitations at 1600ISO (still quite acceptable with a bit of noise removal), but 3200 starts to really show a lot of it.The camera seems to be as well way less tolerable to so-so photographic techniques, let alone fact that my sample seems to suffer from autofocus shifts, ...quite annoying really for a 3k$ camera.Overall not very thrilled. Wanted to go FF from a D2X and D300 background. If I had known would I might have considered moving over to Canon (for smaller MP count, higher ISO handling and from what I have heard no autofocus issues), although I have to say the 14-24 2.8, 24-120 VR 4 and 85 1.4 I fit on the body are truly spectacular when the picture is nailed right.Last, the camera itself feels very solid and extremely well built.

cameras,"Incredible Camera, Incredibly bad QA with the left focus issue",Pat the enthusiast,R3EWIQGHGV6GRU,3,"I would have rated this camera a perfect were it not for the left-focus point issue.The issue is real. I've tested my D800 with the following lenses: - 24mm f/1.4G - 24-70mm f/2.8G - 24-120mm f/4G VR - 16-35 f/4G VRAll of them CANNOT focus on the leftmost AF point correctly at 24mm FL, in AF-S and single point mode. Neither the camera nor the subject to be focus is in motion. The same lenses worked great on the D700. AF fine tune would NOT solve this issue.The center point AF is dead on, the right side AF? ""sharp enough"" but not tack sharp like what you can do with the center AF point.This is unacceptable for a US$3000 camera. We are talking about pro level gear here, not some random toy that cost $300. It is simply ridiculous how this issue escaped any QA, as more and more people are reporting issues.On the plus side:* the resolution of the 36MP sensor is unreal.* 24-70/2.8 (35mm and longer), 85/1.8G, 70-200/2.8 VR2 worked wonders on this camera.* the video files are sharp , crisp and detailed. definitely better than the average camcorder.* AF (aside from the left AF point) is definitely faster and more accurate than D700.* High ISO performance a tad better than D700 as well.To conclude : good luck playing the lottery. My guess is 1 out of 10 D800 have some kind of AF issue.","June 19, 2012",
cameras,"Potentially fantastic camera marred by AF issues, poor Nikon service.",Fabian Gonzales,R3EPBTAFNE8HER,3,"When you purchase this camera, you first and foremost pay for the sensor. And it is an outstanding sensor. It has very high resolution (36MP), very good high-ISO performance, and a color fidelity not seen in previous Nikon digital cameras. The pictures coming from this sensor are downright stunning.The camera features are OK. Only 4FPS, but when you consider the high bandwidth needed for pushing 36MP, that was to be expected. Somewhat disappointingly, Nikon decided to cripple the 16MP DX-format output to just 5FPS, even though the camera clearly is capable of more. You do get ""HD"" video, but I haven't been very impressed by the video output. You certainly aren't getting 2MP of video resolution. Besides, any old camera has video these days.Overall, single lens reflex technology is starting to look old, and Nikon is not doing much innovation to keep it up to date. Even though the D800 has an improved AF module, edge and corner auto-focus points are inaccurate, and even the center AF points can be hit-and-miss. It seems the auto-focus is not able to keep up with the high megapixel count. It would be nice if Nikon offered something like focus-bracketing to compensate for the inaccuracy inherent in using phase-detect auto-focus, but no such luck. Phase-detection AF in general is getting long in the tooth, compared to the new mirror-less cameras out there that offer extremely fast and accurate contrast-detect auto-focus. Nikon's version of contrast-detect AF, available in ""live-view"" mode, is sluggish and inaccurate by comparison.This of course assumes the AF module works in the first place. There is some kind of manufacturing defect with the AF module in the D800, causing the left AF points to be wildly off, especially when using fast wide-angle lenses. I have tried three D800 cameras, and they all have this problem. I strongly suspect this issue affects all D800 camera bodies to varying degrees.Given that your new D800 is likely to have the same AF issue, and given that the sensor is so demanding it will expose every single flaw of every one of your lenses, expect to send both your camera and lenses in to Nikon for service. And this is where the bad news begins.... Nikon service & support is very poor. In my experience, they are slow to respond, and repairs are sloppy. It usually takes a week or even two for technical support to get back to me, and another two-three weeks for service to evaluate the camera or lens. And even then, they almost never take the issue seriously on the first try, meaning you have to send the camera back in for a re-repair, which takes another three-four weeks. My D800 has been in for service twice, and I still have the same auto-focus issue, so I have to send it in a third time. Overall this means I will end up being without my new camera for a total of three months since purchasing it. Be ready for a similar experience! I think this level of service is unacceptable given the price point of this camera, and things have gotten worse since they closed down the El Segundo call center recently.Finally, a note on the D800 and Nikkor lenses: the 36MP D800 sensor exceeds manufacturing tolerance on Nikkor lenses. I have tried multiple copies of the new 85mm f/1.8 for example, and they all show tilted lens elements. The same is the case with the 50mm f/1.8. Same with the new 24-85 f/3.5-4.5 VR. Each type of lens shows it's own kind of deviations, but interestingly, the defects are the same across samples, indicating a manufacturing issue. This isn't necessarily a big deal unless you plan to do landscape photography or other critical work where sharpness across the entire field is important. But it's something to be aware of if you plan to take maximum advantage of the high-resolution sensor. Apart from that, many Nikkor lenses resolve surprisingly well on the D800. You are going to have far more trouble getting sharp pictures due to focusing inaccuracy and camera shake than due to soft lenses!Given the difficulties inherent in taking full advantage of the high-resolution sensor, and the well-known defects with the AF module, it's worth considering carefully if it's worth it before you buy. And keep your old camera for a while after your purchase - you're going to need it while your brand new D800 is being serviced.","July 15, 2012",
cameras,Think long and hard before you buy.,Connor Mallon,RE3NY2FBSEFFN,3,"I'll start off by saying, this is a great camera as far as pictures go; however, there are a lot of ""buts"" when it comes to this machine. 36MP is a whole lotta pixels, and in my experience as a former owner, a lot of pixels leads to a lot of problems.One thing you may want to consider right off the bat, is the file size of these pictures. Transferring and loading files this large can be an arduous task on the fastest computers; be prepared for a time commitment. Another thing.. I'm not sure why all the reviews tend to rave about this camera for low ISO noise, to me this thing is noisy as s***.From day 1 of ownership, I struggled with a frozen viewfinder when shooting in live view mode. I quickly exchanged it for a second D800 with an identical issue. I've heard similar complaints from several friends who own the camera as well, lagging and freezing are hardly anomalies with this beast. Eventually these issues forced me to give up on the camera all together and exchange it for the D600. At just shy of $3000, major hardware issues were not something I was willing to overlook in a brand new camera.The camera takes fantastic images, but unless you plan on making billboard prints, 36MPs seems to be way too high. If money is no object, then by all means grab one, but if you're a struggling photographer this might be one of those instances where you should probably work with what you got or start saving up a little more for something in the D4 arena. I would recommend thinking carefully before purchasing.","May 12, 2013",

cameras,Returned D800 for D700,Jayw,RMP8YY0Q7PNGF,3,"I ordered D800 on Apr 3 and received on Jun 15th. Howerver, when I opened it, the camera has finger prints on the control panel, as well is dirty on the LCD cover. Tested with 85mm/1.8G for portait and the images are generally good, but not outstanding. The big file size does worry me as well. Also tried to test the auto-focus issues but cannot tell for sure.Eventually returned D800, and purchased a D700 from Amazon. Amazon customer service is very nice to help on the return, deserving 5 stars. Hope it is a good decision.","July 19, 2012",
cameras,D800,9star,RXL3DJJWWMUUO,3,"I purchased a new D800 last week, and returned it today. Reason, motion blur! I am used to shooting a D700 at ISO 200 at speeds of 1/40 of a second indoors with no flash. To do this on the D800 you have to bump up the ISO to 6400 in order to avoid motion blur and then because of the high pixel density on the sensor your images are full of chroma noise.Outdoors with a tripod and a good lens and by good I mean something like a Nikon 24-70 2.8, Nikon 14-24 2.8 or Nikon 70-200mm 2.8 VR it performs well with good colour, dynamic range and detail retrieval. It eats most of all the other lens imposters for breakfast although I have anecdotal evidence that Zeiss manual focus lenses are excellent on the camera.Nikon have posted a technical guide for this camera which advises on how to deal with motion blur.So unless you own or intend to use a tripod with this tool, I would try something else and save yourself a lot of headaches. Now where did I put that advert for a used D700??","June 14, 2012",

cameras,JUNK CASE surrounds the best DSLR sensor I've ever used,Andre Gauthier,RAGV9ENCFLM13,3,"This is my second rewrite of my original, somewhat negative, review of the Nikon D800; the others having been written, then revised, at one and six months after purchase. You can see the improvement in my shooting by visiting flickr.com/photos/210rgturbo . There are 700 plus shots taken over four years. I began with a $225 point and shoot Sony. I moved to a fun but ultimately unsatisfactory Lumix super zoom. I then moved to a Nikon D5100 but exchanged it in favor of the D7000. The difference in build was very obvious although the D7000 must NEVER get even slightly wet around the control buttons. Later I borrowed a Canon 5D Mk II for a month and realized that I needed a camera whose ISO capabilities exceeded either the D7000 or the 5D.After a great deal of research and watching the original problems with the focus of the D800 being resolved between 2/12 and 7/12 I bought my D800 in 8/12, I decided it was what I needed for the low light shooting that I love to do.Like the good soldier it is, the D800 has proven to take astonishing pictures right up to ISO 6400, (when there's reasonable light). At night/low light I try and stay between 1600 to 2000 if nothing else is working. Otherwise a very sturdy tripod is required as the shutter used by the D800, especially in viewfinder mode, snaps with ballistics that will blur not only hand held pics, but some tripod mounted pics as well. The user manual states, in smallish print, that the D800 ""needs to be used in Mirror Up mode when the viewfinder is the means of focus"". In very low light there is not enough contrast for Live View mode whose shutter action is entirely different from the viewfinder. If you don't wish to shoot manually in mirror up you can choose to use the ""Exposure Delay Mode"" that lifts the mirror for one, two, or three seconds before then dropping the shutter again. This is very handy if you are not able to use a remote shutter trigger. Why the D7000 has almost no feedback in viewfinder mode seems strange. I wonder if the D4 has this kind of sharp ""snap"" to its view finder setting. The trouble with the ""Exposure Delay.."" is the loss of ability to use the multi shot modes. If you're going to take several shots a second, its best be sure you're at least at 1/500th of a second. I prefer 1/640th as the lowest speed for repeated shots. This tends to completely cancel out the ""bounce"" from the shutter when using the viewfinder.As a resident of New York City I like to go into Central Park or to the Hudson or East Rivers around dawn and take pictures of the birds and other wildlife that is found in those places. What one sees throughout the year is amazing. But the need to shoot as high speeds in this low light is essential. When things work, the shots can be hard to believe considering how long it takes to process the large RAW files. Becoming familiar with the camera to the point that I now know it inside out though it seems there's always something to learn has paid off.Four pro lenses have now replaced the lesser FX and reasonable DX lenses that I already owned. The moment I took my first shots with a the 80-200 ED (non VR) the difference was not only obvious but remarkable. My photography has improved in proportion to each new pro lens that I purchased. The other three are older. The 28-70mm F2.8 ED, the 50mm F:1.8, FX/DX with aperture ring; not as good as the 1.4 but one fourth the price. Lastly an early 70s 300mm Nikkor-H Auto F4.5. The second best part - detail being the first, was the price of $25. If I take a bad photo with one of these four lenses I'm certainly at fault. The trouble I had with the cheaper lenses was a tendency to back focus when I was using faster F stops.Common problem: the 10 pin lower connection on the camera's right side (looking at the front) that is covered by an attached piece of rubber Mine worked GREAT for a radio controlled remote. I could get 300 feet away and take pics with the remote in my pocket! Great for animals who get used to the camera just sitting there. After about 4 months the plug INSIDE the camera came loose and cannot be accessed without opening the entire case and reattaching it. Really? For $3,000? I was told by the NYC authorized Nikon repair people that this is a COMMON PROBLEM. One can use a flash shoe mounted remote, but it TOO must connect to the 10 pin connector. I've been stuck without any kind of remote - a stupid act by Nikon who has so many kinds of ports on the D800 that they could easily have used something else as well in case the 10 pin went bad. You're going to want some sort of remote with the D800....My original and continuing complaint about THIS D800 is a hairline fracture that goes all the way around the Live View screen other sections of the rear camera. Not seeing this for several weeks, I only noticed when I nearly pulled the back completely free from the main body! I pushed it back into place then sealed the camera's cracks with very strong gaffer's tape. I use that tape to hold on an otherwise excellent glass cover for the 3.2"" LCD screen as well. It is used to seal other areas of the camera where non-attached covers fell off like the battery door which is a REAL annoyance. I was handed the camera out of the box at Adorama's NYC store. At the time they had a ludicrous seven day return policy. Thinking Nikon would replace the camera, instead I was told it was caused by impact damage, and since I'd not returned it after the seven days to the store, it was now, according to the unhelpful Nikon folks, my fault; I'd be adding a very high price to the $3,200 I'd just spent to repair a three week old camera that I'd babied so carefully I was amazed at what I was hearing. I was livid. Fortunately, I purchased a warrantee that covered every kind of damage and its good for three years. Wanting to see just how long I could go before it gave up, this camera will go this month (9/13)to be fixed free.I know this is long, but maybe if you're new to such a precision instrument it might be of some help. I'm changing the rating to 4 (though it should be 4.5).Upgrade the firmware as soon as you get yours. The upgrade is on the Nikon site. The 1.0 and 1.1 versions need help though the upgrade doesn't address everything.MEMORIZE THE MANUAL that pertains to what you do. So many people on the street will see the D800 and tell me how great it must be to have such a ""rugged"", ""weatherproof"", ""well built"" camera. None of that is true. Its build quality is average. Is the sensor truly that much more than the D700 which seemed much sturdier.I quote the manual: ""This product is NOT waterproof. Immersion in water"".... (getting it wet)..or exposure to high humidity may cause internal corrosion that cannot be repaired."" Most moisture related problems show up months later.Translation, get caught in a down pour and you'll be paying to fix all those internal parts that get just slightly wet. The cost is terrible. So much for the review I read about taking this camera duck hunting on a drizzly, cold morning. The camera will kick the bucket before the ducks do! I use my camera with EXTREME care these days.So summing up, use only the very best lenses, and experiment like crazy with ISO too. The latest version of Lightroom 5 does very well at settling down noise. I haven't sent mine to be fixed because I love the pictures so much. This is the first of its kind, so its bound to be a mixed affair, regardless of who makes it. Try not to spend $2,999. It can be had for at least $200 less from some places, just be sure you have plenty of time to examine and return it if necessary.","March 27, 2013",

It seemed like this D800 hit the market a full year to 18 months later then we had hoped for, after all my D700 has been in my bag nearly 4 years with no refreshes made,( unlike the D3 & D300 had) when my D800 was finally received, (that's 28 in dog years, or too long in Nikonian years.) After such a long wait I assumed Nikon would have all the bugs worked out by their delivery date, after all the biggest Nikon ""Pro-Testers"" have been providing feedback to Japan since early 2011, so how in the Heck could so many D800 bodies be shipped with this startling LCD Display?Have you seen a D800 yet with the nasty Yellowish-Green Tinted LCD? Well,I have and it's very sad, Unacceptable, but still very sad. I wanted to work through this isuue, so I tweaked the picture styles all the way to magenta and it helped, I also turned off Auto LCD Brightness and set custom white balances to take the Nikon standard previews out of the equation,.......These helped, but did not solve the very undesirable tint cast over each frame.Apparently not all D800s have arrived to customers with this manufacturers flaw, but after reading about the many hundreds that are having this same problem, I decided to return the D800 to Amazon.Amazon is the best on the rare occasion an item of this level must be returned, still, I wished I didn't have to, but this is an expensive tool and it needs to be correct from the start.Nikon has not admitted (as of June 15th 2012) that anything is wrong with any D800 displays, they say it's more correct then my D700 and D3s..........Ahhh, WRONG!!

Photographers who ""must have"" a DSLR are missing the point unfortunately, which is total image quality at an affordable price. At the price of the D800, a pro could get a large format set up with equivalent image resolution of 300mp...ten times the resolution of the D800.

cameras,"Great Low Light Camera, but constant under exposure, wrong white balance, and horrible warranty service.","Sunny ""Sunny Wu (Naturetastic Photography)""",R3NM2C1IKU00YP,3,"UPDATED REVIEW OUT BELOW. AFTER 3 TRIPS TO THE REPAIR CENTER, CANON FINALLY REPAIRED MY CAMERA.I got this camera as a birthday gift this year. It worked great for the first 2 month and I noticed a lot of dust just started sticking to the sensor and isn't falling off. I never had this issue with my Canon EOS 7D which I had for 2 years now. On my Canon EOS 7D, I rarely get dust, and when I do, it usually gets shaken off by the self cleaning unit on the next power cycle. On my Canon EOS 5D Mark III, this never happened. The dust just kept collecting and collecting (the sensor was a dust magnet), so I sensed something was wrong with the self cleaning unit. Not to mention the camera was underexposing 80% of the time. I sent it into the Canon Irvine, CA service center for them to repair it. They adjusted the camera meter. They also adjusted the self cleaning sensor unit (so it was malfunctioning) and did a sensor clean. When I got it back, I noticed they left a bunch of residue and dust on my sensor (more than what I had before). The self sensor cleaning unit did nothing to it. Canon support gave me a shipping label back to get it fixed. So I sent it back in. A week later I got it back, not only was my sensor dirtier (I have test shots), they also left several scratches across the back of my camera and on the side! I contacted Canon support again. They gave me a label to ship it back in to get all the problems fixed. Now they want me to pay almost $280 for replacement parts even though all these issues happened because of the camera malfunction and due to the repair center worker's carelessness! To add insult to injury, I shared this repair story on their Facebook page. Instead of replying me to make things right, they just deleted my post all together. Very scammy company, do not recommend buying their products. I will attempt to work things out with their customer support. Will keep you guys posted. Also Canon, if you are reading this, having to send in my camera in for repair for the same issues (and issues introduced during the repairs) 3 times is very unacceptable.To people who says the reviews are about the products and not the repair centers. It is about the product. Not only is my camera screwed up on the basic functions of a digital camera, don't count on Canon to honor their in-warranty repairs (which is part of the product you buy). If you get a defective Canon EOS 5D Mark III, guess what? You are out $3500+tax!Update 7-11-2013:After 3 trips to Canon's repair center (still pretty ridiculous how they didn't get it right the first time), they have adequately fixed my camera. While there are still a few dust spots on the sensor, they are barely noticeable, so they did clean my camera to an acceptable level. It seems CPS handled my repair this time as my camera came back in a CPS bag. Also they have decided to replace the scratched up parts (caused by the repair center) for free after I complained to their Facebook page. Since my camera is usable now, I will need to take this camera and shoot before I can give a full review on the product. Right now I have upped my review to 3 stars and I doubt I will ever give it a 5 star rating due to the fact that the I had to send the camera in 3 times to get an in-warranty repair correct. If the warranty is part of the product you buy, Canon needs to be able to honor that warranty before the customer needs to make complaints online.MAIN REVIEW HERE (10-15-2013):I will not raise my star rating from 3/5 on this camera due to the problems I am about to describe in this review and the horrible warranty service I received. This is an okay camera, and can work very fast in continuous shutter mode. The focus tracking is very fast and I have used it on quick moving subjects and it hits the mark 95% of the time. Also, I can use this camera up to ISO 6400 with no issue in low light. While a bit grainy, there is barely any image noise even at ISO 6400. There is also no noise even during long exposures. I only spotted around 5 tiny ""hot pixels"" after a 4 minute long exposure. The camera has a built in ""quiet mode"" which kind of works. It suppresses the mirror slap noise, and I have used a few times outside around wildlife. While it does make a sound, ambient noise is enough to cover over it! Sometimes, I accidentally fire off 2 shots in this mode because I didn't hear the mirror. Also, this camera is incredibly rugged, and I have shot with it in rain and under waterfalls. No water got in and it performs very well (just make sure you have a weatherproofed lens too!). The only few issues that still persists in this camera is underexposure and white balance. My camera still constantly underexposes 2/3 to 1 stop around 75% of the time even though the light meter has already been checked and adjusted several times at the repair center during that self sensor cleaning problem. Also, I have noticed that the auto white balance is always off especially in day light. All my photos always have a blue cast on them and I always have to white balance off of something I know is white when I process my RAW files.Pros:- Rugged construction. Good weatherproofing.- Quiet mode does make some noise, however ambient noise is enough to cover it.- Great low light high ISO performance. Works great up to ISO 6400.- Low noise during long exposures.- Very fast at focusing and focus tracking.Cons:- Constant under exposure by 2/3 to 1 stop 75% of the time even though repair center has checked meter several times.- Inaccurate auto white balance.- Horrible warranty repairs and service.Overall, I am not too happy with the camera and would not recommend this product, and believe that Canon has to work out the big bugs in the system and also need to get some better repair technicians in their factory.","July 8, 2013",
cameras,Good but not worth the upgrade,"Jason Tu ""Dog Photo Man""",R19N58OHLLOQ6H,3,"5D Mark iii is a fine camera, but I don't think that it is worth the upgrade if you already have 7d or 5d Mark ii or 1d Mark IV. I have two reasons:1) Low light focus, you get full frame, better focus (even though the low light is not that great - I tried at ISO 25600, the focus went crazy. I can't get it focused at all). Comparing my old 5d mark ii, it is no better. It is only better when the light is good and the object being shot is moving then Mark iii performs better). My 1d Mark IV is actually quicker in focusing though at 16 meg pixel. True, the IOS quality has been raised from 6400 to 12800 low light wise between 1d mark iv and 5d mark iii. You still need a flash to have a good picture at ISO 12800 for 5d Mark III. The occasion of shooting at this low light is not that common, say maybe 10-20% of your overall shooting. I see improvement but not big enough to buy Mark iii instead of Mark II. Buying a used 1D Mark IV can be a better idea if you are talking about low light shooting and auto focus.2) Cost - 7d is less than 2k, new 1d mark IV is 4.5K, Nikon d800 is 3k (with flash, better low light, faster focus). After looked at the features and the images taken, I am not sold on 5d Mark III. It is good but not good enough to be $500 than D800, $1.75k more than 7d. The full frame is fine but unless you develop pictures that big, 1.3x or 1.6x offered by 1d mark iv and 7d are enough for you if we talk about the picture quality only.Pros - more focus points, 3.2 view finder, better video, better weather protectionCons - not worth the 1k premium over 5d mark II or 1.75k over 7d, low light focus in need of improvement, not features competitive with Nikon d800I returned mine and decide to keep my 1d mark iv and wait for the next upgrade opportunity.","April 6, 2012",
cameras,"Great camera for some, overpriced for many, decent AF 3 years too late",GM,R20FWUUC8F733L,3,"Short summary:* If you shoot a lot of action, 5dMkIII is a better camera (compared to 5dMkII, 7D, Nikon D800). (5 stars).* If you mainly shoot landscape or still subjects *and* are starting a FF system, I'd strongly suggest checking out Nikon D800. It's $500 cheaper and has better IQ (4 stars).* If you're a hobbyist getting into FF *and* don't need 1DX-class AF, I'd strongly recommend 5dMkII. It's $1400 cheaper with nearly identical IQ in raw images (3 stars).* If you already own 5dMkII, don't shoot much action and other MkIII features don't interest you (silent shutter, better build, brighter viewfinder etc), wait until the next generation or a sizable price drop. As is, too pricey (3 stars).I pre-ordered MkIII when the camera was announced, after seeing Canon's claims that the IQ was improved about 2 stops compared to 5dMkII. Having spent a few days with it, I can say that 5dMkIII is a great camera. The body feels more solid than its predecessor. The new 7D-style viewfinder is brighter. The new AF works wonderfully especially in low light and with the outer focus points. However, I don't see the 2-stop IQ improvement in raw images using Lightroom. At best, the IQ has been improved marginally. Only in-camera JPGs show substantial improvement, which I don't use.As is, the camera's biggest selling point is AF. I don't think the upgrade from 5dMkII is worth it unless you frequently photograph moving subjects or need 1DX-class AF. Why 3 stars? First off, 5dMkII has pretty similar IQ to 5dMkIII in raw images. However it has an outdated AF unit (a poor design choice by Canon), which is not an obstacle for most people including myself. Second, Nikon D800 sells for $500 less, and it offers as much as MkIII does if not more. Given the more reasonably priced alternatives, and the incremental IQ improvement from much-cheaper 5dMkII, I can only rate this one 3 stars (for people in my position).

I love everything about the camera but there is a fatal flaw that renders the camera unusable for video work. The camera will only record 29 minutes and 59 seconds of video before it stops! I called technical support and they said it does this because in some countries there is a higher tax on video cameras (which are defined as a camera that can record video for more than 30 minutes in one take) so they artificially limit the camera to 30 minutes of shooting in one take. That's all fine and good until your next assignment is to film a rock concert or a wedding ceremony. I suppose you could just ask the band to take a little break at 29:59 into the show so you can restart the camera....Couldn't they make some kind of work around for those of us in the US, like Panasonic does with their cameras?","September 25, 2012",

cameras,"Best compact camera ever, but...",Momojojo,RF53TVLA0UXHN,3,"I sold my NEX-5N 3 month ago after hearing rumors and seeing per-production photos of NEX6. I loved the NEX5N output but hated the menu system and lack of physical controls, the 6 appeared to be my holy grail. Anyhow, in the meantime I wanted a compact none interchangeable lens camera to fill my camera needs. I gave the RX100 a shot after all the rave reviews. After using it for 2 month here is my opinion:1. Image quality is the best out of all compact cameras I've used in recent years. Recent compacts I've used: Panasonic LX5, Olympus XZ1, Canon S100, Sony HX9V.2. Image quality is almost on par with micro43 + kit lens and very close to the NEX5N jpg output. Recent m43 I've used: OMD e-M5, EP3 and GX1.3. Focus speed - almost no shutter lag or focus hunting unlike compact P&S.; The overall speed is on par with mirrorless cameras.So what didn't I like?1. Image stabilization doesn't work well under indoor light which result in slightly blurred photos. The flash also takes roughly 3-4 seconds to recharge which is a bit frustration for me when taking bounced flash indoor photos of a people in slight motion. Without flash any slight moving of the model or your hands will cause blurry photo. I felt compact camera were a lot more responsive taking indoor flash photos than the RX100.2. The size - it is really compact considering the image quality it packs, but it is a tad too big to fit in a jean pocket comfortably. It does fit, but extremely snug and will require some effort to dig out. I'm always afraid of accidentally hitting the power button causing the lens to extend and break in my pocket. So the camera is pocket-able but I wouldn't recommend putting it in your pants pocket (i put it in my pants because I don't carry any bags/man-purse when I go out). You can also put it in your jacket, but it's weight will make your jacket slant to one side. To safely carry this camera you will probably put it on a neck strap or put it in a bag of some sort, so technically portability is no longer in it favor when compared to other mirrorless solutions in this price range that provide better image quality that are only slight bigger in size/weight.3. Form factor - the camera is built like a compact point and shoot, and I feel like I'm shooting with one. I don't know how to explain it but psychologically i put a lot more thoughts in composing my shots using a mirrorless IL form factor compared to point and shoot. I find the photo I took with RX100 to be more casual and less interesting than the ones I took with a mirrorless. I guess I was more careless and didn't enjoy shooting with RX100 as much as a mirrorless.So, all in all, once you used this camera you will never be able to accept the photos quality and speed of a compact point and shoot again. It is a great step up from a P&S; if you have the $ to spare. As a secondary camera to your mirrorless or DSLR this is a great compact choice. However, at this price range I would not recommend this as a primary camera as there are a lot of options that offer more flexibility and better image quality.","December 12, 2012",

Image Quality was stunning - rivaled the Olympus OMD EM5.Was constantly amazed that something this small could rival m4/3.Sony really knocked it out of the park.Sadly, after 4 months of ownership a very conspicuous dust spot appeared on the sensor - too big and too central to simply forever clone out - suggesting that either the seal of the lens was inadequate or debris was in-camera at time of manufacture.I kept the RX100 in a small Lowe Pro case with belt loop. I take care of my optical gear. I have owned dozens of compact cameras over the years and have never encountered a dust problem with a fixed lens camera.Was very disappointed - again, the camera is a marvel - especially at this price point.Despite the time frame Amazon graciously supported me (Amazon gets 5 Stars in this saga).

cameras,Lots of technology but a lousy User Interface.,Thomas F. Burchill,R2IA5OFUMX8KCZ,3,"I took this camera to Europe for a month long trip and came home with some amazing images. Hard to believe a rinky-dink little camera could do so much. I found the auto HDR extremely valuable in dealing with difficult contrasty/dim lighting situations such as the inside of Cathedrals and castles. The low light performance at the wide end was also astonishing. There are indeed many pros for the this camera which are detailed in the other reviews here. My biggest gripe of all? The menu structure and user interface are simply terrible. This has got to be the least organized and least intuitive menu interface I've seen. I think what has happened here is that the plethora of mode/function options has exponentially exploded in this camera while Sony tried to reduce the number of hard buttons at the same time. Everything is assignable, but you can get into trouble if you customize it too much. For example, I assigned exposure compensation to the button that is default labeled drive mode/self timer. Two months later when I actually needed to use the self-timer, I went into the menus looking for self-timer and could find no such menu item! Frustrating minutes later, I looked under the menu item ""drive mode"" and finally found the ""self-timer"" function hidden there. By this time, it was too late to use the self-timer function as the photo opportunity had passed. Sony could take some serious lessons from Canon when it comes to user friendliness of the UI. In short, this camera has a steep learning curve until you can quickly make it do what you want at a moments notice. That said, to be able pocket this much technology is amazing to me but this not a ""quick-learn"" camera if you want to master its bag of tricks.","August 20, 2013",

I have never had any electronics that died on me because of this reason. I expected more from Sony. Olympus XZ-1 has been working strong for years even though it has been in tougher weather situations. This camera is not sealed very well.

I walked in rain with an umbrella, and the camera could not have gotten wet, if anything was subject to humid conditions. Sony said extensive corrosion, not economically viable to fix. Offered me a 10% discount and when I refused, the Laredo TX service center said they could offer a new one @ $300. I took the deal but very unhappy the camera could have been ruined by what seems a normal event. I owned numerous cameras over the years and have used them on a rain forest and much more humid conditions including direct contact with rain.Within the week after agreeing to repurchasing the camera, I found out they came up with the rx 100 II; tried to see if paying the difference of $150 I could get the new model but they gave me the run around by talking to different departments.

Although it doesn't have all the advantages or bells and whistles of my DSLR, it fits in my pocket. Rather than miss shots (going for a late night street stroll, meeting friends or dining out) I have this with me. In fact, after getting used to it, I took only this camera on a weeklong trip to Mexico and it worked great. The RX100 has a ton of manual controls but also has a good ""point and shoot"" mentality for when you want to turn your brain off. I don't publish dozens of photos to Facebook so I post-process every photo I print. For me, that means shooting in RAW which the RX100 does. The bigger sensor means I can get a clear and detailed photo when I blow up to 16x20 (the largest I have printed so far with this camera.) There are plenty of reviews of this camera both here and on the net so for my 2 cents:1) This isn't a camera for everyone, you are paying for RAW, a fairly fast lens and bigger sensor2) The RX seems to go through the battery fairly quickly, so buy a couple of spares3) As others have mentioned, the start video button is inconveniently located and easy to turn on accidently4) The camera has lots of features, I found a secondary handbook on how to use it, was helpfulIf you want a cheap point and shoot, you'd probably do better looking elsewhere. If you really enjoy photography but want some convenience, seriously consider this camera.Okay, I used this camera for 10 months and took over 2,000 photographs with it. No problem...... loved it. Suddenly it began to insert a multicolor line (up to 3) through the center of the photograph. In the last 200 or so I've shot, it has happened about 15 times. I sent the camera back to Sony with a card it in with the defective photos. They said the camera passed their tests and the problem is the software I use to view the pics. (Really, I use 2 nationally known photo editors and it didn't this for any of the other 2,000 pics I took with it.) They did not look at the pics I sent in.... just the ones they took. Great camera for 10 months, but little to no support from Sony. The camera gets 5 stars, Sony support gets 1 star.... average equals 3 stars.

Although there are drawbacks like no filter threads, short focal range (28-100mm) and slow lens at max zoom (f4.9 @ 100mm) I can live with these. But the main drawback is the camera frequently powers on by itself in my pocket and I sometimes find the battery has been completely run down when I go to use the camera.

It works, and the resolution is fine, but several things about it bother me.It can only display the electronic level OR the histogram; not both at the same time. When you adjust the exposure compensation, the histogram disappears momentarily. I have to cycle through the display options to get from one to the other.My Canon G12 and SX50 HS display both level and histogram simultaneously. I use both when I'm taking a shot. I know the S100 didn't have a level. I'm not sure about the S110.The ""movie"" record button is easily accidentally activated, since that's where your thumb naturally falls. I've almost gotten used to avoiding it.I wish it had a neutral density filter. I didn't check the specs before ordering it; my bad!When powering it down, it takes a long second, at least, before the lens retracts.This camera slows down my shooting.

cameras,Good but not great,Mr. X,R1YQYBFGCLBFBL,3,"BIGGEST CON: Only goes to F11 - any serious photographer will not even consider this camera because of this.I got this camera as a Christmas present. The primary use for me is in a housing to be used while scuba diving. I will say that for the above water pictures I have taken I am quite impressed with it. Overall the camera has a good feel (solid/sturdy/metal feel), but there's not a real good ""hand grip"" like the DSLRs have, which is disappointing. I can understand the desire to keep it small, but it would have been nice to just have a mounting point to put on a handle so one hand could hold the camera nicely.So far I have taken 2 (scuba diving) trips with it. The initial trip I used one of my son's strobes (Inon Z240) and a L&M; Sola 1200 as a Video/flood light. For my 2nd trip I purchased 2 S&S; D1 Strobes.This is my first foray into underwater photography using a ""camera"". Up until now I carted a long a L&M; Video Housing for my Sony HDR-HC3 Hi Def video camcorder. This can also take pictures but only at 4 MP (it's not a new camera by any stretch of the imagination). But since I didn't have to worry about any settings I used it pretty much like a point & shoot.My first week was on a Digital Shootout sponsored by BackScatter on Cozumel in late April. We had some instruction on uw photography, but, as I quickly found out, nothing beats just getting in the water and shooting, shooting, shooting. I set my RX100 on Aperture Priority (as recommended) and played around. My picture quality is anywhere from pretty decent to horrible. I still need quite a bit more time to flesh out all the operations of this thing. That would be true for almost any camera these days - the electronics in them provides so much functionality that learning it is almost a bit overwhelming.*** During my experience I did notice one HUGE hole in the camera's capabilities and that is that it is limited to F11. Both of my sons cameras have a better range and they are much older than this one so it's more than a bit disappointing. The two other cameras (FYI) are an Olympus PEN-1 (12 mp) in an Olympus housing (Z240 & S2000 strobes) and a Canon T2i in an Aquatica Housing (which has caused us NO END of problems due to extremely poor design) with one single D1 strobe and a L&M; Sola 1200 Video/Flood light. Even the older PEN-1 Olympus goes to an aperture of F22.I also got the macro and wide angle UW lenses that mated to the housing. I still have to review some of these pictures but getting to within an inch or so of some of these tiny subjects is just amazing. I did have one issue with the Wide Angle Lens but since this is all UW related I won't burden you with it here.So, time will tell whether I keep using this as a primary camera or buy a real DSLR and relegate this to a backup function.BTW, for those other users complaining about no external battery charger - you can buy one (it came in my package). It has a flip down two prong plug and can also double as a generic USB charger (there's a switch on the front) which may be convenient for some people.","July 3, 2013",

There's a lot of marketing around, but the reality is it's just an advanced P&S.; Don't expect it will be on par with DSLR or mirrorless cameras. I made a huge mistake when ordered RX100. This was a present for my wife. After reading the reviews and specs there was an impression that in good light conditions it's possible to get IQ similar to IQ of my old NEX5. Not even close! Too many things is wrong with this camera. Poor lens with huge barrel distortion, inaccurate autofocus (very fast though), mediocre AWB, terrible image artifacts even for small ISOs, poor JPEG quality (use RAW instead), too many megapixels for this sensor size, no grip. And you get all this for more than $500. I see only too objective pros: compactness and unusually large sensor for this type of camera. Are these big advantages? It's questionable. RX100 is not much smaller than, say, NEX 3N with a pancake lens. Big sensor should result in a good IQ. To my taste the IQ is not impressive at all. The sensor definitely has a potential, but IQ also depends on the quality of lens and on how you process the data and it seems like these two parts are screwed.I am very disappointed after all. I am returning the camera and ordering NEX 3N with the pancake zoom instead for $350. Yes, I know this is probably the worst e-mount lens, but honestly I don't see any other options taking into account the need for something really compact.","December 27, 2013",

It means, you can't see what you are shooting under sunshine.Maybe it was designed for low light only. If so - you will have deal with noise, which any compacts have if ISO setting is higher than 800, or even 400. Also, if you use camera without viewfinder, you are loosing stability providing by position of the camera pressed to your face2. Camera is very small and therefor is not very comfortable in hands.3.

Both my cameras are giving me perfect images, both have perfect viewfinders, full manual controls, well designed menus and many more, while Panasonic also has perfect Leica 24x zoom with f/2.8 throwout the whole zoom range and perfect optical stabilizer.Maybe Sony RX100 will be good for some people, but I prefer tonot recommend it to my friends.","May 29, 2013",

I told her that while I understand that power is being used to maintain the clock and settings, it should be reasonably obvious that it is a defect if at night the battery is fully charged and then the next day when I first turn it on, it already shows half empty (and in another day or so, it's fully discharged). I was then advised to call the Sony Hotline Support Team.So I did. The Sony support team person was very professional and eager to help but the problem at this point is not yet resolved. At first I was advised to always remove the battery when not using. I told her that having a full battery discharge to half just overnight in a camera that's off is ridiculous. She seems to understand and agree and after checking a couple of things told me that she will be sending me a new battery. I asked if this problem is a known problem in their database and that this is the recommended solution to it, she admitted that they don't have information on such a problem yet and that hopefully the battery is the problem and to try it out and if it doesn't work to call them again and at that time maybe I may need to send in my unit to Sony for fixing.Just a little bummed that my $650 camera has a serious flaw that Sony says they're not even aware of yet.","October 2, 2012",
cameras,Horrible P&S; with excellent sensor. Can't use flash and zooming (effectively),uzevla,R20F699BOW1J0P,3,"This camera now costs around 400$ which is very similar price to e.g. Canon S120.I expect more and more people will jump in to buy one due to all these remarkable reviews and the price.The very first thing you should know: if a pocketable camera is not a must for you, there are just too many better choice out there. There is plenty of small m43s that can fit a very small waist pouch.To start with some good things: RX100 will give you excellent video and pictures of landscape/buildings on a nice sunny day. It also has an excellent LCD.However, I have other, better, travel cameras. I needed this one for around the house(e.g. kids parties...) and that's where this camera ultimately fails: kids are running around, in and out of shade, sometimes facing the sun on the beach so fill in flash is the must. RX100 has the recycle speed of no less than 5 sec which is on par with... well, nothing is that bad. More importantly, I was hoping that the recycle speed will be faster if the flash compensation is at minimum. And yes, it is faster - in continuous shooting mode it's around 2sec. But if you keep the flash at minimum, and don't shoot in continuous mode (with your finger on the button all the time) , it's still 5sec. An obvious bug in SW that kills this camera.The second bad thing is the mediocre lens. There is a few reviews available elsewhere telling you which focal lengths work well with different apertures. This helps getting good pictures on a nice sunny day where you can clearly see the power of this sensor. However, as soon as you are close to the zoom end, or your subject is in the shade, forget about it - the picture quality is so inconsistent that really nothing helps. In fact, I have never seen a good picture coming out of this camera (had two) on the zoom end.The are also many other small quirks - no iso limit, no shutter speed limit (two features every enthusiast camera has for ages...). Also, you must rotate the lens ring some 10 times to go through all the focus range. Ridiculous...This would be a 2 star camera for me especially because the manufacturer is an electronics company which only cares about good marketing, not making some good photo equipment (at least in this range, including nex cameras where they offer the worst collapsible zoom kit lens, probably worth 20$, which they then sell with something powerful like nex6). Sony simply knows that the average Joe will fall for the small size and an excellent sensor so the lens can be a pure crap.However, I give this camera 3 stars since Panasonic, Olympus and especially Fuji don't offer anything pocketable.

cameras,"Very slow, but a nice camera to carry around",Robert Patton,RRHK27XM1D7H0,3,"I purchased this camera to be a sort of daily driver, carry it around with the family to get the occasional photo rather than our larger DSLR (rebel xti). I generally agree with the reviews of all the positive qualities given by people here, I used it extensively over the past few weeks and easily prefer it to using a newer iPhone for pics. Compared to the DSLR, I'm probably not knowledgeable enough to tell all of the differences in the end result, but I don't notice anything where I think geez I wish I'd taken that one with the xti. I do want to note two problems I've had that I don't see getting mentioned much: powering it down can take 30-60 seconds for the lens to retract, which is just sort of odd since it happens about half the time but the other times it shuts down and closes in say 3 seconds. Also perhaps 1/5 of the time there is a long delay between pressing the shutter button and it actually taking the picture, maybe 30 seconds. This in multiple situations, but for ex. Outdoors bright light, no zoom and just a scenery shot. And no, obviously I don't have any delay set. So ultimately I like it, but the convenience of the size is offset by these weird issues with slowness and that is annoying at times.","December 26, 2012",
cameras,Some options hurt ...,J. C. Nicholas,R31OM4QDDKPCA3,3,"I want to start by saying this camera does everything it says it does, so if you want to read the good stuff about it, check the 4 and 5 star reviews. I want to concentrate on the things I dislike.I don't like not having a view finder. Wearing polarized sunglasses often makes it difficult to see the screen, including the zillion camera options presented on the screen.I really liked my Canon PowerShot S95 10 MP Digital Camera with 3.8x Wide Angle Optical Image Stabilized Zoom and 3.0-Inch LCD because it satisfied my photography needs about 90+% of the time, but lost it last year. I purchased the Sony mainly because of the advanced shutter, aperture and focus controls thinking it would satisfy my needs 99% of the time. And it probably would, if I wasn't so ""carefree and careless"" in the point-n-shoot mode.During some group photos at our Thanksgiving celebrations, the camera didn't always detect every face. Result: Some of the closer persons were out of focus. Yes, this was my fault, but I expected it would use a more generic point-n-shoot everything-in-focus mode. Now I use a little more time getting the correct depth of field and focus, but it's a ""bit"" frustrating.While doing some nighttime shooting at the Denver Zoo-Lights, I got some great shots - shots that would have probably required a tripod for other compact point-n-shoot cameras. The only complaint I had was the occasional shot with persons, persons that the camera could not detect because of the darkness. Result: The surprisingly powerful flash, coupled with exposure compensations, gave me grossly overexposed and unrecoverable faces. I'm not sure how one would compensate for that.The most disappointing experience was at the National Western Stock Show. Somehow the camera got on one of its functions that I think should be reserved for photo software. I will try to upload one of the pictures of my wife and grandson. Result: No usable pictures. Hey, if you're going to include bizarre functions, the camera still should keep and unaltered version.I admit these are operator error - my fault. And, I hate to admit, I'm probably a better than average photographer *BUT* when I want to be lazy and use the camera as a point-n-shoot, I don't want surprises. I miss my Canon PowerShot S95. It was smaller, had a viewfinder, and I made less mistakes.For those who think this camera is a bit too big, I use Sony Jacket Case for Cyber-shot RX100 *BUT* instead of using the strap, I use a clip similar to this *Silver Tone Metal Trigger Lobster Clasp Key Chain Keyring 2 Pcs and clip the camera to my belt.

cameras,"Taking a picture seems very good, but what follows falls short",marcoherman,R19KVDPZV4TIC9,3,"To start off, Sony deserves a demerit for not providing a hard copy of a lengthy user's manual. Many of us don't want to be tied to a laptop or desktop, or have a really good tablet, and/or pay for data usage with a good download speed in the many situations where we want to look at a manual.More importantly... I still have not had time to explore the many potential and sophisticated complications available when taking a picture with this camera. But I can say with disgust that Sony has done a miserable job of constructing the software for manipulating files afterward.When I look at the contents of the SD card while it is in the camera and connected via USB to my PC, I clearly see folders that have been named with the date of the shoot (a useful default, I presume). I know what folders are almost universally considered to be, and these are presented as though they are folders, although these folders do not appear if I take the SD card out of the camera and plug it directly into my PC.And it is easy to copy one or more of these folders to my PC using Windows Explorer. But it is not possible to delete a folder on the SD card/camera while examining it via Windows Explorer.I spent a half hour carefully searching a pdf of the entire lengthy manual trying to find a way to select a folder and then delete the entire folder in one swoop. I thought I had done just that with a selected folder when I clicked OK to delete ""All in Folder"". Instead the camera deleted all the pictures on the entire card. Fortunately I had previously copied most pictures of interest to my PC (I think).The almost complete absence of thought and work put into these important aspects of using a digital camera, beyond the initial action of taking the picture, translates into a mediocre product rating.And to add insult to injury, the folders themselves are still there - there is just nothing in any of them. I am still left with the mystery of how to delete them. (Again, they don't appear as such when exploring the SD card directly, so I don't see how to delete them there.)","April 14, 2013",

cameras,falls short of hype,rj45,R2ULX84CTNC1M1,3,"I had high expectations for the sony rx100 after seeing all the rave reviews, and the specs. I got it and tried it for last two days with different indoor shots, took about 100 shots total. The result: image quality is about the same as my two year old nikon s8100 which cost me 250usd back then. Sorry folks, but it's all hype and clever marketing.I can't tell much difference between pictures taken by rx100 vs my s8100. The main difference I notice is much bigger jpeg files about 4-5 MB in size vs 2 MB. Unless I care to zoom and crop the image, or blow it up to poster size, I don't see any point in buying and keeping the rx100, and don't see the benefit of having 20mb pixel. The colors on the rx100 are too cool, and I prefer warmer colors like those produced by canon. The lens are fast, but only if you don't zoom and don't use flash. Shot to shot with flash on was a pity, almost 2 to 4 seconds lag in between depending on the charge level of the battery and amount of zoom. SLRs are a different animal because you can get great shots without flash, but not your average point and shoot. The battery drained much faster than I expected. Grip is not so good because the body is too smooth. What's worse? The rx100 struggled to focus on some of the macros I tried especially with full zoom. The 3.6x zoom is simply not sufficient; 7x to 10x zoom is needed for taking pics of anything out of your reach such as a water lilly in a pond, or a singer far away on stage in a concert.For a 650usd camera, I can't justify keeping it unless I'm overwhelmingly impressed and pleased by all the features. At this price level, I would recommend skipping this camera and go for a real SLR instead. I'm waiting for the next generation of the sony nex 5n.","August 15, 2012",

You need a camera bag (sold separately) in order to properly carry it around without damaging it.So, what we really have here is an eight-hundred dollar camera.Two flimsy-looking but apparently effective little ""straps"" are included. These are supposed to be inserted in the two teeny-weenie little slots on either side of the camera. But the straps are too big to be easily (or any other way) slipped through the slots. I am utterly at a loss here. I cannot for the life of me figure out how to get these things into the slots provided.

Nearly every common operation takes longer in finder than exlorer, many operations and configurations are as far from 'intuitive' as anything in Windows (much further in some cases). Yes the O.S. is more stable (just), but can't say the same for much of the software - and the lack of good quality, free software is disappointing (even good quality paid software is harder to find).I've been using it for about 6 months now so it can't just be lack of familiarity. There are so many areas in which OS X is flawed or lacking compared to Windows that I can only conclude that the mac's reputation for usability is pure bluff and hype. The thing that's saved the macbook for me is installing vmware fusion so that I can run XP on it. Could have got a really sweet Windows-based notebook for the price though!","November 9, 2007",

Oils from one's hands can smudge the polycarbonate case but the avidity of dirt is less an issue with the black model. The glossy screen is sharp with great color saturation but the glare from it in brightly lit rooms is somewhat distracting.

laptops,"The Good, The Bad, and the Shiny",Robert M. Brown,R21IXVOXMC9GO1,3,"The new MacBook Pro has some significant advantages over the old one. The new case design is attractive and solid. The keyboard is crisp and responsive. The hard drive is as easy to access as on every other notebook on the market (as opposed to requiring complete disassembly of the machine with the old model). The new NVIDIA 9600 graphics adds a lot of 3D horsepower.There are some significant drawbacks as well. The video output for connecting an external monitor is only compatible with one monitor at the moment. Connecting to the kinds of monitor that people actually own will require the purchase (and carrying) of an additional $30 adapter. Or two, if you need to connect to both VGA and DVI monitors.The new MacBook Pro actually has two video adapters; the NVIDIA 9400 and 9600. The system uses the 9400 by default, which is less powerful than the 9600 but uses less power. The 9400 is an integrated adapter without its own memory; it uses 256MB of the system RAM. The problem is that it uses that 256MB RAM even when the system is using the 9600 adapter. In other words, these laptops effectively have 256MB less RAM than the previous generation.The new display is very clear and sharp, at least as good as the previous generation's screen. It is also covered with a pane of glass and is very, very shiny; much shinier and more reflective even than the previous generation's 'glossy' screen. If the lighting conditions in your work environment are exactly right, the screen looks wonderful. If there is any light behind or above you, the screen acts as a mirror and the glare and reflections can be very annoying.The new MacBook Pro is a wonderful computer, but it is not a clear upgrade from the previous version and the mirror finish of the new screen means that no one should buy this computer without actually trying it first.","October 27, 2008",
laptops,"Beautiful computer, some mixed feelings",Jacek R. Ambroziak,R1P8JNZVCBFHR7,3,"This is my first Apple computer ever. I am a software developer who mostly used Unix (Solaris) and Linux, rarely venturing into Windows land mostly for Nikon Scan and Photoshop. For a long time I believed Macs were for graphics/video designers, rather than hard core developers. The fact that I've seen lots of MacBooks at conferences such as Web 2.0 in SF, did not convince me enough: I attributed the widespread use of them to a fad, a certain ""style"" as in clothing. For me a computer is a ""knowledge worker's tool"" not a fashion statement. Another reason to stay away from Apple products has been high margin pricing. CPUs, GPUs, memory, disks, are quickly getting cheaper, and yet Apple sells these commodities like luxury goods. One can configure a beautiful Lenovo laptop with more horsepower for much cheaper (I've done it recently for a friend).So why do it?Here are MY reasons. 1) I needed MAC OS X to port some of my applications to the Mac, maybe go into iPhone development too. 2) I needed *some* laptop (for mobility) to replace my historic trusty Dell Inspiron 8000. Most of my work happens on a custom built desktop. 3) I am not much of a Windows fan and I am a bit tired of Linuxes; I wanted inspiration from something I haven't used before: to learn and expand knowledge/experience horizons.So that's where I am coming from...After 3 weeks of usage I can say the following (you will notice the mixed feelings from the title of this review)This is a computer of *stunning* beauty! It is a work of art: the screen, the keyboard, the body; it belongs on a permanent exibition at the MoMA. As such it is a joy to use and have around, it brightens my daily experience. And yet... why such a small screen resolution (1440x900) for a 15 inch screen?! Even my historic Dell from 2001 sported 1600x1200, great for working with text and hi-res photos. For this kind of money we should be getting higher resolution. I am not talking about numbers for numbers' sake: the font characters (even as I write this) are far from print quality, issues with anti-aliasing software may have something to do with this. Within the first couple of hours I practically decided to return the laptop because of how text looks 70% of the time. It is difficult to understand why Apple is saving on pixels here and impairs an otherwise great product. Is it because higher resolutions are reserved for even pricier models? Apart from the not-so-great-a-resolution (you may google around for other people's opinions on that), pricing is somewhat annoying too (and also discussed in many places on the Web). To connect an external monitor you need a $30 or $100 additional cable. To upgrade to a much more reasonable 4GB of RAM you'll need $100+ (or $300 if you want this commodity to have Apple sign on it :-) )But... I decided to keep the laptop. It is too beautiful, and I find MAC OS ""Leopard"" intriguing and a good experience. Then there are other pluses: the keyboard (back-lit w/ smooth key action), great network connectivity, convenient weight and dimensions, glossy screen (I don't have issues with reflections other reviewers mention). From the developer's perspective, I learn some good things and some not so good: apparently I can't just download my Java from Sun (say 32-bit Java 6); I have to live with what Apple endorses :-(Amazon/UPS delivery was fantastic, packaging is beautiful too: they both made for a very pleasant and exciting experience.Summary: I am not returning the laptop, I enjoy its beauty and functionality, but if I didn't need MAC OS for my planned work, I would have stayed in the higher value priced PC-land (eg. Lenovo + Ubuntu) where you can customize parameters better and avoid hefty margins.A FEW DAYS LATER: With MiniDisplayPort to DVI adapter (another $30) I connected the laptop to my 1600x1200 Sony LCD monitor. The text characters can still look pretty bad, eg. equals sign = with grey area between the horizontal segments. The bad news is that the higher resolution did not heal the issue: the good news: perhaps this is a software issue to be solved with a system update -- I hope.","January 8, 2009",

It feels cheap, and the computer runs so hot that I have to put a magazine under it to balance it on my lap. It really, really runs hot. I also don't like the old-fashioned matte screen, having been spoiled by my Acer's slick sharp screen. The screen is also smallish--although the diagonal measure is true, the depth of the screen is less than my other computers.The model ships with BootCamp, which works great, although you will have to purchase Windows VISTA separately if you're going that way. I have partitioned my hard drive 50/50 Mac/PC and am experiencing no problems. I use the machine as a PC except for iPod and photos. Apple also provided decent in-computer speakers, thank heavens, so you can play videos without using supplementary speakers.The keyboard is backlit in low light settings (you can turn this feature off). This is rather nice, but it doesn't make up for the touch of the keyboard, which doesn't feel all that great to me.Now is this machine were 1/2 the price, things would be different.

The hardware was excellent: solidly built case, nice backlit keyboard, good feel to the keyboard keys, and glass-like screen. However, I did not like the installed operating system: Mac OS 10.6. In summary, I did not find it as easy to use as Mac OS 9 or Windows XP. I found using the mouse especially annoying: Mice I have used moved a screen distance proportional to hand-distance moved, and did not depend on the velocity of the hand, but in Mac OS 10.6 the screen distance moved also depends on hand velocity. Also, compared to Mac OS 9, I did not find the contents of the menus at the top of the start-up screen as well organized. Mac OS 9 had something like Windows XP's Start menu, both of which allowed one to navigate through OS settings and folders, but Mac OS 10.6 does not have this feature.","August 2, 2011",

I've run through every laptop during those years and I must say that with the MacBook Pro 17"" is amazing. The display is dazzling - clear and crisp enough to display HD images. The keyboard is actually a pleasure to use. The iPhone type tracking has immediately spoiled me. Even the speakers finally have enough volume. It's the best in breed.Why not 5 stars then? Apple stuff is made in China with all the usual crap about ""Well, we're different, we don't allow exploitation and brutality."" and are shocked, shocked to learn that the workers are exploited and brutalized. It is all so clean until someone (see MacWorld UK or the Mail) reports in from China about the conditions of the factories and the exploitation of the workers. I abhor the fact that Macs are made in a slave state. I think Apple should be made to advertise the fact more prominently in their hip adds: Perhaps have a 12-year-old undernourished Chinese girl to represent Macs just to let you know that this product is helping to perpetuate a brutal, genocidal regime. Maybe not so hip after all.So, great design. Terrible company. I still write Mac programs, but not with the same smugness that used to come with the marque. The Apple programmers are amazing, creative, et. al: the engineering is consistently innovative if not always good. Too bad all this talent works for Jobs and the rest of the unenlightened thugs running Apple.So, recommendation?

laptops,Dead Pixel Marring Otherwise Great Computer/Amazon Comes Through!,Blackout Ellie,R3E6BP2L5PN1AA,3,"***** - 5 Stars (UPDATED BELOW)'Nuff said about how great this computer and Leopard are.HOWEVER, out of the box I have one DEAD PIXEL just off center which shows as a black dot the size of a small period. According to Amazon and Apple, one dead pixel is not enough to warrant replacement of a brand new computer. I know it's one tiny pixel out of a million but once you notice it you always seem to see it. It just seems to me that for $1300 you should be able to receive a computer without screen imperfections. I wouldn't care about discoloration or scratches on the case but the screen should be perfect. I don't buy Amazon's & Apple's excuse that this is acceptable: no Mac I've ever owned had dead pixels; none of my friends' Macs have dead pixels; none I've seen in Apple stores have dead pixels etc. Had I purchased in an Apple store I could have walked in within 30 days and they would have swapped it out. How can everyone I know and even my giant LCD TV not have any dead pixels but my brand new macbook has a permanent dot? On-line buyers beware.(END OF ORIGINAL REVIEW)UPDATE: AMAZON HAS COME THROUGH WITH FLYING COLORS AND SENT ME A BRAND NEW MACBOOK WITH NO DEAD PIXELS AT NO CHARGE. After a visit to the Apple Store (to confirm that if purchased there, they would replace it) I gave Amazon one more chance. Using the call-back feature, customer service instantly called me and without any hassle, told me that they would replace my defective Macbook. Sure enough, 1 day later my new Macbook arrived via FedEx and after staring intently at each and every pixel, I am completely satisfied. This is the kind of customer service I would expect, and makes me very happy to use and recommend Amazon in the future.A few things I've learned in this process. If you're worried about pixel issues, as soon as you get your new computer, download a Pixel Checker program or change your background to Red, Green, Blue, White, Black (separately) and check for any stuck or dead pixels. If there is a problem and you can live with it - enjoy your new computer, otherwise contact your dealer ASAP. Also, I had much better results dealing with the telephone support people as opposed to trying to resolve this by email. As long as Amazon takes care of its customers like this, I will be a lifelong user.I wish I could change the star ratings to 5-star but you're not allowed to edit that. This is really a great computer. Super fast and perfect for my needs. Weighs 5 lbs which is fine with me - not ultralight like the Airbook, but it seems lightweight enough to me. Leopard is a great OS and the bundled programs are fun and easy to use.","May 8, 2008",

The 15.4"" are way too bulky, the 13"" is just right - lightweight and portableThe neutral:(1) The brightness adjustment of the screen is too responsive - if you're sitting with your back to a lightsource, every time the book moves or your body moves will change screen brightness noticeably.(2) Don't like that I can't move the screen all the way back into the horizontal. Depending on how I sit, that's a very natural way for my to type.(3) I can sort of live without firewire. It's lame and I'll need to sell some of my hardware, but I can deal.The bad:(1) The screen. I could live with the glossiness, but the viewing angle is bad. A much larger/higher resolution screen would have fit the form factor if not for the insanely large bezel around it.(2) Battery life: with my factory new macbook, I get about 2h at best. Compare to the advertised 5h.(3) Lack of a card reader of standard video ports. This is a huge deal if you bought the book for it's small form factor, because now you'll have to carry around lots of accessories all the time. How the Hardware Designers justify not adding $10 in everyday use parts to a 1300 USD machine is beyond me. Ouch.(4) UPDATE: Recurring hangs when resuming from sleep. About one in every 30 times I close the lid, the macbook will either show a black screen or a spinning beachball upon reopening, with no recourse except a hard reset. Very disappointing :( I guess the lesson here is the old ""never buy a v1 product from Apple"" adage.Overall, nice enough not to return, but not worth the money I paid for it.

laptops,"Sleek appearance, but has room for improvement; loss of some basic features",Tristan C.,R3TX7NFJGWZVDO,3,"For my review I am going to organize this into positive and negative aspects of this new model based on my experience with both the old and new models, as well as a general understanding of what is available at this price point from PC manufactures (Dell, Sony, HP):Pros:1. LED screen, brighter, better battery life, better for the environment (no mercury).2. 1066MHz frontside bus.3. ~8x Better graphics performance than previous model.4. Easy access to hard drive.5. Half-pound lighter than previous model.Cons:1. No Firewire port. This means no target disk mode, or using minidv decks/cameras which require firewire. I feel this is a poor decision on Apple's part. This makes two of my hard drives useless without an adapter of some kind. One FW800 port would have been nice, and from an engineering point of view, they could have fit it in there.3. No HDMI port (yet to see this on a mac).4. No eSATA port (yet to see this on a mac).5. 5400 rpm hard drive. Better HDD performance requires $700 SSD upgrade on Apple's site. 7200rpm drive is something a tech savvy user can install themselves, though.6. Price. Base model is $1299.7. $1299 model does not have backlit keyboard. $800 Dell laptops have this.8. Display appears to have poorer contrast and viewing angles than previous model, even when using a Spyder calibration device. Also display is only available in glossy which some consumers do not like.Other points consumers should be aware of:1. Aluminum body; better displacement of heat than previous model, but body may dent easier.2. Button-less trackpad, people will have to retrain their muscle memory, but is rather easy to get used to.3. Display port replaces mini DVI port, but at least they have new adapters to DVI and VGA.Overall: I am generally neutral on this redesign. Very pleased with graphics upgrade, but equally disappointed by lack of ports, poor LCD display, and glossy only option. Bottom line, I can get a Dell Latitude for $800 with eSATA and Firewire--but, of course, it can't run Mac OSX.","October 27, 2008",

laptops,"Strong, but...",E. Beyrouty,RAKY7FWT2JGYV,3,"I'm the lifelong PC user that decided to give Macs a try after great iPod, iPhone experiences. I needed a new computer, the new macbooks just came out and had good reviews, so...great. I decided to give it a shot because I knew if I ran into trouble I could always run Windows.At first, I went all Mac. I bought the Mac version of Office and Quicken (the two client programs I actually use) and quickly saw that they are awful. The online reviews warned me but they truly are bad. Functional but nowhere near the PC counterparts. I couldn't port my Quicken history, which has more of my time invested than many would consider normal. That's why I purchased Vista. At first I installed it in bootcamp. Easy process but once I got the drivers installed I saw that it wasn't a clean port. The glass ""buttonless"" trackpad functionality wasn't mapped properly. The highlight-drag-n-drop was goofy, the right click functionality was spotty, the scroll speed was jumpy. It was all there but it was driving me nuts.I'm sure Apple will eventually fix the drivers (if they make it possible to install Vista, they should get the kinks out of their drivers), but this is why I decided to wipe it clean and install Vista inside VM Fusion (virtualization software). Very easy, great functionality (trackpad now works like it should) and having everything inside one desktop is great. This setup makes the entire system a little slower (still workable) but it defeats the purpose of the hardware and price points.I was able to install the new versions of Quicken and Office (both great) and finally have the functionality I want. After all was said and done (apple tax, 2 versions of quicken, 2 versions of Office, Vista license, Virtualization software), I'm sure I doubled my cost compared to a decent Windows based laptop. It's a sunk cost for me but hopefully this helps others. If you are hardcore Quicken / Office users, stay with the PC. Vista is fine. If you can stay in the Mac OS entirely, this is a great product. The rating would have been higher if Macs had decent 3rd party software ports or if Apple would have provided decent Bootcamp drivers for their new hardware.","December 14, 2008",
laptops,Beautiful but functionally disappointing,"Guido Weppler ""gjw50""",R3FRMU1AJ1AG4I,3,"I just bought my first Apple, a Macbook Pro (13""). Nice piece of artwork. But I'm shocked by the catastrophic font display and apparent lack of adjustment options (yes, seen the font smoothing option but the result's a joke with or without). I've read many posts on how apple's rendering is different from Windows, how exactly they manage to put so much thought into creating such a poor result, and how people prefer one or the other. But this seems just plain wrong -- I can't believe that there's so many people out there who, out of pure love for original font geometry (or for love of Apple), are willing to sacrifice readability/usability.There's some other disappointing surprises for someone who switches from Windows:- no easy window maximise/minimise, maximisation only via green button that maximises to the layout Apple considers best (I'd often prefer a different window size, mostly full screen, particularly on 13""). That means you end up using the mouse & moving/changing windows all the time.- very inefficient handling of screen real estate. Lots of permanently displayed info / top menu rows etc that you really don't need most of the time and that cut down usable screen area. Maybe I just haven't found it yet, but I don't see an easy way to switch to full screen.- sharp front edge on the unibody... that's very uncomfortable after a short while. Somewhere else I read that for Apple, clearly function follows form. That strikes me as spot on now...- Yes, you can soft-double-tap the large mouse pad, but if you decide to mechanically click it (you can do that anywhere on the pad), the sound of the mechanics is annoyingly loud.Bottom line: I feel mislead by a good amount of (unjustified) enthusiasm of the Apple fans around me. Next time I need to satisfy an esthetic urge, I'll go and buy a new watch instead. Going Apple doesn't seem to be the right reaction if you're unhappy with Microsoft.","November 13, 2009",

laptops,Quick review,L. Abdulla,R2W3CVQ0H9IDXK,3,"I agree with most of the good and the bad reviews the others wrote and I am not going to repeat what they said. I just want to bring up a couple of points nobody seems to have mentioned. This computer has all the USB's on the Left and Right sides, plugging any USB cable will be in your way especially if you need a clear area for a mouse. you can't place any documents or books on either side because it will damage or bend the USB jack etc. Another thing that they don't mention except if you dig deep into HP's site, you can not use Windows XP as a second OS although they make it sound that dual boot is a piece of cake. You can only upgrade but not downgrade! You are stuck with Vista or W7.","June 2, 2009",
laptops,Mixed Feelings Over This HP Pavilion Laptop,Marissa,R3RQGSMKE9QXHO,3,"I have the 1245dx version of this laptop. The 17-inch screen is marvelous and the laptop's design and the chrome/bronze finish is sharp and makes it look so much more expensive than it actually is. It is not as portable as other laptops but is an acceptable trade-off to have a big screen. The keys are very comfortable and have a nice soft touch, the space bar is short and works well ergonomically, and the keyboard is laid out with number keys off to the right, which is useful. Both for work and for play [media applications], you feel like you have a mini flat screen TV on your desk.My review of this laptop is mixed however. This HP Pavilion refreshes slower than the Compaq Presarios my kids have. Also, when changing the appearance of the menu and other texts, there are some fonts that end up with less fidelity - parts of letters are faded! The worse is the white color of the letters/symbols on the keyboard. They are very hard to see against a bronze background. If you look at the keys from the right side at an angle, the letters and symbols are very visible. But who would crank their necks this far to type? When looking directly over the keys, more than half of the letters and symbols are nearly invisible! So much for fashion versus function.Other than these complaints, I would still recommend this laptop. Will I buy another one? Yes, but only if they do something about the colors on the keyboard.","April 21, 2009",

Yes, this laptop has sleek lines, and the color is cool. The graphics are sharp and the screen is large enough that you can enjoy the DVD player. Add on a subwoofer and you have yourself a nice machine. If that is what you are looking for then this is the laptop for you. BUT, after a long day, you have brought home work that needs to be in the next day, you want to retreat to your corner and complete it....this is NOT the machine for that job and all of the above sleekness means nothing to you. Like magic the keyboard basically disappears. I am sorry that I never took typing seriously; I have a new profound high level of respect along with envy for the touch key typist. Still out of frustration, you do not want to put out the money for this only to have a keyboard you can't see. I have even tried holding it at various angles to try and work with it. At a recent outing,my friends wanted to see the laptop with the disappearing key board, I was too ashame to even bring it out. In closing if ""entertainment"" is the name of the game, HP has clearly knocked the ball out of the park with this one.

laptops,"Have two: one is great, one is dying!",Cinnamon,RR6Q3W2QT9T2R,3,"Had I written this review, say a half-year ago, I would have undoubtedly given the Macbook 5 stars. I took it with me to college after my previous laptop - an Acer Aspire - failed me horribly. My Aspire had an issue with overheating, which only presented itself after my warranty expired. The cost of repairing it was not worth it when compared to getting a new laptop that was smaller, lighter, more powerful, and more capable of multi-tasking (more RAM).I come from a family that has been using Macs for over a decade, although I myself preferred Windows computers...up until Windows Vista came out. We had many Macs around the house growing up since my parents use Macs in their office, and I was never really impressed with the Apple Operating System, so I had doubts about the Macbook. But since the Macbook is loaded with 2GB RAM and an Intel processor, you can run BOTH Mac AND Windows operating systems with ease. I therefore figured worse comes to worst, I'll use my Macbook as a laptop to run Windows XP with. I used it very heavily in college and it served me very well. It's light weight allowed me to easily carry it from class to class, its included photo and video editing software gave me hours of productivity, and perhaps best of all, it was reliable! I really loved my Macbook and would like to give it 5 stars...but...My sister, who was in graduate school, also got a Macbook at the same time I got mine. Her laptop fared well, up until the end of last year. For some reason, the laptop started getting buggy...it'd freeze, it would overheat, it became a major nuisance. We've reformatted several times, hoping that would solve the problems, but to no avail. I HIGHLY recommend getting the AppleCare protection plan. We regrettably didn't, and really don't feel like forking over the money to repair the Macbook since she doesn't use it much anymore anyway. But our attempt to save money by not getting the protection plan will end up costing us more money now, should we choose to repair the laptop! The experience with our second, identical Macbook, is why I have to give 3 stars instead of 5 for an otherwise strong performance product, that can run both Windows and Mac, that comes bundled with a lot of great software, and that looks really cool (especially on a college campus where almost everyone has Macs!)A last note...I have more recently purchased the sleeker Macbook, and would like to emphasize that while its construction is nicer, and it doesn't look as cheap as this plastic one, I still think this is a good deal. If you're looking to ""wow"" people and can splurge, get the newer model, but if you are looking for a powerful laptop and don't care too much about having the latest build, this one is just fine. I still use my plastic one even though I have the newer (cooler-looking!) one.","August 2, 2009",

However, it IS still a Mac and, with a bit of a RAM upgrade, quite capable of handling the new OS X (which, in my opinion, is pretty sweet).

I had high expectations for this model and the actual product didn't meet them. Also, the firewire port is 800, not 400.

laptops,"Great laptop, but not for everybody","Juan Alvarez ""Latin American Road Warrior and...",R36OCN6YVXXR9G,3,"I was one of the first people to buy one of these and have been using it since the beginning of February. (Bought the VGN-P530H) This is my main computing device that I use 12-16 hours a day and I love it, but it is not for everybody.I travel a lot, nearly all of it internationally, and often in economy. This is a laptop that you can use on the smallest of tray tables, even with the seat in front of you fully reclined. I bought the leather pouch accessory and often carry the laptop around in it. It's great to just be able to walk by my desk, toss it in the pouch and go to a meeting and then pull it out if I need it. Since it is only about the size of a notepad, it's easy to carry around everywhere, to situations I wouldn't want the bother of a laptop bag.The laptop appears sturdily built for the rigors of road warrior travel. Since February, I've flown more than 50K miles with it, including a 2 week vacation in Japan where we visited 11 cities. It's taken its fair share of bumps and doesn't show it. I originally bought this for my wife but began using it as my own when my company provided Dell E4200 broke in its 3rd week (the monitor backlighting electronics burned out). While the monitor lid is not thicker than other models, it seems to be more resilient because of the smaller surface area.The Vaio P is visually attractive. When using it in the executive lounge in the airport or on a plane, people will often come up to ask what model it is. The screen quality is amazing, especially when you consider they packed 1600x768 pixels into that tiny screen. You'll need 20-20 vision or better to be able to comfortably read this screen, which will be a deal breaker for lot of people. If you're unsure, try one out in a store before buying. Setting the icons and text to a larger size can help. One of the things that I don't like about the laptop is that it does not have and lower resolutions that are in proportion. For example, the next lower resolutions are 1024x768 and 800x600 which appear distorted since they are out of proportion compared to the native resolution. There are times when I'm in a bumpy car or somewhere else with a lot of motion and use the 800x600, but it would be nice if they had something more proportional like 800x400 or 1024x500.Love the keyboard and the pointer stick (I can't stand track pads). The right shift key is unusually sized and placed, it drove me nuts for about 2 weeks until I got used to it.The power adaptor is small. There are no ports for Ethernet and VGA on the laptop, you need to plug in the included dongle for that. The dongle is fairly small and clips on to the power adaptor brick. The only thing I didn't like about the dongle is that it does not have little LEDs on the Ethernet port that show the status of the Ethernet connection. This is a useful features for travelers - to know more quickly if the port you plugged into is live or not.The laptop came with Verizon 3G, which has a nice prepaid option where you can buy service for $9.95 a day, without entering into a contract, which is nice compared to buying WiFi access in hotels, since you can use it anywhere you have coverage for the day. (I didn't find any coverage holes on my trips to southern California, Chicago, Northern Virginia, Baltimore and Miami) However, since most of my travel is outside the US, where the card does not seem to work, this is a mostly useless feature for me and it would have been nice to be able to trade it for something more useful like, GPS.A few things I didn't like:The main issue we had with the laptop was poor performance with Windows Vista. As installed, it is unacceptably slow for regular everyday use. We installed the beta of Windows 7 on the laptop and it is working fine. Installing Windows 7 on the laptop is a breeze, the only drivers I downloaded were for the video and the network. I have been running with this laptop as my main computer for the last few weeks (on Windows 7) and the performance is not an issue opening web pages, outlook, powerpoint, excel and word at the same time. Things will start to slow down with too many (e.g., 8 Firefox windows, outlook, 2 powerpoint presentations and 3 excel sheets) - closing a few windows will bring back the zippiness. We didn't get the SSD and I wouldn't bother. I keep a fast 32GB SDHC card in the SD bay to increase the storage size since 64GB can be a little limiting.The battery life is not great - with WiFi on, I get less than 2 hours battery life. A little more than 2 hours with the WiFi off. The power adaptor outputs a non-standard voltage: 10.5V, so you will not be able to use it with nearly any universal power supply or universal laptop batteries (like the ADC). Together with the low battery life, this is a serious problem on trips.A word to the wise, contrary to some misleading information on the Vaio website, this laptop does *not* come with GPS or any navigation software. I was very disappointed about this, as the website intro to this product implies they have it and the sales rep that sold me my laptop over the phone confirmed that the laptop definitely does come with GPS. To the best of my knowledge, none of the P-series laptops Sony is selling in North America come with GPS. We came very close to returning the laptop for this reason alone. Another thing to be wary about - the sales rep tried to sell me an Ethernet/VGA dongle when the laptop already comes with one.The WiFi card does not support 5GHz WiFi N - this is disappointing in a brand new premium laptop since this has been available on many laptops since the middle of last year. Also, the laptop does not have an easily found serial number on the bottom. This may sound nitpicky, but it's a problem for those of us that visit buildings that require registering the laptops with a serial number before entering and upon leaving.In summary, this may sound like a lot of things not to like for someone who loves the laptop, but I wanted to be complete as this laptop is not for everybody. I love the smaller size and that for such a small size it has such a nice keyboard, screen resolution and reasonable performance on Windows 7. More memory, a faster processer and a larger disk would be nice, but I can get by. The bigger problem is the battery life and I'll probably be getting an extended battery in the future to solve that. The Vaio P is also reasonably rugged - my last 2 laptops were a Dell E4200 and a Sony TZ-200 both of which developed screen problems and needed repair on my first or second trip with them (and neither suffered any significant abuse). I'd give it 4 stars, but am docking Sony 1 star for being misleading about the GPS.","April 21, 2009",
laptops,Horribly slow...real bummer,Red,R3G85BCKN1VUCP,3,"This is such a nicely made laptop. Awesome style, beautiful design..not a bad price considering Sony Vaio's past history. The text is going to be small and it's something you will have to deal with if you want the portability.You can increase the font size but I didn't like how it distorted some of the graphics. Keyboard is decent as well for the size. It does tend to run really hot so I doubt there is any cooling system in this tiny little package.The pointer mouse also takes some getting used to. My biggest gripe is how incredibly slow this thing is. I had the Vaio TX series before this one and it too was impossible to run on Vista. I agree this needs to be downgraded to XP. In my experience I have not had too many pc's that ran well on Vista anyway. As a matter of fact I just installed Windows 7 Ultimate on an Acer Aspire One and that seems to work better than Vista as well. I might try that first before I switch this to XP. I may end up returning this if it continues to be slow. My $300 Acer runs so much better out of the box than this one. Also, like the TX series I purchased before this, it comes with so much crap on it that it takes up 20gb+ of the 60gb hard drive.","February 17, 2009",
laptops,The return of the Picturebook,"digitalman ""digitalman""",RZQUPB9U9HTJ9,3,"About 10 years ago, Sony created the picturebook, which was basically the same concept and form factor as the lifestyle PC. With this ""new"" entry into the ultra portable market, Sony is trying to rejuvenate a very mobile product.I wanted to love this laptop (Sony doesn't want you to call it a netbook - probably so you don't feel bad about the cost - a $900 netbook is steep). I always wanted a picturebook. Something that you could easily carry around for basic stuff. Bring on a plane and watch a few HD videos. Surf the internet, email, etc. It really seemed to be the perfect device. Plus the built in GPS was something that I was very excited about. So much so that I was willing to overlook the $900 price tag. On paper, this seemed to be a very nice and capable computer in a very small - and beautifully designed package.But when I got it, I saw some of the flaws... serious flaws. There are basically three major flaws. The first is Vista. It just wants to much power for this little computer to really shine. A device like this needs a very lean operating system. The only thing that is lean about Vista on the Sony P, is that you have to shut off all of the eye candy so it will be usable. This was strike one.I tried running XP and Windows 7, and while they both ran significantly better, there was still another flaw - the Video card. Unfortunitly, it seems to either be a driver issue or a less then adequate video chipset. What ever it is, know this - this laptop does not play video very well at all. In fact you have to jump through a few hoops just to get it to play videos without them stuttering. It is really sad. In my opinion, someone, or some department should have gotten fired for this.It never should have been realased unitl playing video worked flawlessly (both regular and HD). This should have been a no brainer for Sony - the media giant. I mean the display on this laptop is begging to be a portable video player. Strike two.The finally, the bloated applications that come preinstalled. A HUGE flaw. There is an application (smartwi) that manages the wireless network card, bluetooth, GPS and the mobile broadband connection. This is the one of the biggest drains on the laptop's resources. There are so many required apps, that even if you do a clean install of XP or Win7 - you have to install a whole bunch of Sony bloat, many of which only run in Vista. Really, between Vista and the Sony bloatware, this should be nimble little computer is brought to its knees in tears. Strike threePersonally I never had a really great experience running XP, Vista or 7 on this... and I tried. Boy did I try. I spent many hours trying and reading forums and trying again. As I said earlier, I WANTED to love this laptop - I WANTED to get it to work. But in the end there were so many big and little things that just didn't work that I sent it back.It really is a shame. If Sony can get their act together, this would be a great portable device. Unfortunately, based on how I have perceived Sony to do business, they won't. What they will do is release a new model of this device every 3-4 month and each one will be very minor changes for the same amount (if not more) money. Meanwhile, someone else (like Fujitsu or Apple) will come in behind Sony and do it right.For now, I am going to save my $900 until I can find one that has all the kinks worked out.","April 4, 2009",
laptops,Great for a very narrow use,A. Lawyer,R1YP2B6DZA0S5N,3,"The reason to buy this is to have a PC wherever you go. It is the only PC I've seen small enough to carry anywhere, but still be functional. That's where it's great and worth $900 for those willing and able to spend so much. On the other hand, it is too small to serve as my primary laptop. I bought an Asus eeePC when it first came out. The keyboard is narrower than the Sony, and I could never get used to it. While it is very small, the Sony is much shorter and thinner and easier to carry, and the AC adapter is tiny. Like other Sony laptops, and unlike most Windows laptops, the screen is very bright. The smallness of the fonts is not a problem in browsing and most programs because the font size can be adjusted easily enough without any major tradeoff. Other programs, like Outlook, and working within Windows are much more eye challenging. I've owned four or so Sony laptops over the years and always liked their size, aesthetics, and screens, but they are Windows machines and don't begin to compare with the MacBook Air, which is by far the best laptop I've ever had (which goes back over 20 years). If and when Apple has a product comparable to the Sony Vaio P, I'll likely be one of the first purchasers.","April 12, 2009",

They run XP. Microsoft doesn't even support that anymore. They were reasonably solid machines at the time, but these things have been kicking around for a loooonnngg time.If your budget is 150 or less, I suppose you could do worse but I'd focus on finding a cheap desktop instead.

laptops,Keep your Windows machine,Tugsan Topcuoglu,R1DLXA0X0R9KDN,3,"I purchased my MacBook Pro about a year ago. I also have another laptop which has Windows and Linux installed on it. I am not an Apple fan, and this is the first and only Apple product I have purchased.The reason I got this machine was the Garageband application. I'm an amateur musician and I wanted to record my band practices, as well as to compose new songs. In that respect, it served the purpose. I'm very pleased with the Garageband application.However, be warned: It takes a while to get used to the Mac OS. It's very different than Windows. Second, do not get rid of your Windows machine. You will need it!This is not a product that once you take it out of the box, everything will work. For instance, I'm from Europe, but MacBook does not play the DVDs from other regions of our global world, something even the cheapest $20 Chinese DVD players can do! (To be more precise, you need to select a region and stick to it). It also keeps giving errors when I try to play any copied DVD. (Just google the words ""mac"" and ""dvd region"" and you'll see a flood of complaints and frustrations) Also, most of my external hard drives do not work with MacBook.In addition, when you connect a camera or handycam to Macbook, it automatically saves those files to a very weird, almost hidden, location. In order for the Apple applications, such as iTunes, iPhoto, etc. to read those files, they have to be at a specific location, which is really annoying. You cannot choose where to put your photos!I find Apple much more controlling than Windows. Its operating system wants you to do things the way they want. Of course, it's more stable, faster, and less vulnerable to viruses, but all that comes with a cost. (The latest version of Windows is also very fast, so I'm not sure if there's a significant difference between Mac and Windows anymore in terms of speed)Overall, do not expect too much. Like all the other Apple products, it looks pretty but it has a lot of limitations. Keep your Windows (or Linux) machine nearby. You may also need to purchase an external DVD player and a new external storage disk. MacBook is pretty but far from being perfect.","August 3, 2010",
laptops,Apple's quality is going downhill,Jonathan Birge,R1NXE2XHHNTMPL,3,"Without a doubt, the *design* of this laptop is fantastic. I love the solid machined aluminum frame, and the keyboard is the best of any laptop I've used. Unfortunately, Apple's quality has continued to slide. Despite the claims of the Apple apologists (a vice of which I am recently myself reformed) the internals of Mac laptops are NO different from PCs' at this point. It's now all commodity hardware. And that probably explains why I've already had my SATA controller go bad within a year of buying it. (The SATA controller is the motherboard chip that lets the CPU talk to the hard drive.) Looking online, many people are having the same problem. (If you ever see the spinning beachball come up when you think it shouldn't, check the ""Activity Monitor"" app to see if the disk throughput has temporarily dropped to zero. If so, you may be having similar problems.)My friend just had to replace his entire motherboard, so did my wife, and it looks like I will have to as well. While Apple's saving grace is the fact that they at least stand behind their products, and their support is great, it would be nice if their products were more reliable to justify the premium.","December 5, 2009",
laptops,Beautiful yet not flawless,aozorap,R3OV0NNVQQRV0O,3,"I bought the 15.4"" mac after having gone through 3 PC in less than 5 years. Needless to say, I was fraustrated with each PC after a couple of years, it either dies on me or some apps fails to work properly because the forced upgrade that Windows kept pushing into the PC is not compatible with the apps. After my last Sony VAIO desktop died on me first with the blu-ray disc drive, and then the apps began to fail, I turned to Mac hoping this kind of problem will no longer happen and the macbook pro will last me years to come. I was debating between 15"" and 17"" because I like the bigger screen size (my Vaio desktop was 21"") and the ease to carry around. After visiting the apple store I decided 15"" is the perfect size and with Amazon.com's competitive pricing and fast delivery, I got it in two days. I'm impressed with the design of Macbook pro and how fast it is to start up and shut down. The resolution is amazing, particularly with iphoto, you can see every detail of the picture. I have yet to explore other apps other than itunes. The advertised battary life was 7 hours, I haven't fully tested that yet, although I noticed that the battery generally start at about 5-6 hours after a full charge. I would have given this product a five stars review if it wasn't for the mac freezes. For example, I was importing a CD into itunes, but after importing only 2 songs, the whole screen suddenly froze and I could not force quit the app or move the cursor. I had to hold the power botton for 8 sec to force the mac to shut down. Fortunately, there was no issue when I re-started the mac. However, for a product that is highly priced, this should not happen.","December 21, 2009",
laptops,CLOSE TO GREAT....IF YOU CAN STAND THE PAIN!,Amazon Customer,R2GJG8RHSFTJCP,3,"After 25 years with Microsoft, I threw in the towel. This Mac seemed to be all that I was looking for: Ability to run Windows, good battery life, light weight, less virus prone. And, I have to say that it pretty much delivered on all counts except one. Apple's unibody looks great, but if you use your machine on your lap be prepared for a world of pain. The leading edge of the of the machine is razor sharp. Within a few minutes, depending on how you rest your wrist or palm on that edge, you will have to keep repositioning your hands to snuff the pain. After my first few hours of using my Mac, my wrists and palms were raw. Now please don't tell me about all the aftermarket fixes. Yes, I already tried a couple and they somewhat mask the sharp edge. But for a laptop that costs $2k, I should not have to stick on do-dads to avoid discomfort. What was Apple thinking?Wondering if I was the only one that was bothered by this issue, I decided to Google the problem. Well, apparently from the hundreds of comments I read, this issue is widespread among MacBook Pro users (especially the unibody model). One Mac owner actually took sandpaper to his new machine to file away the edge!Apparently, for those who use the Mac at their desk, it's not much of an issue. But is you use this laptop as a laptop (silly me!), I suggest you wrap your wrists and palms with an Ace bandage.Before I go....Apple tech support: In a word, poor. I had a problem getting the Mac to talk to my other 2 Windows Vista computers. I was told that this was easy and that the Mac would have no problem doing so. Well, I had no luck. Apple tech support was pleasant but in the end told me to call Microsoft (the arch enemy that I though I had fled!). Apple said all my Mac settings were correct. Fortunately, I happen to have purchased ""Switching to a Mac"" from Amazon. Knowing nothing about an Apple or my MacBook Pro, I opened the book and had my Mac talking to my Vista machines in 5 minutes. My Apple tech had skipped over an entire window of settings. So much for Mac technical support. A real disappoint and close to inexcusable.","August 7, 2009",

laptops,MB OK,KSBAY,R11EHA3Y55KDUM,3,"The white Macbook was updated on May 18 2010. There are minor differences between the 2010 Macbook and 2009's model, detailed below.The UPGRADES are1) Geforce Nvidia 320M integrated graphics processor with 48 processing cores. This is better than the Geforce 9400M in last years model. Useful for content creation.2)Mini display port now supports video AND audio with a compatible Mini-DP to HDMI adapter. (Last years model only supported video)Thats it.STANDARD FEATURES - from last years model (minor changes noted in brackets)Polycarbonate unibodyCore 2 Duo processor (2.4ghz - up from 2.26 ghz)1280 x 800 resolution Glossy LED backlit screen,iSight camera,2 GB Ram - 1gb ram sticks x 2250gb hard drive8x slot-loading SuperDrive dvd burnerLarge multi-touch trackpad ( Intertial scrolling is now enabled ),2 USB 2.0 ports ,Wi-Fi - 802.11n specification; 802.11a/b/g compatible, Bluetooth 2.1 and Gigabit Ethernet -10/100/1000.Inbuilt battery - (which Apple advertises as capable of lasting between 9 to 10 hours.) Not true. Real world battery life is between 3 to 6 hours depending on what tasks you use your computer for.Software included is OS X 10.6 Snow Leopard and the iLife 09 suite of content creation tools. A 1 year warranty on parts and 90 day telephone technical support is standard.The Macbook as it is - is good for basic computing activities - such as browsing the web, typing articles or watching movies. However, if you're planning to buy a Macbook for multimedia work, such as editing high resolution photos or HD videos and plan to use multiple applications at the same time, please ensure that you upgrade the ram from 2gb to 4gb.Why?Because using a macbook with 2 gb of ram (such as this one) to multitask is a GREAT way to drive yourself crazy as the computer struggles to keep up. Try editing 10 megapixel RAW images while playing music in iTunes with Safari open. 2gb of ram is not at all adequate for multitasking / using processor intensive applications on a Macbook. I understand that Apple has to differentiate between the Macbook and MBPro to justify the price differences but skimping on the ram and putting 2gb inside a $999 product and thus, affecting the user experience is not the way to do it.Upgrading the ram yourself from 2gb to 4gb is a great idea. Currently, Crucial CT2KIT25664BC1067 4GB 204-PIN PC3-8500 SODIMM DDR3 Memory KIT (2GBx2) costs $39.99. So that brings your total to $1010 ($969 MB + $39.99 Ram) if you upgrade your Macbook's ramSo for only $160 more than your Macbook, (if you take into account the cost of the ram upgrade) a viable alternative is the standard Apple MacBook Pro MC700LL/A 13.3-Inch Laptop which costs approximately $1160 on Amazon. The MBP 13 comes with the added benefits of a more durable aluminum unibody, a backlit keyboard, an SDXC card slot, a firewire 800 port, a thunderbolt port and most importantly, 4gb of ram. Which allows you to multitask effortlessly.If you're going to use the Macbook for any computationally demanding activities such as content creation, editing large RAW images or HD videos you should upgrade the ram to 4gb or just buy the standard MBPro 13 inch. The significantly faster i5 processor and 4gb ram in the MBPro 13 make a big difference in the daily usage experience.However, if you only want to use the Macbook for general tasks like writing articles, browsing websites or watching movies, it will handle those duties adequately. At the same time, also keep in mind that if you only need a laptop for basic duties, many other manufacturers offer less expensive laptops which are just as (if not more) capable.Hope this helps!P.S. Update - Feb 15 2011 - At present, the Macbook is extremely out of date compared to other computer makers current products. C2D processor, 250 GB 5400 rpm hard drive, 2 gb ram, 2 USB ports. In 2011, these are totally unlike a $999 notebook's specs and more like a netbook's specs (excluding the C2D processor)I'd recommend waiting for a Macbook update by Apple. Another good option would be to buy a notebook by HP,Sony or Toshiba (for $999 you'll get a much more powerful machine with regards to hardware) or buy the updated 2011 Macbook Pro 13 base model.","May 24, 2010",
laptops,"A decent machine, but some usability flaws",PC Guy,RPE80CKJC9YDB,3,"This machine looks decent, and it is, but it's not great. It would've been nice if Apple used the same alluminum design that they did on all their other machines - this costs as much as the base MBA. Sure that one is a bit closer to a netbook, but both are still c2d machines.I would've thought that 2GB RAM is too little, but with OS X it's not actually too bad - I guess it's a bit lighter than Windows. It still would've been nice if they upgraded the CPU to one of the newer i series ones, like the i3. Still, this one satisfies. And it does have nvidia graphics. I can't tell whether the 250GB HD is 5400RPM or 7200RPM, but it's fast enough.Why would Apple keep using a 16:10 screen when they are all 16:9? Aren't macs supposedly good for multimedia? The desktop ones use 16:9 (imacs). There's not much difference, except that there are annoying black bars with 16:10 when you watch movies.The keyboard is OK, but the laptop has an annoying somewhat glossy finish, which I really hate (I didn't realize it had that when I bought it). Also, when you see it in person, the white really looks worse than it does in pictures - it gives a cheap look. Black would've been better. Also, the screen has lots of glare - when I am in a room with a moderate amount of lighting I can see reflections no matter what way I turn the screen. That's definitely not good. At this price, a matte screen would've been nice.The build quality is ok, certainly better than that of a $400 Windows laptop, but in this price range and with its' specs I'd expect better.Unfortunately, the battery is not removable - I wish I'd known that when I bought it.Also, although the touchpad is quite responsive with multitouch gestures, due to its' size, I keep bumping it when I type. I changed the settings, but the issue persists. On another laptop I have, due to the smaller touchpad, this not an issue (and that's an 11.6"", so things are more crammed). On the other hand, that one has a pointing stick, so I don't need the touchpad at all. Not that I'd expect Apple to do that. It's too bad that the pointing curve is tuned towards touchpads, which makes it really hard to use an external mouse on this. I'd really like to do that and disable the touchpad to avoid the issues, but that pointing curve makes it next to impossible to use.Additionally, I didn't know, from amazon's description, that the video output is a Mini-Displayport, which absolutely no one else uses. That's just annoying. Why can't they just use a VGA port and HDMI port like everyone else? Particularly HDMI - the connector isn't that big.Basically, this is a step up from a basic windows laptop, with some of the same flaws (and some others), and a much higher price tag. I was hoping that they could at least have a matte body and such. At this price range, the expectations change. I'm looking elsewhere.","May 30, 2011",

The package came with the computer, a manual, a CD with the software incase you have to restore original settings, keyboard filter screen (not sure the technical term for that layer), and a charger.I bought this computer because I was sick of PC's and I needed something new to try. The price was reasonable compared to paying one thousand for a new computer. I'm a college student so I could use all the money I can save.

laptops,Display too glossy,M. Floyd,R277820YF09ZJE,3,"Update 11/14: I've decided that I'm going to return this laptop. The glossy display is too reflective. It's not really that noticeable if you are looking at a web page with a white background with the brightness turned all the way up, but in almost every case it's just too glossy for my tastes. Also, as mentioned blow, this display fails horribly for sharing the screen for something such as watching a movie. If they swapped out the display and trackpad, this would be the perfect budget laptop.---I was torn between this product and the Acer Aspire Timeline. I ultimately decided to go with this product because of the battery life claim. Obviously the battery life claim on ANY laptop is quoted using settings that will not be reflective of the typical user.One of my biggest concerns with this laptop was the processor. I was not sure if it would be able to handle my daily computing activities. This machine is by no means a powerhouse, but it is more than capable. As long as you do not need to do anything such as gaming or multimedia editing, you should be fine with this laptop. This machine is capable of playing HD videos with a little extra left over for background tasks.Notes:- While you do receive recovery DVDs, if you need to take advantage of them you will need to get an external DVD drive. I have heard some reports that some external DVD drives do not receive enough power through one USB port and require either a powered USB hub or plugging the drive into two USB ports. (This is why USB cables for portable HDD and portable disc drives have two heads.) I am pleased to say that the Samsung USB 2.0 8x DVD Writer External Optical Drive for Mac and PC SE-S084C/RSBN (Gloss Black) works perfectly with just one USB plug.- The power brick can get hot. One review claimed it got as hot as 130 F. I have not personally experienced temperatures this extreme.Usage: Microsoft Office, Web Browsing, Media PlayerPros:- Great balance between speed and battery life.- The keyboard is fantastic.- Very lightweight and portable.- The laptop does not get so warm that it is uncomfortable in your lap.- The laptop has a very sleek look.- Excellent value for the price. Even on top of the specs, they throw in one year of accidental damage protection. That's an incredible value.- The fans are very quiet even when they are on.- Comes with little bloatware.- Ability to play HD movies with no tweaking whatsoever (using VLC). Keep in mind that Adobe Flash will soon be releasing an update that will push HD decoding off to the GPU. If the new 1080p at YouTube is choppy for you now, just wait for the new version to come out.Cons:- The screen is very glossy and reflective.- I've really discovered that the viewing angles aren't all that great if you want more than one person to look at your screen at one time for something such as watching a movie together.- The track-pad is less than ideal. The track-pad tends to move the cursor position while you are typing. The gestures are nice, but I found that the scrolling doesn't register. The trackpad utility is greatly lacking in features.- The hard disk squeaks. It's not terribly loud, but you will notice if you have no other background noise.- The chassis is indeed a fingerprint magnet. Again, this seems to be an issue with every make and every model laptop these days.- No back-lit keyboard. This is not necessarily a bad thing since a back-lit keyboard would drain on the battery.","November 11, 2009",
laptops,Battery life is not as rated...,"Danny H. Kwon ""dkwon""",R1TLKZ67XGNIUV,3,"Buyer beware. If you're considering this laptop because 10 hr+ battery life is a priority for you, look again. This laptop does not have anywhere near the 12 hours battery life as advertised. The most i've seen the battery life icon give it in Windows is 8 hrs (for just a few seconds before it dropped to 6) but in reality, real life time is more like 4-5 hrs of continuous use (word processing, internet surfing, emails). Decent battery life but not near the 8-10 hrs reviewers have been giving. Why the discrepancy? Here's what I've determined. The UL30A-X5 comes with an 8 cell battery but rated at 4800 mah (65wh). Just looking on ebay, there are 8 cell batteries rated at 5600 mah (85wh) or more for the UL30A which would give it better life. Plus, you can get 12 cell 7800mah (112wh) batteries which I presume would give you perhaps more than the 12 hrs as advertised for about $70 on ebay. But this laptop doesn't come with it either one of those longer life batteries. So long story short, I'm guessing that ASUS has swapped out the battery which gave the UL30A 12 hr battery life with a smaller capacity one that gives you good battery life, but not the 12 hrs as advertised. Nowhere on the laptop itself (you know how they advertise features using stickers) or packaging does ASUS advertise 12 hr battery life for this model. Just in the Amazon product description, the customer reviews, and in older laptop reviews can you find mention of the 12 hr battery life. Very misleading.Otherwise, the keyboard is good for typing. Screen is nice but overall, the computer is too glossy for my liking. Looks cheap. Speed is great for playing even 1080p video streams. Blu-ray compatibility test (cyberlink BD and 3D advisor) tells me this computer can play blu-ray no problem (just need to connect an external BD player). Wireless connection is fast with N connection. Speakers are good for a small laptop. Boot up time is 55 seconds from off to the Windows desktop. There is a nifty 8 second bootup feature which dumps you into DVD player, Internet and skype almost instantly. But the resolution is fuzzy so i don't know why you'd want to surf the web this way. Hard drive speed, while it's only 5400 rpm, is fast and quiet. In fact, this laptop is very quiet and stays fairly cool. And it is thin and very, very light.In conclusion, I was prepared to live with a glossy computer, slower cpu and smaller screen because of the long battery life. But now I'm stuck with a laptop that is an older core duo and I still don't have super long battery life. You can get a much more functional laptop (ie. DVD burner included and at least an i3 processor) which is only a bit heavier with similar battery life to this ASUS for the same price. But here's a thought. If I get an extra 12 cell battery off ebay for $70 and keep the current 8 cell for backup, I should be able to run almost 14-18 hrs continuously before I have to charge. Great for long transcontinental flights. Maybe I'll keep it.","March 2, 2011",
laptops,Average experience,Mike,R3N8YU6FUUCEX6,3,"Was totally hyped up and pre-ordered this notebook before it even came out. Unfortunately there were several drawbacks that made me ultimately return it.1. The keyboard key's kept jamming and making unnatural sounds.2. The deal breaker was here. My hard drive wouldn't stop making noises no matter what I did. It was very noticeable and loud compared to all my previous notebooks.3. Whenever I lifted up the notebook, it would suddenly start whining.4. The limited display view was also somewhat of a disappointment.Despite the faults, I was still fairly impressed with the notebook and had asked for a replacement.Unfortunately, the replacement I received had a dead pixel right in the middle so I ended up asking for a complete refund.Great service from Amazon as usual, but buying from Asus again is very iffy for me.","December 18, 2009",

laptops,"Flimsy, Easily Scratched, Clicky HDD, 8-hour Battery, Thin, Light",T. Gutmann,RTJQGX5HTBT9I,3,"Basically it's a good PC. It is replacing my more capable, but heavier Dell 1505 (Core2, 3gb, 1440x900 15"" LCD).Pros: Thin, light, ~6-8 hours of real-time battery depending on usage, 2 year warranty, 1 year accidental damage warranty, portableNote: The battery in this model is the smaller 10 hour+ 4400mah 8-cell, not the 12 hour+ 5600mah 8-cell found in the more $$$ UL30a's. Battery life is not the 12+ hour rating Amazon claims. Asus claims only 10+ hour on their website for this model.Cons: Battery life doesn't live up to Amazon's 12 hour claim, Asus bloatware slows Win7, creaky, cheap plastic construction (flexy palm rest), easily smudges (which transfers from palm rest to screen bezel), blue-ish screen, easily scruffed plastic (ironically, the cloth-like protector that comes as a separator between the screen and keyboard can scratch the screen bezel if used to wipe down the smudges), noisy possibly cheap HDD (I moved the computer once, slightly, while shutting down to hear the HDD clack and screech in protest).I'm normally not one to complain about cosmetics of a PC - heck, I have been lugging around a 6lb+ Inspiron 1505 for 3 years. But I'm astounded at how crummy this otherwise eye-catching Asus can look after a few smudges and now some scratches. I'm not abusive to my other electronics, so I don't like the way this computer is showing signs of what looks like heavy wear after just a few weeks use.Ok, so I sound down on this computer, but I'm not. I'm keeping it. It just didn't live up to the high praise and my subsequent expectations. I think the first thing I'll do is to put an SSD in it so I have no worries about the possibly bad HDD, or injuring the HDD.It'll be a good companion on the road for years to come, but just not a replacement for my Dell.","March 28, 2010",

laptops,Decent Laptop,S. Holmes,RUYER2H5VOFCK,3,"Let me start off by saying that I am a college student and bought this laptop for combination gaming and school work. My first year of college I used a desktop computer and then realized a laptop would benefit me more upon changing degrees. I have grown up around and am very familiar with computers.Pros: Typical Windows pros such as customization.Cons: I've had my about 2 1/2 years and the battery holds about 1 hour of charge (I just ordered a 9 cell replacement). This computer EASILY overheats. Sitting on my lap with one World of Warcraft window will eventually overheat it to the point of force shutdown. A good cooling board fixes this. Maybe it's just mine, but the eject key no longer works (manually telling it to eject still does work). Even with a 6-cell battery (what mine originally had) it's a bit on the heavy side.Physical cons: Power cord insertion cap broke (easily fixed with glue and electrical tape. Pads on the bottom of the computer come off easily if you slide the computer (if you find them, again easily fixed with glue).I haven't had experience with a huge range of laptops. I do recommend Dell. They have fair prices and good customer support, but I don't know that I would recommend this Dell model specifically for college. There are better laptop and netbook models out there for college bound consumers.","January 9, 2012",
laptops,Would be good if...,Myra Binnicker,R1BAVHWIMPXEKW,3,"There are a lot of nice features about this laptop. However, I feel I should address the biggest con first. It overheats like crazy. My daughter does virtual schooling, and it has thermal events in the middle of her work on a regular basis. I have tried cooling pads, and even stacking cooling pads, but it was little help. Without the cooling pad, it overheats when doing things as small as surfing the net. With cooling pads it is better, but still dies when doing something like Photoshop. The design doesn't help. The vent is in the rear of the laptop, and when you open the monitor, it covers the vent. It leaves nowhere for the heat to escape. Now for a basic breakdown:Pros:-We have the light up keyboard upgrade It is very quiet, and the lighting is soft, but nice.-The speakers are nice.-The chainlink design has a metal top instead of plastic. It feels nice and is easy to keep clean.-The graphics card does a nice job of keeping up (until the heat hits).-Media Player options built into the F keysCons:-The overheating issue...big one.-No number pad options-The keyboard occasionally goes out, and you have to go through this process to ""drain the flea power""","February 16, 2011",

laptops,"Great laptop, ok display",James,R30X06TVI5VT5V,3,"This is also my first review of a product. I was really looking forward to this laptop and when I received it and turned it on I was pretty disappointed. The display on this laptop is very poor. The contrast ratio is low, so everything looks a little washed out. Its not terrible and would be tolerable but the horizontal viewing angle is horrible! You have to get the angle perfect to make the display look acceptable. If you move it slightly towards or away from you, it looks discolored and is pretty much unusable. I have owned several laptops over the last couple years from a 13 dell xps to 18.4 inch hp hdx and I have never had a problem with or complained about a display before. I've never even considered examining a display because I'm not that picky, but that was the first thing (and only thing really) that stood out through all of my time using the laptop. The only reason I'm writing this review is to caution people about the display. If it is not that important to you than this is a great laptop. It's speedy, fairly well made, great battery life, relatively thin and light, and windows 7 rocks. If the display was better it would get 5 stars. If I had the choice to return this laptop for a full refund I would, only because of the display.NOTE: I also have asus eee pc 105ha and it has a much better display than this laptop for contrast and viewing angles.**UPDATE** I feel the need to clarify this because I have received a few comments with tips or information about this display. I have owned and used many laptops of all brands, price ranges, manufacturers etc... This is a BAD display, it's not just my subjective opinion.

So, I returned it and got a new replacement... with the same issue!! When I went to return this one, I was just going to ask for a refund-- but turns out that was my only option cus it said they were now 'out of stock'... which I think may mean they pulled them because there was an issue with all batteries in their current shipment. If that's the case, I never received any info from Amazon about it. So, I had to find a new laptop at a new location. Thankfully, Amazon has excellent returns policy so I was able to keep the laptop that the battery didn't work on until the new laptop came a week later.Besides the battery issue I had, it was a very nice laptop.

I considered getting a gaming notebook, but none of them have a decent battery and most have quite a few issues with heat and durability.I decided to go for the new Mac Pro after seeing the specs and hearing rave reviews of older models from friends. I'm so glad that I did! The one PC game I couldn't make it without(Starcraft II) works just fine on OSX as well as in Parallels.I am a web developer so I've heard from friends in the field about how nice the Mac software is compared to Windows equivalents. (I tried Coda and absolutely love it!) There are several programs that I've switched to that are as good if not better than the Windows counterparts.The construction of the MBP is outstanding. It feels incredibly sturdy and capable of lasting the tides of time.Overall, I'm extremely impressed. I've always felt that calling something expensive meant that you didn't agree that the value was worth the cost.If anything the Mac is undervalued based on what I've experienced![1st Edit]I've now had the Mac for a little over 2 months. I'm still as crazy about it as I was when I purchased it. If you are considering it and have the money, it's well worth it and hasn't had any kind of instability or hiccups![2nd Edit]I decided to sell the Mac and go back to Windows. This machine was too slow for me.","March 4, 2011",
laptops,"Designs = 5, Value = 2",JJ,R2F0JTKRDQ5BBM,3,"This thing is a beauty! It is BMW of laptops or Mercedes, Ferrari, whatever you want to call it. It's drop dead gorgeous. Let's use the car metaphor, unlike the exotic cars which have special engineered super power engine to justifies the high price. This Macbook pro's engine is similar to one found in not so exotic PC laptops such as Acer Aspire TimelineX AS3830T-6870 13.3-Inch Aluminum Laptop (Cobalt Blue), which cost $400 - $500 less. These days, computer components are very similar in performance and quality, because most of them are made by the same factories in China. The only differences is the case design and OS, is it worth the extra $500? That's for you to decide.This beauty feels very slow, because it uses a 5400 RPM hard drive instead of 7200 RPM drive, and I'm used to SSD speed on my PCs. Other than that, it's a laptop like all others. It's what you do with it that matters.","October 9, 2011",
laptops,Great Computer - Balky Touchpad,Hemant Dandekar,R3NK0AZ5NQUKA3,3,"I have had this laptop for close to six months now. The machine is everything it is advertised to be - fast, long battery life and great graphics and keyboard. Unfortunately, the touch pad is very balky. Often there is a lag between the multi-gesture functions (such a two finger up or down drag) and actual response on the screen. You have to have your fingers really clear of the touchpad to make sure you don't accidentally trigger the touchpad. I always use a small external mouse with this computer. It is ideal for my very long trips to Asia, where I can use the long battery life, get work done on the plane and still watch some videos all in a single charge. If it wasn't for the balky touch pad I would highly recommend this product.","November 20, 2010",
laptops,Finicky Wireless Card,J. Bowen,RIMV1KLGH09V,3,"The pros mentioned in all the other reviews are correct. Beautiful, lightweight machine, thoughtful design, etc. This thing seriously turns heads. I won't beat a dead horse, so to speak.However, out of the box I've had issues with the wireless card (Atheros AR9285) sporadically dropping my internet connection. This happens constantly with my home router and occasionally with others. I know it is not a router problem as my roommates do not have the same problem.I've updated the drivers to no avail. System restored for the heck of it, but as I said, I had this problem since my unboxing.Because the ability to connect to the internet is the most important feature of a laptop, an otherwise 5-star worthy machine gets a 3.If I ever get through to the Asus tech support hotline and have a satisfactory solution, I'll consider revising this review.Any solutions others can offer are welcome.","October 16, 2010",
laptops,"Good notebook with good battery life, but with some issues",Andrew,RSLTPC5B4OHYL,3,"I purchased this notebook as a present for my younger brother birthday. I used the notebook for some time to make sure that everything works, so my review will be kind of short and straight to the point.Design: Good. I can even call it stylish (once you remove all this annoying stickers that are all over it).Build quality: Ok. I did not expect it to be great, but I think it is good for the price I paid.Keyboard: Good.Touchpad: Did not like it. Weird to use because of it's textured surface.Display: GoodBattery life: Though it is not as advertised, but I think it is good. Maybe it is because I did not own CULV model before.This laptop is very quiet, except for one issue I had problems with. When the laptop is in idle its HDD starts making annoying clicking sounds. To me it looked as if it was issue with HDD power control. It sounds like the laptop spins HDD down for a moment to save power in idle, but the next second it starts spinning up and makes quiet but clearly audible clicking sound - ""shiick"". And it repeats itself every 20-30 seconds. If you start working on the laptop and put some load on HDD (like watching video) - the clicking sound goes away.Considering that other parts in this laptop are very quiet - this clicking sound is a little annoying. I went on the web and is seems that this HDD clicking sound is frequent issue with this model. I haven't heard similar sounds from HDD on any other notebooks I used so far.I run diagnostics but it did not show anything wrong with HDD drive. I called customer support and told them about what I am experiencing with their product. They told me that I need to send this new notebook to them (free of charge) so that they can take a look at the problem and if they find that HDD is defective they will replace it. After waiting for 2 weeks I got a call that they inspected my notebook and did not find any issues with HDD. I asked them about that 'clicking' sound, but the answer was that their technician inspected my laptop and it is operating as expected. No defects were found. I guess the technician was running the same diagnostics tool I was running.Overall: good laptop, but there is a chance of getting a laptop with clicking HDD, dealing with incompetent customer support which does not resolve your issues. If you get your laptop with quiet HDD (as quiet as the rest of this laptop parts) - you will be happy.","September 22, 2010",
laptops,Beware of warranty/customer service!!,John Warren,RKAFN6WC2MQJJ,3,"This is a nice laptop as stated by many, but it only deserves 3 stars for two reasons:1. The WD hard drive that it comes with has an annoying clicking sound. I have never noticed this sound on any other laptops I've used before, which worries me.2. Customer service at Asus... 1 star at most. I was on hold for no less than 45 minutes and was given misleading information and even ""threatened!!!"".If you are interested, the story:I called Asus to have my hard drive replaced because of the strange clicking sounds it made. The customer service rep advised me to use an ""advance replacement"" method to speed up the process. The advance method requires the owner to replace the hard drive themselves, and then send in the defective part. Sounds great right!?4 days later wondering where my replacement hard drive was I called Asus again. I was told this time that the ""return shipping is NOT covered!!"". I explained that the first customer rep mentioned that I would receive a shipping label via email but never received one. They not only refused to cover the return shipping, I was rudely asked ""read the advance replacement form"" again, and was threatened to be charged for the new hard drive if the defective part was not sent back.Sure I understand that they want to charge me for the part if I don't send it back, but the issue is I was never informed (included the form I signed) that shipping is only covered ONE WAY.So 2 year warranty... 1 year accidental damage... ""free two-way standard shipping""... SOUNDS GREAT right? But, not included unless you send the entire laptop to them. Which takes forever to get back.Just beware of that!Isn't it cheaper to send a hard drive than it is to send a laptop?!?!","July 13, 2010",
laptops,"adequate computer, poor touchpad",Norman Higginson,R3CMYYFX20Z3DV,3,"This computer works well except for the touchpad. It's some new system that tries to copy Apple but fails miserably. I have turned off most of the features so the touchpad will at least function. No two or three finger tapping, no two finger scrolling. The touchpad now functions but doesn't work well for games where you have to use it constantly. It's all right at first, then becomes unresponsive.Yes, I've contacted tech support. They got me to the driver download page and left me - but installing a new driver wasn't that easy and left me with the problems I've noted above. I didn't bother to call them back.I could use an external mouse but then why pay for an ultra-light, low energy using computer? So if you need a touchpad I suggest you look elsewhere.","August 19, 2010",
laptops,Disappointed,BookWoman,R30F1VFJCYPZ4U,3,"I read a lot of laptop reviews before deciding to purchase this computer. I was deciding between this and a much more expensive Lenovo model and decided to go for less money and more battery power.I've had the laptop for about a week and keep encountering problems. I'm disappointed - usually when something has reviews this great I tend to like it a lot. But I keep encountering glitches, and fresh out of the box! Here are some of the problems I've encountered:* Express Gate - this is a nice feature, you can boot up fast and use basic utilities. BUT, the screen resolution is set wrong, so the screen is stretched. I've searched user forums and there doesn't appear to be a solution that doesn't involve hacking into linux.* Express Gate skype - the microphone works fine when I access skype using the regular operating system, but it doesn't work in express gate. Again I searched user forums and found that no one seems to have a solid fix for this. How could the manufacturer ship these computers with skype installed in express gate but without the microphone working???? That makes skype useless! Apparently it works with a microphone plugged in (so I have read on the forums) but not with the built-in microphone.* Some documentation about how to utilize the power to get maximum battery life or performance would be nice. I haven't dug around the internet for this yet but will soon. When I first charged the computer and then unplugged it, it said less than 5 hours of battery. Fresh from the box! When it's advertised as 11-12! I had to search online to find out how to change settings to get it up to about 8.I've had a number of other glitches too just with things working... but the express gate stuff is a real disappointment.","May 4, 2010",

Sometimes the notebook just gives a loud nonstop buzz rather than say the program has been updated. This can be fixed by plugging in earphones, which will stop the buzz.Touch pad is not smooth.

laptops,Could've been the best,lightstream,RNZWPC3QXB9BO,3,"I've lived with this machine for just over a month so it's time to put my thoughts in a review.The performance of this machine has been eloquently described in most of the other reviews. I have nothing to add regarding the exceptional performance except one thing: my X3 does not get hot. I don't do gameing so I don't push the GPU/CPU to radical 3D extremes. I'm a graphic artist and photographer so I work with 2D graphics programs, often with extremely large files so I push the GPU and memory speed as well as CPU a lot farther than average use. Nothing I've done has caused a major heat issue. It does put out some hot air at the fan port and gets very warm on the bottom left corner but nothing like described in some of the other reviews. It never gets uncomfortable. Every high end machine I've used has gotten hot and this one is no worse than most. Heat is not an issue for me.The cons are mostly obvious things like bulk, weight, the power brick, the flimsy and silly looking lid with even sillier looking lights that can't be turned off. There are however a few unforgivable and inconceivable design flaws. Assuming this machine, though reasonably priced is seriously intended to be a high end powerhouse, it has some explaining to do.Inconceivable cons:There is no second hard drive connection. This is probably the largest form factor notebook on the market today. It has a second hard drive bay that is open, uncluttered and fits a hard drive with no problem, it just has no sata interface to plug the drive into. Thus, you can't use an SSD for a boot drive. You can't run a raid or have a backup drive, you can't have two 7200rpm 500G's for an otherwise unattainable terabyte at 7200 rpm.The USB ports are poorly positioned at the front of the machine but what's worse is they are so close together you cannot put two flash drives next to each other (!!!). I have about ten flash drives laying around so i tried every possible combination and I could not get ANY combo to fit next to each other. This is absolutely embarrassing for ASUS and infuriating for owners of these machines. How long have we known how wide flash drives are? SanDisk Micro Cruzer drives are way too fat, Corsair Voyager Mini 4GB drives can only be forced in at an angle next to a SanDisk Micro. How could they make such a mistake in 2010?A terrible flaw for me but apparently not for others is the lighted keyboard. This has to be one of the best features of this machine but it's rendered almost useless by the terrible design. The keys are clear plastic except for the very top part where the character is. The result is you have to look almost straight down over the keyboard to use it. If you sit back even a little from the keyboard the led lights under the keys become directly visible and blot out the keys completely. Even if you hover directly over the keyboard the light bleed around each key makes it extremely hard to use. Imagine a bright white light surrounding each key on your keyboard, like a frame, and thus having to really concentrate on each key to see what it says. It's nice to have in a dark room but it could easily have been made outstanding instead of downright irritating.Now the obvious cons:The size, weight, the overall bulk of this machine is excessive. If this is the only way to make a gaming computer then ASUS should offer one of the other slim long battery life machines with a high res screen. Some of them have almost identical specs but only come in the stupid 1024x768 Wide resolution. This machine is the only way to get high res and it's also designed specifically to appeal to gamers. Thus the flames on the lid and the ridiculous lights in the lid which can only be turned off by unplugging and running on the battery (the logo stays lit even when on battery). The bulk and the huge power brick seem to be part of the ""image"" of a gamer's machine.The lid feels cheap and alarmingly un-protective of the gorgeous screen. It flexes way too much and feels like even a light accidental tap against a table could shatter the lid and possibly the screen behind it. Think thin plastic, like on a model car, with the same motif of flames in a glossy paint job.Open the lid and the inside is beautiful. Everything is pure black, a matte rubberized covering over the entire palm rest and the same covering on the keys. The screen is incredibly nice and the 1920x1080 res is a wonderful amount of real estate to work with. Text is a mite small but easy to adjust up if you need it. The only glaring intrusion into the darkness of the interior is the (again stupid looking) bright brushed metal surround of the touch pad. It even has horns to make it look menacing for the targeted demographic of gamers.As stated in other reviews the plastic frame around the screen is way too large, almost like they wanted to use the same part for 15,16 and 17 inch screens. It's huge and clunky looking. Being a glossy black plastic helps. The webcam is the best I've ever seen on a notebook, unfortunately I don't really care. One flaw is that it doesn't pivot so you must adjust your position in the camera by sitting in a higher chair or moving the screen so the display image is washed out. In my normal working position the webcam shows my face from the eyebrows up.Everything works well and the machine is very fast, very competent. I've had no problems with connectors or quality (except the lid) or any of the lockups mentioned in other reviews. It works well, weighs a ton and looks stupid.I would love to have bought one of ASUS' elegant machines. This one is a throwback retro design that mocks AlienWare and makes a deliberate pitch to an advertising concept of young gamers. Nothing wrong with that but there should be a high-res alternative for artists and power users and currently there isn't.If it sounds like I don't like the machine it's not true. I can live with the irritations but the three I mentioned first, no second HD, USB placement and the lighted keyboard really piss me off. They all should have been handled correctly. I wonder if the keyboard fiasco was intentional, thinking the excessive light pouring out around all the keys would turn on gamers. I can imagine the enormous heavy power brick being intentional too ""kids will love it because it's bigger than anyone else's"". Gamers are not that immature. It's like the marketing department was allowed to influence the design department in an unhealthy and insulting way (as is usual for marketing departments). ASUS builds great notebooks, among the best available imo, but this machine is targeted to such a slim market sector it demands another version that anyone could buy without feeling compromised in so many ways.ROG is hot, ASUS is hot, but this machine just looks silly.","November 5, 2010",

laptops,Great comp...but got a lemon.,"D. Angeloni ""DKAngel12""",R2TLES7373F1MY,3,"I bought the G51jx-x3 computer after doing a lot of research, knowing it was the best bang for the buck out there...and it is. Unfortunately after 30 mins of firing it up and downloading Window 7 updates I started to receive random blue screens; this consistently happened every 3-30 minutes. I thought I unfortunately had the same BIOS problem that some are complaining about who own a G51 series laptop. I then tried a system restore which failed to solve the problem; I knew at this point I had a hardware problem. Windows memory checker confirmed this. Got ASUS tech support on and they walked me though everything I already had done...after an hour they finally came to the same conclusion I had already come to. Shipped the package off to them today; they said it will take 3-4 business days to look at and repair. I'm looking forward to getting it back as it looks and feels great. Minus the bad hardware (RAM by Kingston) I would recommend this computer if you are willing to look past ASUS lack of QC. At least their support is decent so far.","April 7, 2010",

laptops,Laptop Overheats With Nothing But Chrome Open,Ariela R.,R2SVFSX9SS1MFI,3,"I loved this computer, even though the battery life is practically 0 (read: no more than 60 minutes max) ... I loved this computer even though the speakers are very poor ... I loved this computer even though it's bulky and so heavy that after only 15 minutes my shoulder is sore for at least 2 days ... It has a pretty damn good graphics card, 2 harddrives, a rather fast processing speed and was meant to be a replacement for a desktop computer while overseas.I use this computer for work and for play and, to be fair, I do have it on just about all the time (except in transport and ...). However, with all of these ""even thoughs"" and the positive aspects combined, there is one serious thing that has just about ruined this laptop for me: It shuts off entirely randomly whenever it overheats. And it overheats a lot. Like, 1 tab in Chrome open (gmail) and iTunes playing a movie and absolutely nothing else open and it crashes. I've tried 2 different laptop fan/cooling pads for it and they don't help (it's crashed 4 times in the last hour while connected to one of the cooling pads). This has been going on for the last couple of weeks and I've had it. Such a shame, had greater hopes from this small but powerful machine ... especially considering it's supposed to be for gaming (I do nothing more 'serious' than the occasional Sims 3 once in a blue moon, imagine this ""gaming"" laptop being used by actual avid gamers!).Hopefully Amazon and Asus will be able to find a suitable solution.","January 14, 2011",
laptops,expected much more from Asus,Aaron,RMVITKHE7KA05,3,"I gave this computer 3-stars because it does what I need it to do and the technical specs are pretty good. Not great for the price, but good.Pros: has great sound, which is important to me. the SRS Premium Sound panel takes alot of playing with to get a good sound with whatever speakers you are using. I normally hate laptops mostly cause the mouse pads, but they copied Apple (in a good way) and made it so you can use 2 fingers anywhere on the pad and scroll instead of having a scroll bar on the side or whatever. I've found myself using other laptops and being confused by their lack of convenience. USB 3.0 makes transferring all my data alot easier and my phone and ipod charges super quick when i use the usb cable.Cons: only a few days after the 30-day zero bright dot warranty expired i found a few dead pixels, that strangely seem to come and go. the entire thing is very flimsy; the keyboard depresses quite a bit when typing and the screen flexes as if nothing is behind the screen giving it support. it comes with a TON of preloaded games and Asus software, some of which im afraid to uninstall for fear of messing up the OS or BIOS. Pay attention to where your pictures and music and things are saved, as the default path leads to the smaller ""OS"" partition and it will fill up very quickly. The mouse gets annoying and worn out fairly quick. Even with trying to adjust the sensitivity it either grabs on to an internet tab or something and wont let go or it has a hard time double clicking. The webcam is less than 1 mp, so dont expect to do anything other than take a (well-lit) picture with it. I tried video chatting with my sister and there was so much delay she could see me moving at all. It was basically just audio.This thing puts out ALOT of heat, especially if you're playing a game or exporting a video or something. Fan sometimes has a hard time keeping the system cool even with proper ventilation, and making the whole thing hot and burning your leg anyway. I've almost melted my glasses by leaving them on the left side of the computer (where the vent is). Also if youre doing something very processor taxing such as gaming or video editing, make sure the vent is very well exposed. I know thats kind of a no-brainer, but I was exporting a video and tried storing it away in my very large and open keyboard tray while it did its thing. I opened it up to find it had almost melted its own screen. there was a big air bubble that went away when i flexed the screen towards me (something you probably shouldnt be able to do). The screen has gotten air bubbles from having the lid closed while doing nothing more than a virus scan.So when it comes down to it, either look for a different model than this (N61JQ-A1) altho im pretty sure they dont make it anymore, or wait a month or 2 and you can get a much better system from any company with better specs for same price or less. BTW, the X1 is the same thing with a different hard drive size, so just keep that in mind.*UPDATE* Their customer service is HORRIBLE. I sent this back in for warranty repair a month ago and never heard back despite two emails and a whole new 'Tech Request'. Maybe calling will have better luck?","April 8, 2011",

laptops,GPU may overheat and cause laptop to shut down,Zephine,R5IMR7F44QHAH,3,"I had the G73JH-A1 for almost two weeks before it shutdown while playing a game. A web search for G73JH and shutdown showed it could be overheating problems. I installed desktop gadgets that monitored the CPU and GPU and tested by playing various games. While closely watching and frequently checking the GPU temperature, it was generally anywhere from the mid 90s to just over a 100 and at times would reach 107 degrees.After reading more on the web, I downloaded the FurMark benchmark utility and tried the stability test. In less than 3 minutes, the laptop reached 110 degrees and shut down. If the GPU ran hotter than a ""normal"" 95 degrees, but remained at a constant 100 or 101 degrees without reaching critical temperature, it might have been acceptable. Perhaps by using a cooling pad and making sure the ambient room temperature wasn't higher than 90 I could do without having to send my G73JH for service. But the fact that a gaming laptop could overheat to shutdown with GPU intensive programs meant an unstable video card.Just to make sure it wasn't the benchmark utility, I tested it on my desktop computer which has an ATI 5770. It ran at a constant 96 degrees for 15 minutes. A friend installed FurMark on her laptop with an nVidia 360m and it was stable at 85 degrees.I'm glad this happened during my first 30 days. Instead of having Asus replace the video card or entire laptop with possibly a refurbished one even though I had just purchased it new, I had Amazon issue me a RMA for an exchange. Hopefully there's one in stock when it reaches them because I really did like this laptop and am willing to give it another chance.Aside from the GPU overheating and having to deal with an exchange, there were some minor cons. I won't bother with what I liked because it's been covered by plenty of other reviews.- The screen is way too glossy, causing lots glare and reflection on the monitor.- After a week the spacebar sometimes made a squeeking noise.- Dedicated volume buttons would have been easier than having to use both hands to press two keys, the Fn + F11 or F12.- I wish the Numlock light was on the right side of the keyboard near the number keys. Instead it's on the left side of the laptop, beside the Capslock key.- On the Numberpad, the right arrow key is under the 1 and the 0 is under the 2. I'm used to pressing 0 with my thumb and have been trying to get used to the shorter 0 key.- The touchpad bar for the mouse buttons is difficult to press. I'm glad I use a separate mouse.- This laptop is so big it doesn't fit in my old 17"" laptop case. Asus provides a decent backpack but it's on the thin side and won't hold more than one or two textbooks. Be careful and make sure you buy a laptop case or backpack large enough.4-stars if the laptop didn't overheat but 3-stars because of the lemon. If Amazon is able to send another for an exchange I'll update this review again when I receive the replacement.Update July 9, 2010: Received my exchange today. I have to really commend Amazon's return service. It was very easy to request an RMA and they even refunded me the shipping costs for sending it back to them!After initial setup, the first thing I did was install Furmark and then I held my breath. I can let out a sigh of relief. After 5 minutes it was at 90 degrees, and after 20 minutes this new G73JH-A1 was running at 93 degrees. It might have hit 94 or even 95 but I think 20 minutes was enough to confirm it's stability.A couple of other things about this laptop:- The included mouse's buttons are very sensitive. My fingers sometimes press a top or side button when I pick it up to move the cursor. Will take a little getting used to since the buttons are so delicate.- I wish Asus had included recovery discs with this laptop. Perhaps it was a cost cutting measure. After all, this is a $1650 laptop that other companies would easily charge $2100 or more. Regardless, I don't mind because if I uninstall the bloatware and run Windows Update, I can have bloat-free updated recovery discs.Despite all the nitpicking, this is an incredible gaming laptop. Quad-core CPU for future programs and games, 8 gigs of RAM, Blu-Ray player, and one of the best laptop video card currently available, the ATI mobility 5870.","July 2, 2010",

No game I threw at it was an issue.I'd just like to caution buyers on a few points:The ATI drivers for this model are not well-supported. You WILL run into driver problems. I ended up keeping two sets of drivers handy since one set completely wouldn't work with OpenGL.Heat can be an issue. You may want to prop the machine up. Also make sure there is at least a foot or so behind the rear of the laptop for the vents. Even with these precautions I ended up having the laptop overheat a few times during the warmer months.The screen is decent, but there are much better out there. I felt that the quality was mediocre at best.This is a VERY heavy and cumbersome laptop. I knew that going into it, but be warned.

The touch pad area is so static sensitive that I am constantly having to Ctrl-Z in order to reverse edit all kinds of bizarre stuff that happens to whatever text I am writing. You almost have to use an external keyboard with this machine. If it were not for Ctrl-Z, I would have returned the machine a long time ago. This machine was obviously not beta tested enough.Granted, any machine with a touch pad has problems in this area. But this machine has a huge touch pad approximately 2.5""x4.5"" big and is by far the worst one I have ever dealt with. You might think having a huge touch pad is a good thing until you have one. Believe me it is a liability, not an asset. You only have to get a fraction of an inch above it to activate it. You don't actually have to touch it. And when you do accidentally touch it, the format changes in MS Word, for example, can be really bizarre and extremely annoying.It would not be so bad if you could adjust the touch pad sensitivity. Toshiba machines, for example, allow you to adjust the sensitivity. But no such parameter exists on this machine. Believe me, I have looked for it. Ideally I would like to be able to shut off the touch pad altogether, but the hardware management on this machine does not allow it.My recommedation is that if you are planning to get this machine, plan on getting an external keyboard with it. ...And learn how to use Ctrl-Z. Other than the keyboard issue, it is really a good machine. It is fast and responsive. The screen is excellent. I have used it with an external monitor and am happy with the result. The resolution on the external monitor is not as high as I would like it to be, but I am not sure if it is the graphics card in the computer or the monitor itself that has limitations.If you are looking for a laptop with portability, I do not recommend this machine. It is large and bulky. Although it is light for it's size, it is still a big machine. And when you hull this machine around, you have no choice but to use the awful keyboard. Carrying around an external keyboard just isn't practical. So if a low price point is important to you and you can live with the impracticality of the keyboard and awkward portability, then you might consider this machine. Otherwise, I would say look somewhere else.Added later: I finally realized you can overcome a lot of the keyboard problems by putting the power supply (or some other similar sized object) under the back edge of the computer so as to jack up the back of the computer and tilt the plane of the keyboard. It makes a huge difference. The heels of your thumbs are much less likely to trigger the touch pad.","October 28, 2010",
laptops,Has Problems which will cause frustration,"CD066 ""Cd066""",R1DHM7LKGZD9ZP,3,"I am editing this review for the following reasonsAfter about 10 days of use I started to get a large number of crashes related directly to the following software:Creative EAX / Audigy / Creative HD Sound suite - this is included with the computer.ATI Catalyst 10.6BIOS 205This was very frustrating because the computer would not operate for more than 5 or 10 minutes without the screen locking up, or what was most likely to happen; the screen became a crazed rainbow of various colors which are indicative of a problem of some type (slight understatement).I contacted ASUS tech support via an online help request. If you have never dealt with ASUS tech support before I will forewarn you that it is pretty much non-existent. If you are expecting some snappy responses to what you may feel are serious (in your mind) problems you will be sadly mistaken. ASUS is really good at making products which are high performance and for the most part need little in the way of tech support, so as you American's might be misled to believe that because they make such good products there should be great tech support - this is absolutely not the case.After a couple of days I received a response from ASUS tech support - I was instructed to remove all the Creative Sound Suite software (that means all of it including drivers); remove ATI Catalyst 10.6 along with all display drivers from ATI, and revert back to the ATI Catalyst 9.12 Win7 64bit edition. Following install of 9.12 Catalyst I was to then install VGA drivers from G73JH download page from ASUS notebook support.I performed all these actions as requested by ASUS tech support and have had a perfectly sound and stable computer since. I am not certain of the exact nature of the problem. The speculation I have encountered ranges from over voltage to the ATI 5870 Card to flawed software drivers in the sound card which induce an over-voltage - who knows for sure. If these steps did not correct the problem and I continued to receive GSOD or random lockups ASUS was prepared to offer me RMA with replacement.I still rate the computer highly as I do have a perfectly operating machine....now....but I can see that someone who only purchased this ASUS G73JH because it looked like one of the best out could be easily fooled. I would offer this as a word of caution to anyone looking to purchase a high performance laptop or computer of any type:1. Do your research2. Know what kinds of problems the unit is having and if they are able to be overcome3. Have the skill necessary to address the problems that `will' crop up4. Have patienceFYI - I find the keyboard a little unresponsive at times this is due to several possibilities -1. Synaptics Mouse Pad driver is suspected of being flawed and conflicts with the keyboard drivers somehow. I have read on several sites that removal of the mousepad drivers and reverting to the use of the Win7 drivers is key to fixing this problem.2. Possibility of tarnished / corroded connector pins under the keyboard due to poor construction techniques or a bad batch of keyboards from the Hyu Yuan subcontractor. Keyboard must be removed and using Tricloroethnal (Tri-C) clean off the connectors pin surface on both male and female portions of keybord ribbon connector.- The mouse included with the computer is great - use that.- There is a ton of bloatware on this computer mostly crap like trial edition this and that. Just get rid of it and you will free up quite a bit of space.I strongly reccomend the use of a good laptop cooler of some kind; Zalman makes a great one and so does Targus.","June 25, 2010",
laptops,"Very nice specs, but the design needs to be improved.","Eduardo Castellanos ""wayo""",R1QMC2QG4E6M97,3,"I have read most of the other reviews and so far the biggest problem I've found is that the computer overheats.After owning this laptop for about 9 months I can personally say that the two major drawbacks are the following:1. It is very easy for the fan vents to become obstructed by dust/lint, and very hard to clean. This caused my laptop to overheat and shut down whenever I tried to play any game. In order to clean the vents you have to remove the processor's and video card's heatsink. This is a major problem as you would also need to re-apply the thermal paste...2. It is very hard to open the computer and clean it, and it is very probable that you are going to break the keyboard because it's held in place by double sided tape. There's a video in [..] that describes how to disassemble the laptop.","December 22, 2010",
laptops,"Peace of mind, but at a price and not quite a Windows substitute?",Gladius,RNW1SVERA7INO,3,"I purchased this and an Asus 13.3 inch u30jc at the same time. The Asus was $879. I did keep the Apple and return the Asus as the Asus screen had a lot of glare for my tastes; occasionally videos looked too dark to enjoy on the Asus. They are similar machines except that the Asus includes Optimus with 512mg of video memory and a discrete video card. It also has an i3-350 vs. the Apple's 2.4 core duo. The Apple is better built.The good: The Apple is well built and has an excellent screen for a laptop. Good battery life. The genius bar is two miles away and bulletin boards with many Mac users are only a few clicks away. Snow Leopard is relatively easy to learn and one has excellent customer service for 90 days.The problems: some software is not written for Mac or has a subpar version for Mac. Think of games or playing chess online.Worse, the 2.4 core duo does not belong on a $1,199 machine. Many $899 machines now have i5s this summer. (Apple can't put a i5 on its low end pro model or even an i3 as it would then butt heads with the $1,799 15 inch macbookpro.) These same machines also typically offer 500gig hard drives that run at 7,200. Some have discrete graphics. (Few have battery life to compare with that of this machine, but the aforementioned Asus u30jc with an i3 does.) Customer service is good but only 90 days unless one springs for Apple Care, making the price even more unreasonable.I could deal with a premium price if the machine had a 3.06 core duo or a low level i3. And a discrete graphics card with, say, 512mg of VRAM.Soon, someone is going to come up with a machine that has the build quality of the macbookpro and superb customer service. The machine will then be over-priced and somewhat obsolete by all measures.Excellent machine but Apple need not be so greedy.BMW's are overpriced. My 335i, which I lease, is not worth the price even though I used to track them. It does, however, have 300hp. The Apple is more akin to a 4 cylinder Accord. Well built and popular, but only reasonably powered.","July 21, 2010",
laptops,Power supply the Achilles heel of this Macbook Pro,Keith,R3682ZKI5779GX,3,"Purchased new Macbook Pro 13"" for spouse in August, 2010. She and my daughter use it for school (grad school for her, high school for the daughter), and both have become very dependent on it. I bought it because she just had to have one (she's a teacher) and I wanted something ultra-reliable for her to use (I spend too much time in my IT job fixing Windows PCs, primarily problems due to viruses, hard drive crashes, etc.). I just wanted to spend the extra bucks and not have to worry with her system. Up till a week ago, everything was great and I was very happy with my purchase, albeit a bit poorer because of it.The power supply that currently comes with the both the standard Macbook and the 13"" Macbook Pro is the 60w L-connector model, and mine failed this week (right before Thanksgiving), November, 2010. I went back to the major electronics chain store where I bought it, since it was less than than four months old, and was told that since I did not buy an extended warranty, it was not covered under the regular warranty by Apple (nor is the battery, but that is true for all laptop manufacturers) and my only choice was to buy a replacement power supply for $80. WTF?????Based on my reading of numerous reviews here and elsewhere, and previously noting the excessive warmth of the defective unit on my MBP, I believe the 60W L-connector supply is either a) defective in materials and/or design, or b) severely underpowered for the application. I had acquired from a friend an old 85W Macbook Pro power supply with the T-connector that had a bad cord (another defective Apple design, also, but this was a poor mechanical design of the strain relief on the cord). I was able to crack it open and repair the frayed cord, so that I could have something to charge the battery while I wait for a replacement supply to arrive by mail (I am NOT paying $80 for a replacement in a retail store). This older 85W unit does not run hot at all when charging or in operation, and works great with the laptop. I would recommend to anyone buying a replacement power supply to avoid the P.O.S. 60W L-connector model, or better yet, avoid a 60W power supply altogether as being underpowered and inadequate, and buy an 85W supply instead. The replacement I ordered is an 85W T-connector model.One other issue noted by other reviewers is a problem with the newer L-connector vs the older T-connector. Although the L-connector cord does not stick out as far from the side of the laptop as the T-connector cord, if you flip it over so that the cord runs alongside the laptop, the cord covers and blocks access to several of the ports on the side of the laptop; not so with the older T-connector. The whole point of the original MagSafe design was that you could just plug it it without being too particular about it, since it works regardless of the orientation of the plug. Some of the convenience of the MagSafe design is now negated with the L-connector.Looks like Apple has dropped the ball on this one, spec'ing an undersized supply or going with a low-budget crappy Chinese manufacturer, and based on the number of complaints I've seen in these reviews, I believe they are pushing a defective product, since this has been known for more than a year and yet they are still selling them. Most Windows-based PC manufacturers warrant their power supplies for a year, and since Apple does not (or has stopped doing so), I would guess they are very aware of this defect but want to avoid admitting it publicly because of the embarrassment it has become to the company and the potential it has for litigation. Or maybe they think they can make some more money selling extra power supplies....To spend this kind of money on a laptop (nearly three times as much as a comparable Windows PC) and have the power supply die after four months is simply ridiculous. To have Apple exclude it from a basic one-year warranty is even more ridiculous. Buyer's beware! A Macbook Pro may be a great laptop, but if you can't power it up, it is simply a brick. This power supply truly is the weak link, the Achilles heel, of what should otherwise be a great product.Apple, you may have shaved off $5 on the manufacturing costs with this power supply, but this particular decision will cost you a whole more than it saved, in the long run. Shame on you! I expect this kind of stuff from low-budget PC manufacturers, but not from Apple, and not after paying three times as much for the mystical Apple reliability. In the end, you apparently are no different from any other PC manufacturer, other than you charge more for your product.","November 28, 2010",
laptops,I expected a lot more.,"Marcelo, BR ""Marcelo Teixeira""",R2USCQUXO3IKKN,3,"MacBook Pro 13-inch 2.4GHzI own this macbook pro 13"" for over 6 months now and I gotta say that I expected a lot more from it. If you want a laptop to light use I do recommend a 13 inches macbook pro, if you need a full computer usability, the 13 inches is not for you, get a 15/17 inches core i5/i7 version.*PROS:1 Nice design - Looks great, nice aluminum well finished body, nice screen resolution, seems really solid.2 No virus problems.3 Good webcam quality.4 Good built in mic quality.5 Long battery lasting, around 7 hours (light use)6 Useful illuminated keyboard.7 Light weight8 Nice glass touchpad.*CONS:1 Believe me, MAC freezes! I bought this macbook because I've heard of its stability, but I was wrong, it freezes as often as I use ""heavy"" applications or Microsoft softwares. And you cant go back to work without restarting the computer using the power button!2 Disappointing video card. Doesn't handle even light pictures adjustments without minutes seen that little colored circle asking you to wait, that is just unacceptable for a macbook pro.3 Most Apple softwares are not so complete and easy to use as others say, its hard to manage email contacts, you cant add them easily from your email, the software erases all your emails from your email account from the first access, need to adjust that manually, besides is gonna ask you the password over and over again all day long, no matter what you do; doesn't recognize windows files (fat32/NTFS format used in your pen drive or external HD), you must buy and install an special software for that; the Iwork doesn't replace fully the MS Office; the Aperture is to basic if compared with Photoshop or similar; Itunes is freaky to use; the Quicktime doesn't run avi, Divx or most of nowadays video formats, you must get Quicktime pro for that or pay for a bunch of plugins; the Finder (Apple Explorer) is not able to search a file in a specific folder, is gonna check all your folders; you cant maximize to the biggest screen possible at the proper button, you must adjust the screen manually every time, very annoying.4 The keyboard gets dirty and greasy easily, looks like someone used oil in a cotton to ""clean it up"", and have a large space under the keys, that keeps the dirt under it, they seems to have not project that very well.5 It gets very hot with heavy applications.6 No separated mic and headphones connections, they are the same, very awkward for a Pro unit.7 The informations under it (serial number, etc) are almost gone, its erasing easily with just a few months.8 Firewire port is not the standard one, you must get a proper Apple cable.9 You need also to buy an Apple adapter to video out.10 Just two USB ports.11 No blu-ray reader available on Macs at all.12 Small and slow hard drive for the price.13 I expected a lot more performance out of a core 2 duo processor on a MAC OS, video editing or large pictures editing is not reasonable on this unit, HD videos is just unthinkable, get a core i5/i7 with a discrete video card and a ssd driver if po$$ible.14 Speakers are not loud enough for Skype use or video watching if you're not in a closed and very quite space.Overall its a good equipment, but miles away from perfection.

The sickening thing is its mostly just a software issue - even though the pad is too small, if it could do 2 finger tapping I would up it to 4 stars.Also the Bluetooth software using the Atheros chips does not auto-connect to Stereo audio devices - and that is annoying as well.ACER fix those 2 things and you have a winner!","June 16, 2011",
laptops,good on the go,lotus turtle,R8CX3X5ZPVJ8T,3,"Got this for about a week now, as a college student, the light weight at 3 lbs (lighter than my lightest text book) is great along with some good processing power. Did some hd video editing that really pushed the cpu to its limits, but didn't over heat or crashed as my previous machine. Handles multiple tasks at once nicely. The screen is awesome, though have yet to see any dead pixels (just hope I don't jinx it) and with 3 usb ports, it meets all my everyday needs. Fairly quite, so it wont disturb anyone in class, even under high cpu usuage, it humms a lil bit, but not noisy. My major complaint is the track pad feels a lil generic and the multi touch gestures are not as responsive as the mac air, to me it seems like a last minute thing acer just tacked on. There are times when I literally had to tap my finger on the side of the track pad just so it would register a scroll. Furthermore, due to its lack of a dedicated graphics, don't think about playing much graphic intensive games. I was able to push out 6-7 hours on high lighting from playing games, video editing, and internet surfing. The web cam is very basic and speakers are oddly under the machine, so sound isn't going to be too high in quality. For those of you that need something to just pull out and do a few online problems, school intensive assignments, photo or video editing, or even watch some hd movies on the go, this lap top is great. 4 gb of ram, up to 2.53 ghz with turbo boost, its pretty decent for its size. Be nice if it had a decent graphics card, but with a machine this small, I don't think playing big titles would be ideal. for roughly 650, its probably the biggest bang for your buck as far as ultra portables. With an extremely easy upgradable bay, you can put extra ram or an ssd without much fuss.","November 29, 2011",
laptops,Nice but some isssues,Stuart M. Schwartz,RKUU7DADWVQUC,3,"I'm moving up from an Acer Aspire One that I've been using for a couple of years. I like the bigger screen, extra power, Bluetooth and HDMI. The form factor is nice as it's thin and flat.Here are some issues I'm having with this product that I didn't have with my old netbook:My biggest annoyance is that when I suspend and then resume on this laptop, the WiFi is turned off. So even though it comes out of suspend quickly, you then have to hit FN + F3 and then use the cursor to click on WiFi. I've tried every setting I can think of but to no avail. I'd love to edit this review if someone can tell me how to fix this. It seems to be a lot of extra steps to have to do for a device that's primary purpose is an easy way to access the Net.The track pad, at least mine, has one deficit. Like most track pads you can quickly double-click on something to grab and hold something such as moving a window around or to grab the scroll bar for small movements. The problem is that sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn't. I'm pretty sure it's a hardware issue since I uninstalled the ALPS driver and loaded in the Synaptic's driver and it still had the same issue.A minor issue I've solved with a small cloth is the front LED lights. I like to keep my laptop on my night stand when I sleep. The small blue LEDs are very bright and shine latterly straight out where it acts almost like having a small flashlight pointed at you in the dark. I found it impossible to sleep next to it without covering the lights.","July 9, 2011",

I would have loved to give it a 5 out of 5, but there are two main issues I am having problems with.1) The battery life is not good. I am running things on low CPU, dim light, shut down background processes, and am running a HIGH time of 2 hours. Not good enough. Thankfully I don't use the battery power as much as a normal user, but it's still annoying for when I do. The battery software included designed to make it run longer isn't helping either.2) Just some strange things with certain keys. Having to press the space bar key 2 or 3 times to get a space. A lot of the keyboard shortcuts in various programs not working. I found a strange way to runaround this issue, and that's by pressing the ""Escape"" key twice, then keyboard shortcuts will work. But this will only last until I move to a new program where they won't work anymore. Back to the ""Escape"" key...strange.I'm not even sure if these problems would be for everyone, or just me. As it is, it's sort of frustrating, but the overall experience is worth it, in my opinion, for a great computer. I wish it were perfect, with the 4.5 hours of battery life it claims and the keyboard not being screwy, but it's okay as it is even with these issues.","March 7, 2011",
laptops,One huge flaw,M. Rogers,R1A28XAAY8J0AB,3,"It's an otherwise fine computer - looks great, reasonably fast, etc. But I swear the touchpad was designed by a retarded, no-handed monkey. It's ridiculously bad. If I hadn't actually paid a lot of money for the computer (two of them actually, for my kids) I would think it was funny. In this day and age, I don't see how technology could be so bad without it being intentional. To clarify, I did try to adjust the settings, to no avail. And the problem is on both computers, so it's not a quirk of one unit. It's not that it's too sensitive, as some people say, it's almost the opposite: you move the cursor and it doesn't go where your finger tells it to, then when you lift your finger off to click the button, it moves (no matter how carefully you lift it).

As a programmer I like to modify my system to my requirements. This is my first windows 7 system and apparently this (no disks) is common practice. It still seems strange to me but it is not unique to Samsung as I initially thought. As far as the Samsung customer service, I do think they should offer a link to the Windows 7 ISO if they are expecting the customer to figure it out. Otherwise they should offer a system cd upon request.The laptop itself is pretty nice. I am not sure if the battery actually lasts for 7 hours but the battery life is certainly better than my macbook which also advertises 7 hours of battery life.The one thing I don't like about the design is the placement of the arrow keys on the keyboard.

""Tempting Reviews""",RF79OAIJ0JQ99,3,"One must understand the difference between those two terms in order to understand my review of this computer. For the record, I am not anti-Apple. I own a 17"" MacBook Pro which I cannot live without and a 27"" iMac that runs my home setup. I have an Airport Extreme, Airport Express, and a Time Capsule running my home network and backups. An iPod Touch is connected in my car for music management. I don't care for iOS devices, so I have an Android phone, not an iPhone. No iPad, I think it's too limited to be of any appeal. But the iPad and this MacBook Air fit in one category: Appeal without value.See, the reason you see so many 5-star reviews is not because of value. It's because of appeal. Same with the iPad and iPad 2. The reality is, these devices look appealing. They go into areas that others have yet to broach (Samsung is the closest).

Backed with the strength of Apple's support outlets, you can't help but think that this, as well as the iPad, are ""magical"". The reality hits you in the face: they have appeal. They do NOT have value. Unfortunately, so many people ignore the straight-up mathematics of it that they will never understand what I'm trying to say. I'm going to set the iPad aside in my discussion, but know that it fits in the same general category, and everything I say here applies to it.If you've been living under a rock, the 11"" MacBook Air is one of the newer directions that Apple has set for its portables. The form factor feels just right, the weight is near perfect, and it boasts the full OS X experience.From a hardware perspective things don't look so rosy.The backlit keyboard of the previous generation has been removed inexplicably. The screen quality pales in comparison to the MacBook Pro (and I'm talking about general quality in real-world situations, NOT stated quality on a spec sheet). The silver border almost makes the machine look cheap, especially since it doesn't feature a matte display like a similarly equipped Pro would. The CPU, while ""good enough"", is just not a powerhouse in either configuration, and Apple, as always, forces you to opt for the 13"" model to even get a CPU that is capable of higher end computing - you know, things like Logic Studio Retail. Given the thickness of the machine is identical in both the 11"" and 13"", it's frustrating that you cannot put a stronger processor in the 11"". In theory, you should be able to throw a 2.2 in there without too much trouble, but then of course Apple would have to actually offer these things at a fair price. There's also no Ethernet port (given how thin it is), no optical drive (which might be a plus for you), and no external media card reader. For this latter option you're forced yet again to go for the 13"" Air. If the idea is to go smaller and agile and wireless, you would think an SD card slot would be feasible. There certainly is room for it on the right side. I should also point out that you cannot upgrade the RAM on this by yourself since Apple saw fit to solder it to the board. That means if you buy any model with 2GB RAM and regret it after your return window, you're SOL. Unfortunately, as everyone knows, Apple charges a steep premium for its RAM upgrades over third party vendors. This, in my opinion, makes the MacBook Air - both 11"" and 13"" - just not appealing options for anyone but the willfully oblivious.The 11"" actually comes in lots of different configurations:- Base model: 64GB SSD, 1.4GHz processor, 2GB RAM- Base model with more storage: 128GB SSD, 1.4GHz processor, 2GB RAM- Base model with storage and RAM: 128GB SSD, 1.4GHz processor, 4GB RAM- Higher end model with storage: 128GB SSD, 1.6GHz processor, 2GB RAM- ""Ultimate"": 128GB SSD, 1.6GHz processor, 4GB RAMThe local Apple Store will usually stock the base model with storage, rather than the ""Ultimate"", inexplicably. Perhaps it has something to do with the fact that the ""Ultimate"" ends up being quite pricey - to the point of being almost the same price as the base model 13"" - yet at half the power and storage of that model. Makes no sense, and therein lies my second complaint with the machine: its price. If I boiled the Base model down to its core components, it's $799. Period. Apple wants $999 for that model. At first, I didn't understand Apple's pricing methodology, but now I think I've figured it out. They price based on the maximum component price at the time they design it, without taking into proper consideration the component price at the time they sell it. For example, I know that right now I can go and buy a 64GB SSD for a little over $100. In Apple's world, it's $200, because that's what the price was when they were designing the thing. I can't fault them for that logic necessarily, but it lessens the value (there's that word again) of the MacBook Air in my opinion. Better to select the Pro, where you can buy your own drive/RAM and save hundreds over Apple's configurations yet get superior performance and value. What you lose is Apple's support of the drive/RAM, but most storage manufacturers offer decent warranties so you don't really have to worry about it that much.When you look at the 13"" MacBook Pro vs. either of the Airs, you start to shake your head at the sheer lunacy of things. No matter what Air configuration you go with, you're overpaying compared to the Pro. The only appeal (there's THAT word again) of the Air over the Pro is the form factor. The ""instant on"" is negated when you install a SSD in the Pro. The Pro can hold more RAM than the Air, allowing it to do more multitasking. The Pro, equipped with 4GB RAM and a good SSD, can boot faster than either Air - proven in numerous videos. The Pro will run pretty much whatever you throw at it, where the Air struggles on certain apps such as Final Cut and InDesign. The Pro can have larger drives added at your leisure, the Air cannot. The Pro can have its RAM upgraded, the Air cannot. It's REALLY hard to justify a $1199 MacBook Air 11"" with only 2GB of RAM, when you can get a 13"" MacBook Pro for the same price with 4GB of RAM and a processor on its BASE model that is 5x superior to the strongest Air.And so I come to the part that people just don't understand: Value vs. appeal. Value means, for the money I'm paying, is what I got worth it? And I don't mean ""worth it to me"", I mean WORTH IT. The answer here is no. The 11"" MacBook Air is not a good value. It is an appealing machine - great form factor, travels well, feels nice, good battery life. But the value is not there. A price point not exceeding $800 would have made the machine right on the top border of a good value. If you ever plan to sell it, the resale value is not there. People are not wanting to pay even $800 for it because they don't see it worth it for the lower end model; that's telling. If you're one such person that is willing to pay for appeal...meaning you have no qualms about paying a clear premium for something because it appeals to you...then by all means the 11"" MacBook Air is fine. But in this day and age when people should be considering true value and whether they're getting their money's worth out of a device, the Air falls flat at its current price point and hardware configuration.If you look at true value, the 13"" MacBook Pro is the best dollars-and-cents value Apple offers at this time of all of its hardware. If you look at true appeal, and are willing to pay a premium for it and disregard true value, then yes, the 11"" MacBook Air wins of all of the devices. Should you choose to lean that direction, if nothing else, get the ""Ultimate"". It's still grossly underpowered. But trust me, the alternative will leave you stuck with a machine that won't meet your long-term needs.","June 4, 2011",

laptops,13-inch used MacBook from Beta Macs,Swayambu V. Ramani,R1DHPWYH7PJVE6,3,"The MacBook, a late 2006 edition, with OS X 10.6.8 (Snow Leopard) and iWorks looks immaculate when opened, though showing significant wear on both the top and bottom outside covers. Battery life is as advertised by Apple for this model. The laptop runs hot (hot to the palms). My main objection is the ""scuff marks"" on the screen, which is a problem with LCD screens, it appears. People clean screens with any thing and any means, it appears, not knowing the very, very delicate nature of LCD screens (displays). If I was the Product Manager of Apple laptops, I will have a printed notice in red ink with every Mac warning about cleaning screens matter-of-factly - - people use windex, tap-water soaked cloth or paper-towel, etc., etc., and cause stains and scuff marks, like my laptop has (on arrival). Fortunately, I cannot see these stains/scuff marks when the screen is lit-up/laptop being used (occasionally, I see the outlines but barely). When the screen is dark, the stains/scuff marks look terrible. Why did Beta Macs (Company that sold me the laptop) not bother to remove these stains? Obviously, they cannot! For $400 I paid for this ancient (2006) laptop, if there are going to be blemishes, like a bad screen, the seller should lower the price by $100 and not call the laptop condition: ""very good""!

laptops,Decent little tech as you save up for something better for your early teen,Papagood,R2ISRTZWEIZI7S,3,"I bought this chromebook knowing what I was getting in to; small piece of tech so that the early teenage boy can spend hours watching youtube videos and quick facebook chatting, etc.It is a very nice look piece of equipment (of course, they took the aesthetics from Apple!!) My early teen needed something to hold him over because I was tired of him borrowing mom's laptop (which I paid good money for) to play sub-par video games and watching videos. Since I knew this is exactly what he would do with any piece of tech in his hand, I figured I can use one of these to make him feel special at the same time have something a little portable at a decent price and leave mom's laptop alone (win, win and win).It has the macbook look and feel (for a fraction of the price) decent screen resolution and very good battery life. The cons outweigh the pros by a landslide unfortunately. These are my personal cons so its up to how the user sees fit, so don't get offended by my review. Here goes....the thing is slow, the 16gb of soldered, unexpandable memory is a no, it lags tremendously with even short youtube clips where you would have to refresh the page often or reboot even though there is hardly anything loaded on the thing. It has a hard time reading files form a usb stick even if it is at a recognizable format (videos especially, no matter how many times compressed, re-converted or chromebook friendly the video may be) but the worst part in my book which I really thought was a disappointment...the lack of apps in the chromebook app store by google. My goodness you would at least think that since these are the same people behind android and the fact that the chromebook is not as powerful as a newer android phone, that google would have a lot of the apps that do not require much processing power to operate. Such as certain media players that are great with older android phones which are slow. All in all, its not windows, its not OS X, its not android and its not iOS. Honestly folks for the price I paid, its not bad, but it is a disappointment because for the same price I could have bought a galaxy note and that thing would have done so much more.A side not, google docs isn't as great on this as it is on a web browser.","May 9, 2013",
laptops,"Sweet little machine, questionable reliability, lackluster service",grrlpup,R345VZZFRFGF2I,3,"I've been very happy with my Chromebook. It's lightweight and the keyboard feels good to type on. The dimensions of the screen make for some smallish typefaces while web-browsing, at least at default settings, but the screen is clear and I'm not constantly running out of room or having to scroll. Processing is fast enough for me, even when i have seven or eight tabs open. Non-HD video plays fine.A month or two after I got the Chromebook, the battery wouldn't charge, and the little charging light wouldn't light up. I think I'm pretty careful with it and don't travel around with it in a bag or anything, so I'm a little concerned about the Chromebook's durability. The charging jack almost has to be forced a little; it's not the smoothest-working.The Samsung website does not make it easy or convenient to open a repair ticket. Even though the Chromebook is under warranty, I had to pay shipping to the Texas repair facility. They did not keep me updated about receiving the Chromebook or where it was in the repair process. I could track it on the website, once I found the obscure corner where it could be looked up.The scheduled repair date was several days after they had received the package. The actual repair date was a day or two after scheduled, with no explanation. Overall, they seemed to be in no hurry and feel no obligation to keep me updated. The website asked for my feedback, but only in limited and annoying ways (e.g., a pop-up that obscured the screen I was trying to look at to ask me how helpful it had been).The impression I'm left with: the Chromebook is good for as long as it's good, but Samsung customer service is nothing to inspire brand loyalty.","August 29, 2013",

I don't fling red birds or waste time on social media sites, but I do use Google Drive and the Zoho office suites extensively.

I can deal with no Caps Lock key, but I need my Delete key. Not including one makes no sense. It doesn't quite smack of Microsoft's arrogance with regard to Windows 8, but the ""Google knows best"" attitude can take a hike. I've gotten enough of that attitude from the other two major players.

The good news is it's very light, the bad is that it feels somewhat cheap and plastic-y. I don't like the matte screen at all as things don't look sharp and clear, whether text or images. I tried hooking it up via HDMI to my 24"" ASUS monitor and even there the image quality was poor. I'm used to Windows and the big monitor and crisp looking images and text and don't want to regress to the level the Chromebook is at.I also didn't like the trackpad. It had that annoying tendency of jumping the cursor just as you went to click the button part of the pad. You're better off using the tap to click as that avoids the jumping. BTW, it seems the trackpads on many of the new devices coming out are a bit flaky.I wasn't impressed with Chrome OS. It didn't seem snappy or fast or robust. Once again it felt like a big regression from using Windows 7 or 8 or Android 4.2. I kept wanting to touch the screen as I'm spoiled by touch enabled devices and thought how much I'd rather just spend a little more (well actually about double more) and get a Windows 8 touchscreen device. I also own a Nexus 7 and 4 and I'm very happy with Android so it's not just a Window's bias.The best thing I can say about the Samsung Chromebook is that it is light and portable.","February 5, 2013",

I could make it print only by routing the print order through a Windows laptop, which then sent it to the printer. Quite cumbersome and a hassle to set up. All 3 devices are in a wireless network.Follow0up comment regarding Chrome Remote Desktop app: The Chromebook advises (as of 1/30/13) to ""stay tuned"" for an important feature of Remote Desktop -- the ability to access the Chromebook desktop from a remote PC or Mac. So you're out of luck for an unknown amount of time if you want to provide a little tech support to a friend or relative by taking control of their Samsung Chromebook remotely.

For example, I tried a new router in the classroom, and wasn't able to connect the Chromebooks to it. There just wasn't enough information (at least where I could find it) to tell what was wrong. I tried more than one set of security options on the router, with no improvement. Windows computers and Android phones were connecting easily.

On the other hand, it seems to discharge quickly in storage. I think it has something to do with how you shut it down, but it isn't obvious. It should probably default to a full shutdown when you close the lid, or have some way of detecting when it is discharging while doing nothing.It is also odd to have a device which is so internet (and Google) dependent.

laptops,Good Portability and Good Office Utility,Phyllis Rheiner,R17RU2A9CL3J29,3,"I ordered the Chrome Book because I wanted a portable device for note-taking and document access. (While I originally considered an ultra-book, I decided to keep separate applications with sensitive data like Quicken from other cloud-based documents. Based on that concern, I elected to maintain a home-based laptop and to buy the Chrome Book for on the go.) At $249, you cannot beat the price for the Chrome Book.The Chrome Book is extremely light-weight (~2 pounds) and meets my standards for portability. The keyboard is very comfortable and easier to use than a touch screen with either a stylus or an add-on keyboard. (I admit that I find it challenging to type on a touch screen and that I don't like fingerprints.) The device looks stylish.From a set-up perspective, it is important to ensure that your wi-fi encryption is set to WPA2. (Our router was originally set to use the older standard of WEP.) When I first turned on the Chrome Book, the device was extremely slow - taking many minutes to access a web page. As soon as I changed the encryption standard, the Chrome Book speed became good and responsive. If you are currently using WPA2, set-up is as easy as turning on the device and signing into Gmail.If you don't have wi-fi access, the Chrome Book does allow you off-line access to both Gmail and Google Drive.To gain full utility from this device, you need to buy-in to using Gmail and Google Drive. (You can access MS Office docs on a flash drive.) I have been impressed by the collaboration capabilities with Documents on Drive. (If you are committed to using Outlook or another reader to access your mail locally, the Chrome Book will NOT work for you.)Google makes available 100GB of storage on Drive for 2 years if you buy a Chrome Book. In order to take advantage of this storage, you need to search for Chrome Book ""goodies"" online.A disappointment with the Chrome Book is that you cannot access the New York Times application with off-line availability. (You can sign in and read the NY Times with the Skimmer application. You need wi-fi connectivity to use the Skimmer.) While I pay for an online Times subscription, the Chrome tablet application will not work. Every time you try to access an article, it prompts you to log-in but it then routes you back to the home page instead of opening the article. (If you look at the reviews on the Chrome Store web site, many users report the same problem.)While the Kindle Cloud application will allow you to access your newest book via the Chrome Book, it will not allow you to access your subscriptions.)I think this is a good device if you want a portable gadget for office functionality. If you are traveling and want access to entertainment, I don't think this is the optimal device.

I believe Google is working to fix this (they say that they have already fixed it, but my most recent update still will not allow me to use Netflix). I would have thought that this product would not have launched with such a critical unresolved problem. I also am discovering that Google does not have any traditional form of customer service outlets. All I was able to do was fill in an online form to a customer service ""ninja"", but as of yet I have not received a response. I would give the Chromebook 4.5 Stars if I could watch Netflix... 5 Stars if I was able to talk to one of their ""ninjas"" without waiting so long.I received the following error message:""Dear Chrome OS Device user,Streaming is not currently supported on your device.

laptops,Cannot connect to the network,unhappy,R3FH510DUZTEOL,3,"After wasting hours trying to get this new computer up and running I have hit a dead end.A screen opens that allows you to select the language that you want to use and what type of keyboard layout that you prefer.A third option asks you to ""Select a network"" but when the drop down menu opens, there is just the same list of languages shown in the ""Select a language"" drop down menu.There are no network options to select from.I am using the same router with another computer, a printer, and a Kindle so I know it is working.The Samsung Chromebook does not come with an owners manual and the online help from Google and Samsung is useless for this problem. I am just told to contact my internet provider who tells me to reboot my router and modem. That didn't help either. Right now I am out the money spent and cannot use the thing. I emailed the problem and got an answer back to check the icon on the bottom of the screen to see if internet access is turned on. How can I do that if I can't get past the setup screen? There are no icons yet.Update. I got my new Chrombook today and it was doing the same thing as the first one. I called 1-800-samsung and got a different consultant. Turns out the problem is the way the mouse works. I feel pretty stupid, but from reading the other reviews I find I'm not alone. The booklet that comes with the netbook doesn't tell you that to left click, you push the mouse down with one finger and to right click, you push the mouse down with 2 fingers. I was using the mouse to move the curser and pressing the enter key, thinking I was doing a left click. I am now setup so I can give it to my son for Christmas. Don't have enought experience to give it a higher review, but I am raising it from a one to a three because it works, but the instructions need work. Not everyone who buys it knows how to use the mouse so instructions in the booklet and when speaking to a consultant should be more detailed.","December 14, 2013",

It's very fast, boots up quickly, surfs the internet quick, never locks up, etc.However, I have a DSLR and I love to take photos of my family and nature, I am not a professional photographer. I mostly used web based editing so that wasn't the big issue. I did not like not being able to edit without going online though. The Chromebook does come with a basic image editor, and it works ok, WHEN you can get it to work. If I attempt to put more than 5 large image files and edit them the computer slows down dramatically. It's even worse when you are attempting to edit and save either from an external hard drive or to the cloud. The machine just does not handle large files well, it's very slow just even showing you the preview of the images before even attempting to open or edit them.So, my husband will getting this machine because it will be perfect for him since he does not edit photos and mainly watches movies or surfs the internet and I will be getting his old machine where I can run Picasa and open/edit images easily.So if you have a DSLR and think you are going to be doing light editing on this machine, think again.

laptops,"Minimalist, Bare-Bones, but Still Good",May,R93NPZBCLS608,3,"I am a graduate student at a Cal State University who constantly needs to be on a computer. I am a student of linguistics, so I need to have PRAAT software on my computer. I also need to have a compiler like Code::Blocks for the electives in computer science I took. I need to have everything backed up multiple times: in the cloud, on the hard-drive, and on an external hard drive, as well. Can my Samsung Chromebook do all that? Not really.However, the Chromebook is super lightweight, it stays charged for far longer than all my laptops and tablets, it even gives the option of linking this Chromebook to my desktop pc (that is Chromeâ€™s remote access and it is available on the Chromebook already, but you will need to download remote access to your second device in order to connect)! It does have the basics for me: google docs (like word), google slides (like powerpoint), google sheets (like excel) and google photos. It also has shortcuts to youtube, which I have found to be convenient.I use it mainly for writing, reading emails, and combing through the libraryâ€™s academic journal databases. If I was allowed to install software, I would have more programs running on this than there is right now. As is, I cannot install PRAAT, nor Code::Blocks, which is frustrating. Now, when I need to write code or record audio files, I bring my other Samsung laptop, the Samsung series 7 gamer, orange laptop. I hate doing this. I donâ€™t like taking my gaming laptop outside of the house because it was expensive and it weighs a lot (and has a 17.3 inch screen). So, I have my everyday, minimalist Chromebook with me almost all the time and when I donâ€™t it is because I needed a specific program to run and Chromebook cannot run outside software. This is the Chromebookâ€™s achilles heel, and when I need something not so minimalist, I have to lug around my gaming laptop and leave the Chromebook at home.This works for me, mainly because I already own a collection of electronics and I have back-up computers lying around. If you are strapped for cash, however, and you need your Chromebook to allow programs like SPSS (statistics software) to be installed, I would recommend you look at another computer. I understand that outside software can have security problems, but that is the internet in general at the moment, and the fact that I cannot install software programs is the main reason for the 2 star deduction. I would love to give this Chromebook five stars! Sadly, the issue with the lack of available software programs deserves a 1 star deduction.The other star deduction is because google is attempting to recreate major applications in their own style (i.e. Google sheets versus Microsoft Word and Secure Shell app for Code::Blocks). This counts as a star deduction because I then had to spend a prolonged period of time researching which google app equivalent I needed, hunt it down, add it, and then learn how it works. For example, Code:Blocks is straightforward. Secure Shell (which I used in my introduction to programming class) is structured differently. At first, I spent about an hour reading through internet forums about how to write code in Chromebooks. I finally found Secure Shell, but by that time I was frustrated. I can only imagine what this would be like for someone who does not have backup computers.I guess what I am trying to say is that one must buy a Chromebook already prepared to learn new software applications, because you will. Also, it is a bit puzzling to find downloads. Everything opens up on the web and saves to the web. One has to fiddle with the control panel to save it offline.Here are the reasons for my three stars: superlight weight! Compact! Charge lasts a long time! No need for anti-virus! The Chromebookâ€™s minimalist approach can be seen as a positive for some people! As soon as I lift the lid up, my Chromebook powers up in seconds! Inexpensive! Everything saves to the Cloud! I recommend the Chromebook for anyone who needs something only for essential cloud-based tasks. It also seems like it would make a cheap alternative for students at Universities, especially if their campus is like mine and spends quite a bit of money enticing students to walk in and buy a macbook...To sum up, the Chromebook is a minimalistic computer that works better than great for basic tasks but is below par when it comes to ease of use (because of all the googling I had to do to find the equivalent of Code:Blocks and Audacity) and functionality.One last note, I tried connecting a classroom projector to my Chromebook in order to show a powerpoint presentation, all to no avail. The Chromebook projected only the wallpaper on my screen (a picture of a fox), and completely ignored the google slides presentation that was clearly visible on the computer screen. I never did learn how to make that work.","May 1, 2014",

Anyway, first email said I needed to mail it back to Asus in California but it didn't include a shipping label. I tried to reply to the email (it's not as easy as hitting reply bec you have to use their website to reply) but it was down that day - servers were busy. The second day, same thing. So I tried an online agent. I waited over 2 hours but none came online. Same thing the third day, servers busy and no online agent. Fourth day, I got to email them, response was the next day.I researched online and found a repair center near me. I emailed them again to see if I can just walk it in. They said that's not possible for this unit because only the CA center has all the necessary parts and equipment. As I was filling out the email to ask this question I called them and asked a phone agent. That phone agent said, after checking with his supervisor, that it was OK to walk the unit in for repair! I didn't know who to believe at this point so I emailed them back. Their response was, here's their phone number - call them and ask yourself.Needless to say, I already wasted enough time with the email/ phone shenanigans and returned the defective unit to Amazon. I received the replacement unit from Amazon within two days with no issues!Second unit arrived and it looks like it's a refurbished unit.

The driver said it was up to date but a quick check on Intel's website said otherwise. I downloaded the driver update and BOOM. Problem fixed.Now, the graphics card is a new thing for me. I set it so that the Nvidia would be the primary but when I run the Benchmark on the JustCause2 game, it says the Intel 4000 card is being used. I can't seem to switch it from that. It even says on the tray that Nvdia is being utilized by the game but Benchmark results says otherwise.","December 16, 2012",

laptops,"Great laptop on paper, poor build quality, ASUS unhelpful",Chris Rodgers,R1BURQHXX081M4,3,"First the good: this laptop completely delivers on the specifications. I bought this for work (programming, data analysis, Adobe Illustrator) and it gets the job done. A beautiful screen with a great 1920x1080 resolution, which can actually display a nice chunk of a webpage, unlike the standard 1366x768. The i7 processor is incredibly fast and rivals the desktop that I built for computational work just a few years ago. The battery life is not great, but this is normal for a laptop with this much power. The extra video card (GT-630M) seems fine. I was pleasantly surprised to find that Ubuntu works pretty great out of the box with this hardware; you definitely need Bumblebee drivers to manage the 630M or it will suck up too much power.Now the negative: ASUS really dropped the ball on build quality. Lots of people are reporting the same problems. I had three:1) Stuck F10 key2) Rattling sound from one of the speakers during movies and music. Not enough to be obvious but enough to be slightly annoying.3) Touch pad sticks up a bit above the bezel.It just feels like shoddy workmanship. The speaker thing is especially annoying since the body of the laptop has an advertisement for the manufacturer of the speakers (Bang and Olufsen) etched permanently onto it. Even Microsoft is satisfied with a peel-away sticker!Even worse is that ASUS is really unhelpful. Tech support gave me an RMA, but I still had to package up the laptop and mail it to them, which costs $20 (including insurance; no way am I dropping a $1000 laptop in the mail without it). I very clearly described the 3 problems, both over the phone and on the form. It came back with only one thing fixed (the F10 key) and the other two problems exactly the same. It wasn't clear if they tried to fix it and failed, or just didn't try.I call again, and they want me to send it back again. No way am I going through that process again after you mess up the first time! At least they offered to pay for shipping the second time, although only after I requested it.Amazon was incredibly helpful with all of this. They offered either a full refund, or a free replacement. They even offered to send the replacement before receiving the old one, so that I wouldn't have to go without it for even a day. I think they've had enough complaints from enough people that they've stopped listing this item now.In the end I kept the original laptop. Despite all of its quirks, I really grew attached to it, and it's still a great laptop where it counts. It's just annoying that Asus wanted to cut corners and drag their feet.","March 5, 2013",
laptops,When you exchange laptop for a different one is it refurbished?,gina,R2QQ06R2SCMIZ9,3,"I have had to return this laptop three times already my first one was okay shipped from las vegas but the windows was erased even the back up on accident and it would not reboot after a while atleast thats what i think happened or was a hard drive defect.Then for some reason i dont know if all returns are shipped back used items or refurbished or something but the track pads were stuck down when i would press it down and i noticed manufactured date was a little older and so wwas serial number compared to the first on i recieved. Not only were the mouse pads defective but i also noticed the 2nd laptop charger was over sized and would not fit properly into the laptop when charging it also died quicker without charge for some reason.The third laptop return i got which im using now still has the track pad a little stuck but i'm getting tired of returning this laptop over and over again. But i noticed this charger lights up blue instead of green like the other ones i got .So my question is why are all the laptops i get n56vm exchanged always something is fishy or different im not sure if they are refurbished or returned from my observations of the constant improper quality check of the laptops.From other reviews it seems i am not the only one also, but is that why this laptop was lowered in cost? its refurbished or defected ? Because is that not illegal? They have not disclosed such information to customers so that would be attempting to sell a used product as new , cheating the customer.Good components but crapware and lack of quality check in hardware and track pad functionality is very irritating . very very annoyed. Asus makes good mother boards for desktops by the way one i had bought from asus motherboard for desktop had hollow capacitors which blew up , i hope this isn't a repeat of Asus taking short cuts using cheap parts so that breaks fast because no quality just cheap china made parts which breaks in a year or so. conviently which is when warranty is expired.Amazon however has atleast been great with letting me exchange the laptop great customer support and service one day shipping because of same shipping as purchased for returns is greatly appreciatedAsus however needs to either do a recall or compensate the headaches to its sellers like poor Amazon and its customers!!!","October 4, 2012",

But, of course, there's a catch, here--the keyboard, in my opinion, is terrible. Oh, it's functional enough, and backlit. The problem is that when you press down on some keys you'll hear a rather unsettling noise, like that of a very small plastic piece breaking. This is not consistent throughout the keyboard's keys and I don't want to hear ""that's supposed to happen"" or whatever. The point is that the noise made me think that something was broken in there or about to be, and it was very distracting.

I've not run any serious games and probably never will, but on a regular basis, I might have several large Excel files open, one or two Word files, a PDF or two, Outlook, Chrome with twenty or thirty windows open, ACDSee 6, iTunes, and maybe a card or other small game lurking in the background and this ASUS doesn't seem to know it's doing any work at all. I love it.- The screen is beautiful. Fully adjustable brightness from the keyboard and whole slew of display settings (thanks to NVIDIA software) make the display easy to adjust for any situation.- The keyboard is great. The product description calls it a ""tilt-up"" design. It's hard for me to pinpoint exactly what it is, but I find that this is perhaps the most comfortable notebook keyboard designs I've ever tried. The area where you rest your palms sits roughly a quarter inch higher than the level of the keyboard and the whole keyboard platform seems to slope gently upward. The back-lit adjustable brightness of the keyboard comes in very handy when watching TV with the wife in a darkened room while typing Amazon product reviews.- Four USB 3.0 ports as well as a Thunderbolt port offer a variety of high speed connectionsCons:- This notebook is huge. So huge in fact that it's difficult to find a case that will hold it. The power adapter is literally close to the size of a brick. I'm not gigging the star rating for this fact, but it's something that perspective buyers should be aware of. I bought the Targus Drifter II Backpack Designed for 17-Inch Laptop TSB239US (Black/Gray) and the computer won't quite fit in the intended padded and strapped pocket, but will comfortably fit in the slightly less protected main backpack compartment.- My computer has something rattling around inside it. I noticed it when my Targus backpack arrived a few days after my computer and I unplugged it and picked it up to see if I could fit it into my new case. There was a definite rattle inside the computer case that sounds to me like a screw rolling around. I removed the battery, RAM & fan covers and tilted the case around and could hear the object moving all the way from one side of the computer to another, but never did get it to shake out. I'm gigging the star rating one star for this. I'm sure that this isn't a common occurrence, and maybe it will never cause computer failure, but I can't help wondering if that little screw might not land on something and cause a short some day.All in all, this is a great computer for my purposes. If it weren't for the rattle, I'd give it 4.5 stars (if that were possible). If this thing lasts three or four years I'll be a very happy guy.","January 25, 2013",
laptops,Graphics subpar,Mo,R1HX7MO00S7LHX,3,"Bought the Best Buy version of this recently for Diablo 3. I already have a desktop with GTX 460 and i5-2500k, so I wanted something that could play with reasonable framerates and have portability.Even with resolution turned down and effects to low, dungeons on solo were choppy -- not talking just low framerate, but skipping (and not due to latency).

laptops,Just Ok,"koen ""koen""",RWX0YH0HTOWVM,3,"This is an all-around solid PC that is tough as nails. I bought it for my wife for Christmas and she is very hard on computers. She's had it for about one year and we have never had a single problem with it. It starts up relatively quickly, had been dropped and banged around more than once and it always starts on the first try. We have not had to reboot it or contact customer service at all. Granted, we run Norton Anti-Virus on it but that's the price you pay for a Windows machine. Personally, I would never buy another Windows machine, but if you're going to the Asus is a fine option. In fact, unlike this computer, Dells and HPs that I have owned had more problems than in one year than this one has had. I would buy an Asus again if I were going to buy a PC, which I'm not, because Macs are superior to all PCs irrespective of the manufacturer. Also, I'd note that this one has a great battery life and runs a lot cooler than older laptops I've owned. The only drawback on this PC is that the volume/speakers is really low. Perhaps I'm doing something wrong but the speakers seem very weak.UPDATE:It's been a few days over a year since I bought this, a few days past the Asus warranty, and the computer totally crashed and is stuck on the Windows welcome screen. I do not know if this is the software or the hardware, however, doing some research on Google showed that other Asus owners have experienced the same thing. And of course, it is not covered by the ""Square Trade"" warranty I bought. I bought the Asus because my friend had good luck with an Acer so I thought I'd get the same results with another Asian branded PC. However, I wouldn't buy another Asus at this point.","November 19, 2013",

laptops,Fine for the price/value - but mouse and number pad are annoying,Rich Y.,RGZZDG1XGSU5W,3,"Powerful laptop and performance is great for the price. Two annoyances though now that I've had this for over 3 months. The mouse is a little finicky and I'm not sure if this is tied to windows 8 (is there a special swipe gesture on the touch pad that causes switching back and forth between open windows????), as certain movements on the touch pad cause the screen to switch to another window. Second is the physical hardware of the number pad - it is just awkwardly placed and quite frankly I'm not sure why a laptop has a number pad. It takes up a lot of space and causes a lot of mistyping. As far as Windows 8 goes, it is actually a pretty slick user interface, but there are simply not enough apps to make it interesting. You can always fall back on ""desktop mode"" which is like Windows 7/VIsta if you don't particularly care for it.","March 19, 2013",

Perfect for internet use and homework for the average student. This laptop would be great for the the every day person surfing the net or managing a household as well. We paid $299.00 for it as a lightning deal and were very skeptical considering the low price. However....If it holds up to a kids abuse for over a month with no issues it deserves 5 stars!

But money being what it is (usually in short supply) we opted for this ASUS laptop. The delivery from Amazon was quick, and the computer arrived on our doorstep in a few days. An interesting way to shop for a computer! Setup was very easy, and the laptop has functioned very well.A few complaints: less than a month after delivery, the Tab and Caps Lock keys came off! Looking at the surprisingly complex, interlocking parts under the keys, it seems that a couple of tiny pins had broken. We aren't sure whether this happened in manufacturing, or delivery or from (very gentle) home use. After consulting with an online guide for replacing keys (and after 3 hours of sweating over the tiny pieces) I got one key back on completely and the other back on most of the way. The device is workable, but I suspect that I will eventually have to replace the two keys completely.Note that the ASUS laptop is bare bones. It comes with a power supply, but not a mouse.We got what we paid for: an inexpensive working laptop, with a few flaws, that functions well (after one month, cross fingers!) as an in-home computer.","January 22, 2013",

We bought the Win7 version, so I cannot comment on the Win8 level of comfort.The biggest issue is the battery life which is miserable - 2 hours at best.

laptops,UPDATED: Christmas Eve Disappointment,M. Quinones,R32VJ2JTLNXWD5,3,"THIS IS AN UPDATE TO MY EARLIER REVIEW BELOW:We tried connecting the laptop to another WIFI connection in a friend's home and it worked. Then we also tried connecting with ethernet at home. It worked. So we determined the problem HAD to be our internet/cable company. We called Comcast and they connected remotely to the laptop and changed some settings ON THE COMPUTER which allowed the laptop to recognize and connect to my home network. Problem is solved.....so we are keeping the laptop. But I can't give it more than 3 stars because I'm not personally using the laptop. I'm sticking with my MacBook Pro! :o)**********After researching laptops for my teenager (and reading several outstanding reviews), I decided on this notebook as a Christmas present for my son so he would have his own and stop using my MacBook pro. He opened it and we started to set it up but there was an issue with connectivity to our WIFI. It kept saying that it was connected to my home network but then also said, ""no internet access"". After several reboots, troubleshooting attempts, resetting modem, etc., I finally called support and was surprised to find someone to help me on Christmas Eve. We spent 1 1/2 hours on the phone troubleshooting and as a last resort setting the notebook back to its factory settings. Nothing. Could not figure out the problem, especially since my MacBook and other wireless devices in the home were connected with no issue. Needless to say, I'm frustrated and have decided to return the computer and find a different one. I even Googled the problem and it appeared that there were numerous forums about this very issue (connected, but ""no internet access"") and some seem to believe it is a Windows 7 issue? When I mentioned the many forums to the tech on the phone, he stated that I was the first person he heard of to have this issue. I guess that's why he couldn't help me further.Oh well. Back to the factory and back to Square One. Spending 1 1/2 hours on the phone on Christmas Eve was enough for me to be completely turned off by this 'supposedly great brand'....and now I have to go back to sharing my laptop until I find another one. Arrrrrgh.The real bummer is that I bought it a week ago and it's been sitting under the tree since then. I should have opened it and tried setting up to make sure everything worked, then re-boxed and wrapped it. I could have discovered this problem earlier and possibly still had a laptop for my son in time for Christmas.","December 24, 2012",
laptops,A big step down from smartphones and laptops,"radial75 ""R.A.D.""",RTN8HH7U7JTGB,3,"Here's my personal opinion; I've owned my Chromebook since September and use it for school. Web surfing, accessing online courses and creating & sharing Google Docs.Pros:Chrome browser, Google platform work well with my preexisting Samsung Galaxy Note II. I've been an Android user since 2009.Keyboard is responsive and good quality keys.PriceWebcam - a nice feature for such an affordable device.Lightweight and compactCons:Speed. It lags quite a bit in download speed compared to my Galaxy and my Mac Mini. This is annoying when I'm trying to get work done on the web, which is the whole point of this device. It's not what I expected from Samsung. I'm wondering whether, like my phone, it would speed up if I installed an SD card.Display. It looks washed out to me- poor contrast and not crisp. For all I can tell, the only adjustment that can be made is in the Advanced Settings, under 'Accessibility' you can change it to contrast mode, which becomes a black background with light text. I use this when I create documents because it's truly easier for me to see, but online it's a pain because photos look like negatives. I don't have any vision problems, it's just a cheap looking screen.Touchpad is awkward for me. The click function works with a very light touch, or a heavy push on the pad. Many times I've clicked a link without intending to when I lift my hand to turn a page or something, then go back to the trackpad. Perhaps I could adjust this, I haven't tried.Web browser is limited- I think due to lack of ability to install things like Java and Adobe Flash Player. I notice it when I try to play certain videos online- it just doesn't work, tries to download them instead, but still won't open and play.This is just one person's opinion, but a warning that this device is pretty limited. Great price, but I'm a little disappointed and find myself not using it as much as I thought. Why would I, when my Galaxy Note II is so much faster and can do more? The only advantage this has for me is a keyboard, on which I can work much faster than a touch screen.Thanks for reading and good luck!","November 20, 2013",

laptops,"Samsung Netbook Awesome, Chrome OS... Not So Much",K. White,R236ZCLY58TMS2,3,"Because I'm really reviewing too different products, the physical Samsung netbook and the Chrome OS, I'll separate my review.Samsung NetbookPros- Keyboard is big enough for even large hands.- Netbook is thin, light weight- Battery life is around 7-9 hours, depending on use- Screen is large enough for most work, but small enough to be portable- Contains a decent webcam- Excellent price - you can't beat $249.00Cons- Only two USB ports- No old-fashioned monitor ports, so I can't connect this netbook to most projectors at my school- Keyboard sometimes strains my small hands because it's almost too large- No delete key (backspace sometimes works for this)- No capslock keyChrome OSPros- Instant boot, which is really quite awesome- Very little to no bloatware- East to use, no setup- The Play Store has a lot of really innovative apps that can make one's life easierCons(where do I even start?)- No Dropbox integrationLet me explain what I mean by this. Yes, I can pin the dropbox WEBSITE to the taskbar and instant it easily (kind of like an easily accessible bookmark), but using it on this laptop is difficult and tedious. To get a file from dropbox, I must download it, which downloads to my computer's hard drive. Then, I have to upload it into Drive. If I try to open it right away, however, I can't edit. It opens it into a Viewer app which is the most unhelpful and irritating app on this device. So, I must open it manually into the Sheets app, which will let me edit. Then, after editing, I have to download the file as a proper .xls/.doc/.ppt to my computer's hard drive. This inevitably changes the file name, which I then have to manually rename so that it will replace the original file when I upload it to dropbox. Then, go back to the dropbox site and upload it, and it then syncs with my other devices. And of course the formatting is changed, so when I open it elsewhere, I either have to deal with ugly formatting or change it before I can use the document.Yes, I could use Drive, but this brings me to the next annoying part of Chrome OS:- Every file must be changed to Google's native file types before they can be added to Drive or used in any wayThis just adds another unnecessary step to everything, whether I want to upload to Dropbox or send the file to someone else.- Google Office apps are just inferiorThey are difficult to use, they unnecessarily have different file extensions that must be changed to use with Microsoft Office programs, and the formatting never looks as nice. There are also fewer options.- Every app requires internet connectivity to work fullyFor some reason, Google decided it would be a great idea to limit the functionality of its apps if the computer isn't connected to the internet. This means that if I'm making a slideshow online, I can't add a picture to my slides whatsoever. Even though I made to sure to add the image files to my computer the night before so that I could make the slideshow while I was at work where I am not lucky enough to have internet. Why? It makes no sense whatsoever.So, in summary, that's why I gave this review three stars. I'm very impressed with the Samsung netbook, but not very impressed with the Chrome OS. I'm currently looking into trying to have the option to boot to Ubuntu as well, because Chrome OS unnecessarily limits my productivity and creates unnecessary barriers to smooth operations I performs everyday.","September 23, 2013",

laptops,If you like Google Apps this is the perfect gadget,P. Wolfson,R286IT5P9QWCKK,3,"Revised review 4 months later. Chromebook will not boot with powerpack connected, just get a screen with no backlight. Ordered 3 of these. 1 100% failure, 1 with bad ""5"" key, one works fine. No real complaints about ChromeO/S now that Netflix works. If you use the shell for ssh connections, there is no X-forwarding, which is irritating. Chrome's Remote Desktop is wonderful, but you have to install it on each computer it is used on. Worth the effort. RDP emulators don't seem to be supported on this Samsung version. This is mainly a poke at Samsung, not Google. Since I use Google Apps, this device is impressive and effective. Would purchase again, but 2 of 3 full/partial failures remind me of several defunct PC manufacturers.Original review:Warts and all, I am much happier carrying 2.5 lbs rather than 10. I use it with a very inexpensive 23"" LED screen attached. All things considered, my office computer is a Windows 8 Ferrari but life is significantly easier working on a Fiat 500 90% of the time.I've heard lots of complaints that a Chromebook is a browser with a keyboard attached. It is, but that begs the question of cloud computing. If you need to use it on while traveling, a wireless internet connection is mandatory - you can only do so much working on documents stored on a USB stick.If you want a cheap Windows or Mac clone, do not buy this product, Chrome-OS is dependent on keyboard shortcuts which are unique to Chrome and they take a bit of getting used to. Ctrl-Alt-? launches an overwhelming array of shortcuts, my advice is to ignore them. Learn no more than what you need.App are plentiful, but for work,you get a limited but functional office suite, fast email, Google drive and broad compatibility with Microsoft cloud services. Chrome Remote Desktop is awesome. If you need Netflix, then wait until that App is fixed, this particular Chromebook has problems with it - they are working on it.It's cheap, very fast, and very secure.

It features a solid body construction with a nice keyboard and trackpad.As a power user who has lots of apps and extensions installed, I experienced issues running out of available RAM which results in the constant reloading of tabs. There wasn't enough system memory available to run all of my extensions and tabs. This resulted in slow performance.The second issue I experienced is that the 303 is essentially incompatible with any LCD projector as it does not support changing the resolution from its native 1366 x 768 setting. Unless your external display can handle this resolution (Most projectors can not, but some TV can), you will not be able to project. Because I travel and present a lot, being able to connect to external displays was very important to me.After several weeks of testing I returned my Samsung 303 for the speedier (and pricier) Samsung 550 which has resolved all of the above issue.The 303 is a great device for students and casual web browsers but should not be recommended for power users.","May 23, 2013",

It does have good qualities.. But the first week I got it, it seemed to have a random sound effect. I'd be listening to a video, and it would randomly mute. Easy fix is that I just close out the pages and restart what I was doing.Also, when it gets a little too hot (for lack of paying attention) it will shut down immediately. Typically, there is some sort of warning on such. And, yes... it's my fault. I need to get a cooling pad, and a desk would be a good idea. But the warnings of overheating are nice.You can't use Java, so that stinks.Sometimes the mouse locks up really bad.

A huge bonus is not having to concern myself with updates, patches, anti-virus software, or even software installation. Off-line functionality is getting better, and all indications are that Google intends to improve in that area.Two weaknesses are: 1.) Not having full, Windows-like functionality for all-in-one printers (and CloudPrint in general), and 2.) No Delete key (which may or may not bother you).As a technical writer, I'm used to my keyboard layout. I can deal with no Caps Lock key, but I need my Delete key. Not including one makes no sense. It doesn't quite smack of Microsoft's arrogance with regard to Windows 8, but the ""Google knows best"" attitude can take a hike. I've gotten enough of that attitude from the other two major players. I can safely say that -I'm- the only one who best understands my computing needs.The unit itself is zippy and easy to set up and customize. When the second-generation Chromebook Pixel with Intel's Haswell processor hits the streets, I intend to buy one--but only if the keyboard sports a Delete key.","July 10, 2013",
laptops,"Very good aspects, bad aspects too.",MacEducator,R1NLS67MST8PV3,3,"As there was a long wait, it took about a month to receive from the time of order. I provide tech training services and wanted to add Chrome OS to my repertoire of services offered.Received the Chromebook and setup was a breeze. Imported my bookmarks, made configurations. The display was exceptional -- bright, glare free and easy to read. Build quality was very good for the price. Keyboard and trackpad were nearly Apple quality. I used and enjoyed the Chromebook for 3 days and then there was an auto update and everything went to hell. Wifi would connect and drop within a few seconds, then the process would repeat continually. Contacted support which took 3 days for a response (too long). Response was that they were aware of the issue and there was no timeframe for resolution, so back it goes for refund.The unit itself was very good, and the cloud computing system of Chrome OS offered good functionality. However, the update wifi issue, and time it took Google support to respond, lead me to believe it is not ready for wide use and I could not, in good conscience, recommend this system to my clients.I will try a Chromebook again in 6-12 months to see if the system has developed to solid reliability.","February 24, 2013",
laptops,Terrible with photos,"JCK - retireandgo ""retireandgo""",R1L7866ZPILU0V,3,"I bought this last December for a trip to Thailand and Cambodia. It's light, inexpensive and takes SD cards. However, it wasn't long before the computer would balk and stop with a lame excuse from Google/Samsung: ""Snap, something went wrong (paraphrase)"".It got to the point where I could only load 20 or so pictures at a time, instead of inserting the SD card and copying all of them. Also, the screen only shows 3 photos in a row and not very sharp. There is much room for improvement as far as using this computer to load photos and look at them.However, for Wi-Fi, email, etc. it is fine. The keyboard has a better feel than my MacBook Air!

laptops,Inconvenient if you have older camera/printer,"Gilrean Vroth ""Gilrean Vroth""",R5ZI5IBONGDWJ,3,"The Chromebook is fast and nice to work on however, I found a big glitch with mine. It doesn't recognize my older camera and I can't print from it. This is because both my camera and printer are a bit older--I think I purchased the Canon 8 megabit camera about 5 or 6 years ago. To access my pictures I have to take the SD card out and put it in the slot--using the USB plug does nothing. This is not convenient.The cloud printing doesn't work if,like me, your printer is 8-10 years old and isn't hooked into Wi-Fi. I am not about to buy a new one, so I have to use my PC laptop if I have things to print. This is also not convenient. If the printer ever breaks down, I'll get a cloud printer but I'm cheap and will wait.So, it is nice small etc. but it has its issues. If you have ""old"" stuff, like me,there can be problems. Further, it doesn't have right click so that can be a hassle if you've been using a PC. I still can't get spell check to work.The good thing is you can go to the Chrome Forum and ask lots of questions and Google people will help. They are very helpful and patient and get back to your right away.","December 26, 2013",

Unfortunately, I could not listen to my live lectures on it. I could access homework assignments, web searches, and Discussion Boards for classes and reply on the discussion board's. This thing loads up so fast it will make your head spin! For the person that is not very savvy with computers, it is relatively easy to navigate. I did have issues with downloading some google aps, kept getting the ""your device is not found"" error. I am sure there are ways of getting those aps, but I was not successful.

laptops,First entry into ChromeOS is slightly muddled by hardware,Derek Danahy,RAWOG532TTCSW,3,"I've been using this laptop for work and recreation for over a year now. Initially, I loved it, and after a year I still like it but my particular machine (and most likely many others) has problems.Firstly, when opening the laptop lid with the charger plugged in will always result on a black screen. This is fixed by removing the charger, shutting the lid, and then re-opening the lid. It's a minor inconvenience but it is still a gripe.Secondly, after about 14 months of owning the product the screen is starting to get fuzzy. This again is easily fixed by changing the angle of the monitor until the fuzzy screen disappears. A minor complaint but still something that often gets in the way.The chromebook landscape is (thankfully) a very fluid hardware market and at this point I would recommend to buy another chromebook elsewhere. After a year of using ChromeOS I'm excited at the prospect of buying another chromebook, however, I'm still waiting until this one dies. It is unfortunate to think that it shouldn't be too much longer until this one kicks the bucket.In summation: This was an adequate device when this was first released.

An issue I've long since resolved. However, I just finished writing a 15 page paper and two 4 page papers for a couple of submissions that took me a really long time and are due in a couple of hours from now. So, since saving is not an option offline, at least not with my limited understanding of this damned device, I closed up shop and decided to come back to my room to upload my papers. Turns out my chromebook decided to restart of its own free will and my papers no longer exist. I officially hate Chromebook.

laptops,OK! Living in the clouds is possible just not sure the right option for me ... yet.,"Samuel J ""iNetSynch""",R2BZR4DVIDU6LF,3,"For the last several months, my Toshiba Satellite laptop keyboard has been malfunctioning and I had begun searching for a replacement. I had hoped to find the perfect hybrid Windows 8 tablet but was sidetracked when I read page after page of positive Chromebook reviews. I purchased my Samsung Chromebook at the local Best Buy fully expecting to be wowed and to quickly fall in love with it.After two days of working with it, I wouldn't say that I'm in love with it nor could I say that the concept of using a glorified browser and cloud services seems as preposterous as I had once imagined. As many have noted, the good keyboard, respectable build quality and lightweight make a positive first impression. The track pad makes a less favorable impression.I discovered after a great deal of frustration that it does not support two finger tap gestures. The Chromebook help screen claims that tapping with two fingers simulates a right click. I incorrectly assumed that Google docs did not support spelling suggestions. When I tried to right-click on misspelled words, nothing happened and I was almost ready to box it up and return it to Best Buy. After some searching on the Internet, I discovered that the Samsung Chromebook requires you hold down the Alt key while tapping to right-click. I often found myself wanting to reach out and touch the screen because scrolling is so tedious.(See update below for correction to this comment.)When compared with competing Chromebooks, the display leaves much to desire but as others have noted the matte finish compensates enough to save it from a deal killer rating. I have yet to get a handle on how much battery life to expect but it certainly exceeds the 2 -3 hours I get when using my Toshiba.Others have been impressed with the ""Instant On"" Chrome OS but as a Windows 8 user, I am less impressed. I've grown accustomed to my Windows 8 computers being available for use within seconds of switching them on. However, I am impressed by the quality of audio produced using the built in speakers. As with the display, the sound is a bit muddy but better than what I am accustomed to when using portable devices.A major disappointment is the lack of support for Bluetooth audio devices. I often use my LG Bluetooth headset to listen to streamed podcasts and music. Strangely, the LG device is displayed after it's been turned off but disappears when I turn it on and try to connect. None of my 4 Bluetooth audio headsets will work with the Samsung Chromebook. The lack of audio Bluetooth support is close to being a deal breaker. I recently purchased an analog to Bluetooth adapter and I suppose I can use it as a work around but that is certainly far from ideal. A second disappointment is lack of support for Netflix. I understand a fix is in the works but if not forthcoming within the 30 day returned period, I will return the Chromebook and continue my search for the perfect Windows 8 hybrid tablet / laptop.For me the jury is still out as to whether I will keep the device. I continue to bump into limitations that may be more peculiar to my usage habits than to the targeted audience for this device. Three prime examples are the lack of support for Skype, voice recognition, and Microsoft office suite. I had not used Google docs prior to purchasing the Chromebook and I am still trying to decide if I can use it is a portable replacement for my much-loved Microsoft alternatives.Bottom line: I am impressed with how functional the device is and suspect Chrome OS is here to stay and will negatively affect the bottom line of both Microsoft and Apple.The success of Android and now Chromebook OS go a long way to vindicate my Linux friends who have long predicted Linux on my desktop.Update: A. Dightam wrote to correct my claim that two finger tapping did not simulate a right click. He was right and after a bit of two finger tap, tap, tapping it works like a charm.I used my analog to Bluetooth adapter to connect to my favorite Bluetooth headset and it worked as expected. I have my fingers crossed native support for Bluetooth audio is in the works.I have tested two USB devices. My USB Xbox Vision webcam works with the camera app. Frame rate is disappointing but happy to see I have at least one alternative to the built-in camera. In anticipation of Netflix support, I connected my wireless Lenovo Multimedia Remote Keyboard and it worked flawlessly. Unlike Apple and Windows device installs, I saw no driver install message and both devices were usable within seconds of plugging into the USB socket. Sweet!Update #2:Have used HDMI out to stream Amazon movies to big screen TV and works like a charm. Still missing Netflix and Audio Blue Tooth support which could trigger my return of the unit if not forthcoming. I use a BT transmitter to pair with BT headsets but that is becoming tiresome. I am getting used to Google Docs and, given my limited laptop demands re. word processing and spreadsheet data entry, Google docs is all that is needed when using the Chromebook. The matte screen continues to impress me. Would be hard to take it back but I really depend on Bluetooth audio. I have another 10 days to decide if I am willing to wait and trust Google / Samsung to make it happen.Expiration Date Update:I happily allowed the window for returning my Chromebook expire. After trying three different Atom based Windows 8 hybrid tablet / laptop machines I settled on an Asus RT and docking keyboard. This geek never expected to purchase and use, much less like, a Windows RT device but stranger things have happened to me. Although I love the Win RT machine, I am almost equally fond of the Chromebook.The size, weight, good battery life,lovely screen, great keyboard and NO FUSS operating system made it a keeper. I am even growing fond of Google docs. The Asus Windows RT makes for a sweet tablet and I feel as secure using it as I do the Chromebook but it is not the laptop replacement I sought. As long as my portable demands remain as limited as they are now, the Chromebook makes for an excellent laptop experience.I miss Netflix, Skype, audio Bluetooth and if the price had not been so low and the Asus RT so good at filling in for these missing bits, I would have returned the Chromebook. At $200 - $250 it makes sense ... anything above that would take it a non starter for me.I changed the rating from 2 to 3 stars. Missing too many bits to warrant 4.UPDATE!!!As of March 11, 2013 Netflix is supported! BRAVO! Now for audio Bluetooth and Skype! Sweet!BRAVO: Bluetooth audio now works!!!","January 31, 2013",
laptops,Tablet w/ a keypad......Chromebook still finding its way,Christina L. Howard,R2UPPKJ9ONFXDQ,3,"Full disclosure, I've packaged the unit back and have printed the return docs - this Chromebook is going back.Don't get me wrong - it's pretty cool - but there's a few things in play which I failed to get past. Consider the following down sides, from my perspective.Generationally speaking, I have a full grasp of PCs & laptops and their potential for storing items in the machine........the idea of 'the cloud' is not new to me, but one I'm not able, or willing to fully accept.............consider that upon purchaseI was also unable to mentally grasp the 'Big Brother' angle in terms of Google being Omni-present - I suppose the idea of them taking over the world is acceptable, but for now, let's keep some 'local ' controlFairly limited in terms of ports - a single 2.0 USB and a single 3.0 USB (which was a bit stubborn in accepting any hardware) and an HDMI..............which if you've seen in multiple forums, simply has issues in terms of connectivity with TVs and external monitors - I lost track of all the nonsense with this issue. One of the primary reason in trying this unit was to view Netflix on my TV - I was never able to connect and in turn spent hours searching for solutions, to no avail. Consider this factor carefully.....Yes, it updates and virus can be kept at bay; it starts up lightning quick and has the potential to a nice middle ground between an Apple and or Windows based machine, but for all intents and purposes, it's a tablet w/ a keypad......not entirely practical.Considering it's price & features, if you have a tablet, dig in and see what it can do - they are pretty powerful, some as with mine, run Polaris - a Windows Office suite - which cannot be housed on the Chromebooks. A couple hundred bucks more gets a user into real storage space that's local, can run Office and do those things you 'grew up' doing.Maybe someday the Chrome OS will be more legit - they certainly have an idea of what they want to do, but I'm not sure they are all in at this stage of the game.","April 27, 2014",

laptops,"Could have been so good, but ...",Jeanette D Peppers,R3FLVN0E4O6ECI,3,"This could have been a nice notebook, but it fell short in so many ways. To start with, it has a polished screen, not a matte screen. I already have a polished screen laptop, and it reflects everything. However, a Green Onion screen guard solved that problem. Of course, that was more money. The next problem was that it came with Windows 8. About that, all I have to say is, ""What was Microsoft thinking?"" This thing is a bigger turkey than Windows ME, and a lot worse than Vista. I continually had problems with various controls being activated when I didn't want them to, and never could figure out why they happened. I am no novice, but a computer professional, and a fairly early adopter of new technology. Win8 might be OK for tablets, but Microsoft seems to have turned their backs on the business market. Fortunately, I have access to Windows 7 to put on it, so I fixed that problem, too. I replaced the hard drive with an SSD, and the computer screams now. I still find the track pad unacceptable. The entire track pad surface, including the buttons, are active. Every time I go to click a button, I put my thumb on it, and the mouse moves. It's neat looking, but not very effective. I don't think that there is any fix for this problem. Some reviewers said to go to Synaptics and download their drivers, but my computer doesn't have a Synaptics pad. It is a different manufacturer. There are a lot of features that I like, but these drawbacks are enough to lower the rating to just three stars. I may be a little generous with that.","December 9, 2012",

It was regular priced at $599, so I just had to buy even though my other computer is perfectly fine. I would not recommend this computer if it were actually priced over $500. The mouse pad is way too sensitive. The webpage I am on will disappear if my thumb even touches the pad sometimes. The main menu always pops up. Its stupid, I don't even know why there is that apps menu. The desktop setting should be the main setting, not a bunch of apps. This is not a tablet or iphone, so whats up with all the apps? The screen does have good clear picture for movies and tvshows etc. The sound sucks because the speakers are on the bottom of the computer.

The speakers are not that big of a deal though because I use HDMI cable to hook up to my TV to get better sound. DO NOT spend more than $500 for this computer.

laptops,"Exactly what I wanted in a mobile laptop/tablet combo, but ended up returning",Steve Crossland,R3CP4DAM13MURR,3,"I purchased two of these units for my wife and me from Staples a few days ago. We've both run them through enough of our routine work tasks that I can say I am officially in love. My rating is really a 4.5, but I choose to round up instead of down because, for me, the benefits outweigh the shortcomings.My wife and I are both Realtors with iPhones and we work full time off our two laptops from a home office. We are very mobile, meeting clients mostly in the field, at coffee shops, or at their homes, but do spend a lot of time at a desk, working in ""desktop"" mode. She's been bugging me for over a year to get an iPad. I've resisted because I don't view the iPad as a solution to any of our productivity issues, and I didn't want each of us to have a third device to deal with. Instead, I have been patiently waiting for the right Ultrabook, and the Thinkpad Twist is it.Is it big enough to work on full time?When we downsized from full PCs to fulltime 15.6 Laptops 3+ years ago, I was very worried about adapting to the smaller size keyboards and screens. It worked out just fine, but I have the same concern going from 15.6 inch screens to 12.5 inch screens, especially as we're both in our 50s now and don't see as well.For both of us, the Twist passes the size test, no problem. I can see just fine with the smaller screen. So can my wife. The keyboard is, surprisingly, actually better for me than the bigger laptop keyboard or even a full size desktop keyboard. I basically type with two finger (each hand) plus thumbs. So I'm having no trouble at all. All the keys I normally need and use are located well. I tried out some of the Surface Tablets in the Microsfot store in Austin, and, to me, the keyboard provided on this ultrabook is so much better than the keyboards available with the Surface that I wouldn't even consider trying to work full time on anything less.How is the Touchpad and Button setup?In my normal work desk area, I use a mouse, so no issues there. I plugged in the small usb plug and it set itself up in a few seconds and the wireless mouse was working, just like that. Easy. (As an aside, i've had no connectivity issues with my wireless printer, WiFi, Home network, Public WiFi either. Everything has connected seamlessly with no problem at all)However, as I type this in my favorite coffee shop, without a mouse, I'm still adapting to the touchpad and, specifically, the darned gestures that Windows 8 thinks I'm making, which constantly changes the screen to another app. I had no idea that I lightly graze the touchpad with my thumbs so often when typing, but I do, and I'll have to learn to stop that. Meanwhile, in the settings, I've told Windows to not change screens with ""swipe from left"". Instead, it now pops up a small left-side column of recently used apps, which is still annoying but not disruptive. I simply swipe from left again to close it, then carry on.The other bit of training I'm having to learn is the actual speed of motion when moving the mouse. Sometimes, when just moving the mouse left, it thinks it's a swipe because I moved too fast. I feel that I will continue to learn and adapt to the sensitivities of the machine and Windows 8.The other non-mouse issue is the buttons and clicking. I haven't used the red pointer at all, other than out of curiosity. Nor the pointer buttons at the top of the pad. Both the bottom left and right of the touchpad itself depress and act as ""right click"" and ""left click"". I find it easy enough to do this because this is where the buttons were located on my old laptop anyway. It's also easy enough to click and drag when dragging and dropping files from one folder to another, or when dragging windows to one side or the other to set up split screen view of two different windows.Finally, my wife hasn't experienced one single instance of the ""accidental swipes"" changing her screen. She's oblivious to what I'm even talking about when I ask her. She uses all fingers to type and her thumbs don't flop around the touchpad like mine, and I guess she uses kinder, gentler movements of the mouse. So, this issue will vary from user to use I feel.Does it get too Hot?I read some reviews complaining about the heat so I'll address that quickly. Running side by side next to my old Dell Studio 15 laptop, the two systems produce exactly the same amount of heat. I don't think the ThinkPad produces too much heat, and I wouldn't have thought to even mention it had I not read about it in so many other reviews. In tablet mode, yes, I can feel that it's hotter in one area in back than the other, but no more so than my daughter's iPad that her school provides, which I held for comparison. To me, this isn't an issue.How is it in Tablet Mode?I spent a couple of hours yesterday in tablet mode. This is actually my first Tablet, so I have nothing to compare it to (oter than iPhone). And I spend more time producing than consuming content on my computer, but I really enjoyed reading news, swiping through articles, etc. I don't play games so I didn't try any of those and can't comment about that.The system was responsive and quick. The screen easy to read (though it randomly dims temporarily every now and then), and I found it easy to learn the gestures and movements needed to navigate through apps and content. It was especially wonderful watching sports news videos. I tried an app where I could draw with my finger. Not my thing, but it seemed to work just fine for those who want to create/draw or annotate photos or documents in that manner.The real tablet-mode test will come later as my wife wants to replace paper printouts with pdf files of sales listings when showing properties. Many Realtors do this with iPads, and I imagine this will be accomplished on the Twist in tablet mode with a pdf app of some kind.How is the portablility?This is one of the things we will enjoy most. This computer is very small and thin. My wife can actually slip it into one of her larger purses instead of lugging the bigger, heavier laptops we had. We will be travelling for 5 days next week and will put them through the real life travel test then, but already I can tell this is going to be a very easy unit to carry around and work with, especially having WiFi hotspots built into our phones.Do Legacy Windows Programs Run OK?This is more of a W8 questions, but I do have two legacy desktop software applications that I need to run, which is another reason I ruled out an RT tablet, and they both run fine in desktop mode.Did you look at the Lenovo Yoga?Yes, but ruled it out because the hard drive is too small (way smaller usable hard drive space than the specs suggest) and the keys are exposed at bottom in laptop mode (though disabled). Also, the Twist can assume all 4 positions of the Yoga, so I personally saw a destinct advantage with the Twist. Finally, I wanted a business-oriented build and design, and the Thinkpad is built for business (though I think a home user might also find it a better entertainment machine as well).Overall, three days in, I'm very pleased. More importantly, my non-techie wife is very happy with hers as well. I'm especially pleased about having been patient and waited so long for the right combination of form factor and utility. This unit really hits the right note for me as a mobile professional. I never bought into the ""tablet only"" solution. Twist offers both a full fledge windows machine with real keyboard, and a useful tablet for uses better suited to a tablet factor. It has real posrts and connectivity to other hardware. It hits a real sweet spot for me. It's not ""too small"" as a 12.5"" laptop, and not ""too big"" as a 12.5"" tablet. Perfect!If I left anything out (which I'm sure I did), feel free to ask.EDIT: I've reduced my Review star score to 3 stars.After writing the initial review, different problems started showing up. For my wife, the best description would be ""Bloatware Gremlins"", constantly pestering and prompting her to click this, install that. She kept getting popups for all different things. I have no idea what she did but her IE started freezing up regularly and she started having intermittent issues. On our business trip, she ended up not able to use the computer, but used mine.For me, I guess I'm not as susceptible to the Bloatware Gremlins, and swat them away without thinking much about it, but I did eventually find the ""dripping"" out of these prompts and popups to be annoying. Also, my Lenovo Service Window box would remain open constantly and I couldn't get it to close. When I closed it, it would open right back up. I called support and they couldn't find the record of my warranty or registration, even though I could type it in at their website and it confirmed as being a registered computer under warranty. The trouble ticked was ""escalated"", yet I never heard back from anyone, and still haven't to this day.Finally, I was experiencing intermittent flickering of the screen in tablet mode. I'd have to turn off the unit and restart to get it to stop. And the screen would not rotate properly from landscape/portrait mode at times. Also, direct sunlight on the screen seemed to cause problems.I could probably have worked through the issues on mine eventually, but my wife and I always use identical computers in our business/usability, and she was unwilling to keep trying to deal with her unit. With the 14 day return window almost up, I decided to take them back. The lady at Staples said someone else had returned theirs that day also, with some sort of hard drive issue.","November 4, 2012",
laptops,Great laptop with a twist,Robert A. Schmidt,RYHESV5TZQQ19,3,"I purchased my Twist after looking at the Samsung Ativ Smart PC 500T. Both offer interesting approaches to the tablet/laptop hybrid at similar prices. I purchased my Lenovo on sale for $848 after tax, while the Samsung is $750 on Amazon. I decided on the Lenovo because A) it was available locally, and B) I wasn't sure if I wanted to lug around the keyboard dock on the Samsung, and it wasn't useable as a tablet with it attached. I have used HP elitebooks at work before so I knew how the Lenovo's hinge mechanism worked, and decided that was the better alternative for me. The Lenovo also offers the advantage in that it has a far more powerful Intel i5 CPU, while the 500T only comes with the Intel Atom Z2760. Both are dual cores at I believe 1.7GHz, and while I have not had a chance to use a device with this new atom I think it's safe to say the i5 is much more powerful (CPUBenchmark.net gives the i5 3317U a score of 3,211 vs 679 for the Atom Z2760. A side note, the 500T's big brother, the 700T, comes with the same i5 3317U CPU as the Lenovo Twist.This CPU is a huge advantage as it is pretty powerful for a laptop, but still runs very cool. I installed core temp and did the WEI benchmark, temps got to the mid 60's Celsius, but it never felt more than warm to touch. I'd had a Samsung Series 3 laptop with a i3 before, and in comparison that would get scalding hot compared to the Lenovo. Other components include an acceptable but loud 500GB @ 5400rpm hard drive, 4GB (upgradeable to a single 8GB slot) of DDR3 memory, and a 5 touch point screen that runs at a somewhat disappointing 1366x768 (720p). Windows 8 experience index is :6.9 for processor5.9 for Memory (RAM)4.4 for graphics (Intel HD4000)6.1 for gaming graphics5.9 for hard driveThe powerful CPU is definitely a plus, but to be honest the screen resolution is a little disappointing. The 700T offers full 1080p at 1980x1080 resolution. It'd be nice if the Lenovo at least offered 1600x900 as it is a ThinkPad which indicates its aimed towards business users. As mentioned before the hard drive is also a little loud, most of the time it isn't noticeable except when its frequently accessing the drive. A 128gb solid state drive (also used in the Samsung 700T) would be greatly appreciated and I can't imagine would add much cost, though I am sure some would prefer the larger space over speed/lower temps/quietier advantages of the SSD. In any case it's not too difficult to take out the old HDD and put an SSD in, same goes for upgrading the RAM to 8GB.The final complaint is in the screen, while it is responsive and works and looks nice it seems like it's a little underwhelming. For example, even the atom powered Samsung 500T offers the 10 point touch screen with wacom digitizer and stylus. Again, considering this is a business laptop, I think the Lenovo could benefit from this. Looking at the $300 premium of the 700T, maybe it's not worth the extra price to have an SSD, digitizer, and 1080p screen - but I doubt it'd really cost that much to add this hardware to the Twist. Afterall, the Samsung 700T is cramming all that PC hardware into the screen as the keyboard area is just an attachable dock, while Lenovo has the whole body to basically work around with. That said, I'm still happy with the Twist, I guess Lenovo just got me hooked and now I'll be buying the 1080p version with digitizer when it comes out.Edit: I noticed the IdeaPad Yoga solves most of the complaints I have about this Thinkpad, it has an SSD, higher res screen, not sure about if it's a 10 point or 5 point touch sensitive screen though. It's also quite a bit more expensive and I'm not sure I like how it converts between a tablet and laptop. I am surprised that an Ideapad has better hardware than a Thinkpad, a little disappointing.EDIT: 6 months in update.I am finding it a lot harder to recommend this laptop, having a touch screen is nice, but I almost never fold it back and use it as a tablet because of it's bulky size. I'm probably a bit of a traditionalist but the Metro/Modern UI interface still seems a bit useless to me and is more of a hassle than any kind of benefit.In addition, the fan seems to be getting louder and more annoying, it kicks on and off constantly if doing anything besides simple web browsing, and it's very noticeable when I'm in my apartment or anywhere remotely quiet. Even with just web browsing it still kicks on enough to be annoying. I monitor temps and it stays about 45-50 Celsius when not being used much.There are a couple other features which I feel this laptop really should have, and seeing it as almost standard on equivalents is really disappointing. Intel's WiDi would be great on this as it would allow me to project it onto a TV. This would be an awesome HTPC replacement. The battery life is still disappointing. Unfortunately the alternative is getting an Atom powered convertible/tablet which has horrible performance but twice the battery life. The screen resolution is pretty poor, at least a 1600x900 would be a huge improvement. On a thinkpad which is designed for productivity the low resolution really hinders workflow.Since the tablet mode is not really that functional, I'd recommend the Asus Vivobook lineup. The 11.6inch i3 Vivobook sells for under $500 and offers performance extremely close to the Lenovo Twist. Unfortunately however, even the 14inch i5 Vivobooks still come with just a 1366x768. If I bought again I'd have spent the extra money and gotten the Samsung 700T Convertible. 1080p screen, has WiDi, a stylus/digitizer pen, and a better battery.","November 1, 2012",
laptops,Cool concept but...,T. Byars,R2KS2FFYMT8NLY,3,I really wanted to like this computer but I just didn't. Ultimately after 2 weeks the keyboard stopped working and I could only use the touchpad on the screen. The screen also lagged or froze when going from laptop to tablet. It was a pain. At first I wanted to blame being new to windows 8 as my reason behind hating it...but no. To replace this I went and bought a Sony vaio with windows 8 and I am adjusting just fine. I love it. The lenovo not so much. It also felt like a toy to me so I was hesitant to do any work on it.,"March 5, 2013",

laptops,Lovely little machine with more pros than cons overall but the cons are pretty significant,"Obed Lopez ""Amirite""",R2NHGLTI2KRFNQ,3,"First off, one needs to separate their thoughts and feelings about Win 8 when reviewing this laptop. This review will be almost entirely hardware related.Pros:- Sleek, stylish design with a fantastic soft rubber coating on the body.- Screen, although on the small side, is beautiful with responsive touchscreen capabilities.- Fantastic keyboard texture and key press feedback.- Windows button is a God send for a Win 8 machine!- I actually like having the power button on the side of the screen and volume keys on the front of the screen.- Quiet operation.Cons:- Why is the FN key on the outer most corner of the keyboard? I keep clicking FN when I want to CTRL - V.- Battery life is garbage. Worse yet, the battery continues to drain while the laptop is in Sleep/Hibernate.- The touchpad is garbage. It has a nice feel to it and once the sensitivity is turned waay down, it becomes responsive without being finicky, but it sorely lacks physical left and right mouse buttons. The solid touchpad uses the lower corners to simulate mouse buttons that work fine, but if you're like me and rest your thumb on the left button while using a finger to navigate, the touchpad tends to get confused and the pointer will dance around not knowing what you're trying to do.- The scroll feature on the touchpad is completely useless. There's no markings where to slide leading your to search for that sweetspot that you'll never really find.- Auto rotate is hit or miss.- It could use a tiny bit more space between ports on the sides. The USB plug always seems to bump up against the HDMI plug.It's a lovely little machine with more pros than cons overall but the cons are pretty significant as they are annoying like you wouldn't believe.","December 11, 2013",
laptops,"Loved the design, but ultimately returned it.","Rick ""reb_el""",R174PEPLGZWR3Z,3,"I loved the physical design of this device, how it could switch from a laptop to a tablet, giving me the best of both worlds. Unfortunately, it kept disconnecting from my WIFI, saying the signal was weak, even though it was inches from my router and none of my other devices had trouble connecting to it. I talked to some people and they tell me it's a common problem with Windows 8, so it may not have been the machines fault. Perhaps in a year or so when Windows 8 has all its beta bugs removed, this might be a great device. If so, I will then highly recommend it.","July 3, 2013",

laptops,I don't know if I got a lemon or if it's just the way it is,C. Hughes,R25CRPR4JOFQWW,3,"First thing: My laptop was left on the porch in freezing temperatures for hours. The delivery person did not even ring the doorbell.Issues: The screen frequently goes from light to dark. It seems like it's trying to adjust to the room's lighting but the lighting in the room doesn't change. It makes it very hard to read.The fan is extremely loud. I can't believe how loud it is. It doesn't come on often but when it does, watch out! It will take you by surprise.The touch screen is not very responsive. It works but I find it either being too sensitive or not sensitive enough. I know this may sound crazy but it is true. I don't use the touchscreen often. Perhaps, it's because of this.I'm doing basic internet browsing and the security software says that the browser is ""high usage"". It still works fine.Pros: I upgraded to Windows 8.1. There are a few bugs but the system runs really fast.I like the twist component. It makes it easier to share the screen. It seems pretty sturdy. I just have a feeling that one day, this thing is going to break.It is lighter than I expected. I thought it was going to be too heavy but it is surprisingly lightweight. It's not as light as a tablet, of course, but a lot lighter than my laptop. It's similar in weight to the Samsung Chromebook.I'm not sure if anything got damaged as a result of being in the cold.

laptops,Half way there,"A. Jones ""arj""",RPZM3085XRW8Y,3,"I have had this laptop for almost a year now. I needed a touch screen laptop and this one had a great price. I liked the fact that I could use it as a tablet.Here is what I like.1) It's very lightweight and portable.2) As a photographer, I love the fact that the screen adjusts to the light.3) With the exceptions below, this laptop functions very well. I am able to do all of my work, as long as the screen doesn't decide to rotate on it's own or some swipe gesture is triggered while I am trying to work.4) It's pretty sturdy. I've lugged it around all over the place and even dropped it a couple of times.Here is what I don't like.1) It gets hot. This makes the tablet function, for me, fairly useless. You would not want to hold this on your lap for very long.2) The gestures on the touch pad. This was a huge, gigantic pain in the ass to get rid of. Today, I can't even tell you how I did it. I had to remove the driver and re-install it and spent hours fixing the settings. I did not need these gestures. I have a touch screen. If I want gestures, I'll touch my screen. Trying to use the touch pad to move the mouse cursor around was difficult because gestures would constantly be triggered. I prefer this to using the little red mouse button. This is a preference that should be accounted for int he touch pad settings.3)I'm not sure if this is Windows 8 or my computer, but my internet connection gets dropped a lot, requiring me to reboot my laptop. I know that the issue is with the laptop and not the wireless router because everyone around me is onlne when this happens.4) I can't swipe the screen and get the charms bar. I haven't seen it for months. I started researching a solution for this and gave up after a while.5) Auto Rotate triggers by itself for reasons that I haven't quite figured out.

laptops,"Decent laptop, not without its flaws.",Allen Mak,R247VO0VCB2IA8,3,"Many of the points here will be repeats, but I'd like to add my two cents in case there are some who want to trawl through the reviews. Overall the laptop is very good on paper, acceptable in performance, and has some quirks that could turn people towards another brand.Pros:-Aluminum construction for ""Premium"" feel and look. It is a very nice machine to look at.-Full HD (1080p) Display: Great for viewing your media, putting two documents side-by-side, etc... The display is decent as far as laptops go. The one used in mine is a LP156WF4-SLB5 manufactured by LG.-Microsoft Signature: Clean install of Windows, no bloatware!-Nifty charger with LED that changes colors to indicate level of charge-Discrete Nvidia graphics: relatively decent for *light* gaming, able to switch with the Intel integrated graphics to save power. However this setup may cause bugs or crashes. The latest drivers from both companies go a long way toward mitigating this.Cons:-Edges: Fairly sharp. I haven't been cut or anything, but they can cause a lot of discomfort depending on the position you're using the machine in. Also the lid is hard to open until you figure out a trick or two to use it. (I find that lifting it from the side is easier than trying to get my fingers into the slight notch in front.)-Windows 8. I know this complaint has been hashed endlessly by now, but this was my first Windows 8 PC so I was extremely frustrated trying to break into the new features and Metro UI. Using the touchpad and start menu were very poor experiences for me. Ultimately I used 3rd party software and played with PowerShell to revert some of the changes Microsoft made. Hopefully Windows 8.1 will be better off the bat on PCs!-Lack of peripheral ports: There are only two usb 3.0 ports and one headset/microphone 3.5mm jack. While not be a problem for one on the go, the lack of usb ports and separate 3.5mm jacks (I have separate headset and microphone) disqualify it as a desktop replacement in my book.-Typing experience: While some have not had a problem with the keyboard other than the lack of backlighting (something I find a nonissue), I find that it leaves much to be desired. The keys are *very* shallow-feeling (hardly any accentuation response until you hit the bottom) so typing quickly causes me to skip some letters and occasionally double-type letters. (Normally 85 wpm, laptop 60 wpm) Moreover, I found myself incessantly swiping the touchpad while word processing without any FN-key combination to turn off the touchpad! Thankfully there's a software called Touchpad Blocker, which can turn off the Synaptics touchpad with a simple key combination.Neutral observations:-Audio: Passable, but if you're used to audiophile products they are the typical quality OEM products that will fail to impress. The SRS audio application helps a bit.-Battery life: My typical experience with the battery reveals that 3-5 hours will be the max depending on what you're doing. I don't have much a problem with this, but those on the go will want to tweak the power and hardware settings to get every last drop of life out.-VIZIO driver support: Fairly standard manufacturer driver support on their website (generally speaking *poor*). There are the usual outrageously out of date (Graphics driver) while there was one missing (the touchpad update, judging by the version numbers, it would probably be very important!).-Heat: Under normal circumstances (word processing, watching videos, browsing internet, etc) there have been no problems. However once you get under full cpu load with video editing, playing games, rendering 3d animations, etc... it will get very hot. The exhaust grill is under the monitor hinge at the bottom back of the laptop, which makes it pretty uncomfortable to use on your lap and is extremely poor at dissipating heat until you've finished your task.-Wifi connectivity: Reading all the reviews complaining about the faulty wifi drivers convinced me to immediately upgrade as soon as I switched the machine on. All-in-all it's like many other windows laptops I've used in that I can't tell if it's the router or the laptop itself that is the problem half the time. (I can assure you the other 50% of the time it's the 2.4ghz congestion in my neighborhood...)","July 29, 2013",
laptops,Took a chance on Vizio laptops and am very happy! (Not any more...),"Robert Barkoski ""HighCaliber""",R3RVYZOGJULWN1,3,"UPDATEJust under 2 months after delivery of the laptop the hard drive has failed. I have contacted Vizio's tech support in South Dakota who pride them selves in being the best US based support... Well after going through the steps neccessary to diagnose the hard drive as faulty and proving my purchase through AMAZON, Vizio decided to have the laptop repaired by having me send it in. To send it in they have to email a shipping label of which the tech told me will take no longer then 2 days to arrive. 2 days via email... Your kidding me right? No they are not kidding. So I wait 2 days and then some. NO LABEL in my email and no SPAM either. I call Vizio again: ""I don't understand why you haven't gotten it..."" Checking the email address revealed they have the right email so the tech offers to take over the order and produce a label himself. From there I told him you have 2 hours to send me the label or the laptop gets it...3 hours later: NO LABEL! I call AMAZON who agrees to exchange (I love the hardware and if the drive fails on the new one, I'll replace it myself) the laptop on the spot. The AMAZON CSR then says I'll email you a shipping label (in my head: NOOOOO!) My email dings and my label is there! Within 30 minutes I had my busted laptop at the UPS store. Good riddance! Thank you AMAZON!----------------------------------------OLD REVIEWOk so I know Vizio makes a good TV for the money but when I saw they make laptops I'll admit I giggled. However, being open minded I looked into them. I needed a laptop with a core i7 and 1TB of storage. That's right a TERABYTE of storage. All the fancy cloud storage in the world can't hold an LCD to that. Now on with the review:PROS:This laptop is well built with an aluminum chassis and exterior. Holding one corner produces NO flex in the frame. Pressing on the back of the LCD produces NO spots on the screen and the rubberized bottom makes the laptop a joy to grip.The keyboard is simple and useful for common typing tasks. If you need a number pad look elsewhere. Typing on it they way I do (my fingers are heavy) makes me feel like the keyboard can handle the abuse.The screen has a matte finish so it easy to see with less glare and it runs in a native 1920 x 1080 (HD) resolution. Colors are nice and vibrant and the refresh rate is good with no ghosting at all.A dedicated video card! Sporting a GeForce GT 640M LE, this Vizio can handle a lot more then solitaire. I'm talking FPS or games like Fallout New Vegas at 1080 resolution.Speed! with a Core i7 I was happy but with a hybrid flash drive and 1 TB of storage I'm ecstatic! The thing boots insanely fast and hasn't bogged down yet. I've thrown Photoshop, Vegas HD 10 and games at it and it just keeps going.Battery Life! I feel the battery life is very good for a core i7 laptop with dedicated video card. Now I haven't timed it but I've never said to my self: ""The battery is dead already?""...CONS:Heat. Playing a game generates a lot of heat below and to the left of the spacebar. I suspect this is the location of the video card and pushing 1080 res. at 30 fps is very demanding and the heat shows.The touchpad is nice but I turned off the pinch zoom gesture as it repeatedly zoomed when I wanted to scroll.Wireless. Out of the box the wifi would only maintain a connection to ANY network for 5 - 30 minutes. After an email to tech support in South Dakota, that's right South Dakota in the USA, I received a friendly yet detailed set of instructions to fix the problem. Since then the wifi has not malfunctioned.SummarizeWho should buy this: Power Users who need to have their data with them, secured and not floating in the cloud. Also people who work for a living but like to play serious game titles to unwind. People who do light video editing. People with good taste :) People who love change (Windows 8)Who should not buy this: Avid gamers who do nothing but play games, you'll burn it up before the warranty. People who just browse the web and socialize on face-tube ;) People who want something lite-weight. People who hate change (Windows 8)","January 13, 2013",
laptops,Great specs but quality issues...roll the dice if you feel lucky,DukeofWagner,R30GFKKUJNJ2AP,3,"This machine has the best specs for the price of any laptop on the market...I7 processor, 1080p display, 8gb ram, 1tb hard drive. The display is beautiful as advertised and the overall fit and finish is clean. Problem is, both machines I received were defective. The first machine had a bad USB port. I called Vizio support and they were fantastic. They concluded that the port was defective and immediately offered to replace the unit. The next unit I received had issues with the fan turning on and running for no apparent reason even when virtually nothing was running. If the fan did shut off (if say the machine was idle for a while), it would turn back on the second I launched a web browser. Not exactly high stress activity. Once again, called Vizio support and they concluded that I needed yet a third machine. That's when I decided to return it to Amazon. I polled other users on Amazon and there were mixed responses as far as the issue with the fan. Some had problems, some didn't. That's why I gave it three stars..If you're lucky enough to get a unit with no defects, this machine is about as good as it gets. If not, have plenty of packing tape on hand and get ready to be on a first name basis with Fed-X and UPS.Pros:Beautiful displayGreat lookingGreat performanceBest price performance on the marketClean Windows 8 install.

If you are going to try to click or drag conventionally, make sure your thumb is firmly planted in the lower left hand corner or results will vary. The only way I really could get it to work for me was to keep the default ""tapping"" on. Also, make sure you download the touchpad update from Vizio support immediatelyAnother con: You will experience Wifi network drops unless you download the Wifi update from Vizio's site as well.Conculsion: Not quite ready for prime time. Vizio seems to be getting better with each generation of laptop and maybe third time will be the charm. But right now, they clearly have quality issues.","January 24, 2013",
laptops,Performs well but with some design flaws,Paul S. Lewis,R2101ZXOEV7EIG,3,"This laptop performs well but has a few quirks that make it not ideal.The design is nice. The computer itself has a very clean look.It seems very quick. It easily handled any program I used on it such as Photoshop where I often do some fairly intense procedures. I'm not a gamer so I can't comment on that.The screen was very crisp & clear.What I do not like are many of the outside connections. The power brick is one of the biggest I have ever seen and it is impossible to find a third party charger like Targus or Kensington or even the cut rate foreign ones so if you want a 2nd charger you are stuck with buying one from Vizio at their outrageous price. The SD card does not fit in all the way so it would not be practical to use it as a ready boost or leave it in there. The ethernet connection is a little funky as it is hinged to put the connector in (Mine failed after about two weeks).So if you can live with those few oddities, this computer could work for you. Certainly the price is right, well below what most companies are asking for similar computers.","February 9, 2014",

As other reviewers have mentioned, the sound from the speakers is very tinny and not good. And even more disappointing is the poor internet connectivity. Compared to my old Inspiron 1501, the signal is much weaker on this computer. I was concerned about the screen going black, but found that was only the screen saver going black after the default setting of one minute. I don't find this computer to be any faster than my old AMD Athlon processor. And the built in mouse is very sensitive and in the road. I quickly bought a wireless mouse to use.

I work in the IT field and knew all the guts of the computer would work for her, but when something as simple as a touchpad causes issues and for some reason it is slow out of the box that is never a good sign.

Amazon ended up canceling my order without telling me and I didn't find out until I checked the shipping status on Dec. 23. After almost 2 hours on the phone and speaking to three levels of customer service managers, Amazon re-ordered my product, gave me a discount and promised it would be delivered by Dec 26. After Christmas had gone by I was informed that it wouldn't be delivered until the 27th. I again had to spend an hour on the phone to have the package rerouted since I was only visiting my family for Christmas and would be returning home the 27th. Amazon offered me a $30 amazon credit which I accepted but only was granted $10. We FINALLY got the laptop at home on the 27th and upon opening it, the laptop was inoperable, the LCD was non functioning. We immediately called Amazon and Dell and they said it could be fixed by a dell technician within 24-48 hours. As you can probably guess, this also didn't happen! After many phone calls and emails, we finally got the laptop fixed January 4, 2013. The laptop works fine and my girlfriend is happy but this was am experience I will never forget, I know this isn't the norm but it seems like everything that could go wrong did, and Amazon seemed to believe it was no fault of their own!Bottom line: Good laptop especially for a student, good battery life, but go ahead and buy it at Best Buy so you don't have to wait, or deal with nonfunctional laptops!","January 6, 2013",
laptops,Seems Great..Just Wish I Could Use It!!,"Aficianado, ""Music, Film and Book Lover""",R2QEBWHHYNABAM,3,"I picked this particular model of laptop to purchase because I wanted to get Windows 7 and not Windows 8 (which seems to be in the process of being poorly received by users just as Vista was earlier). That's a story for another review and another day however. I also purchased this laptop because I liked the other features that it offered (such as an excellent keyboard) and at a good price point. Dell does offer a great range of computers and with a very attractive selection of features. Overall, this one is a beautiful machine and at a good price. Now for the problems, however.This is the fourth Dell computer (and first Dell laptop) that I have purchased over the years. Of the first three Dell computers I purchased, one was DOA and had to be returned to Dell for a complete replacement. The other two died within the first few hours of operation and required a Dell tech to come to my home to repair them.And....what do you know? Exactly 2.5 hours of use of this laptop it died completely as well. That's four out of four failures on Dell computers for me. After a fruitless hour on the phone with a Dell tech, he finally informed me that I would have to ship the laptop back to Dell for repair or replacement (shipping and repair at their expense under warranty of course). It took several other phone calls and e-mails to finally get the machine back to Dell. Right now, my laptop is somewhere in the bowels of Dell's repair depot in Houston, TX being repaired and prepared for return to me.To be fair to Dell, the problem in this laptop turned out to be a bad hard drive (not of a Dell brand and which of course was not manufactured by Dell). The problem on one of my other Dell computers also turned out to be a bad drive from another manufacturer. Also, the laptop seemed quite spiffy for the several hours that I have spent with it before it failed.Some people may call me a slow learner for continuing to purchase Dell computers even after all of these problems but it's been my experience that Dell works hard to correct situations such as these once they occur and I am eventually left with a fine computer. I do fault Dell over specific weaknesses in their service operation, such as length of time it takes for them to grasp the particular problem I am describing (even when it should be quite simple for them to do so) or my not being able to understand what the person on the other end of the phone call is saying. Unfortunately, getting caught in the Dell ""service pipeline"" is usually not a very pleasant experience.Dell service seems to be becoming aware of this however, since they now seem to redoubling their efforts to try and improve their customer satisfaction. For example, whenever I have talked with a service person recently, their supervisor gets on the phone at the end of the call and asks how the tech performed. Sometimes the supervisor will not get on the phone but will call you back later to follow-up and see if you are satisfied with the transaction and if your problem was solved to your satisfaction.Also, I notice that Dell is starting now to respond to negative reviews on Amazon by providing soothing balm and apologies for the user's poor experience and by providing a list of other ""options"" such as their ""Dell Cares"", ""Dell Community Forums"", ""Facebook Account"", etc. I have tried those options and found them either only marginally useful or completely unuseful. This entire process seems to be an attempt at damage control.Only time will tell if I have any other problems with this laptop once it is returned to me. My other Dells settled down and performed quite well after their initial problems however. The oldest one, a Dimension has been performing flawlessly (knock on wood) for 15 years now after being replaced originally. One of the other ones is less than a year old. I do not regret this laptop purchase however since it seems as if it is a great machine for my particular needs. I just wish the darned thing had worked and I will update this review as necessary once I receive my computer again and can start (hopefully) using it for real! Right now, I have given this review a marginal 3 stars (barely above 2 stars). If the machine settles down and works as well as my other Dells have once repaired, I would consider it a 5 star machine!","February 20, 2013",
laptops,"Great system, assembly quality questionable.",Soopur Jeenyus,R25CNGS9AIMII1,3,"I didn't order this exact one off of Amazon, but rather ordered directly from HP. Generally speaking, I really enjoy the laptop. Everything seems to work great and it has all the bells and whistles you would expect from a unit at this price point. Screen resolution is bright and sharp, the keyboard has a really nice feel to it, all the peripheral connections are really nice. Loaded it with Win8 Pro and it's running great.My only concern is the build quality. As I was swiping to change screens (from the left edge of the screen) I noticed that the screen was actually sticking out and above the case creating a little lip. It's not really consistent with the rest of the edges, so I'm pretty sure it's not a design 'feature.' When you press on it in the lower left corner, it seems to stick down into place, but come on... for a $1300+ laptop, you shouldn't have to squeeze the display back together because it isn't assembled properly. I'm a little surprised that this made it through QA/QC. Now to decide if all the positives outweigh the shoddy workmanship.Edit 12/28 - So I went ahead and got a RMA for the system I ordered directly from HP. In the meantime, I went ahead and ordered one directly from Amazon just to see if it was a consistent manufacturing defect, or if I had just gotten a bad unit. Well, in traditional Amazon fashion, the system arrived in 1 day and it doesn't have the same problem at all! Very excited to have received a good unit.","December 22, 2012",
laptops,Good Computer But Flimsy and Fragile,T. Blondie,RWOIKDLUBNPIE,3,"I have owned my HP Spectre XT for several months and have enjoyed using it. The picture quality is good, the sound quality is OK (wish it were better, especially since it has the Beats audio upgrade) and the laptop is lightweight. I'm not a huge fan of Windows 8 which is what is loaded on this machine, but that's not HP's fault.The biggest problem with this computer is that it is poorly designed or built. It has a cheap, flimsy feel and so I have been very reluctant to take it to work or to travel with it, opting to bring my much sturdier Motorola tablet with me instead (that thing is built like a tank).My feelings about the HP Spectre's flimsiness were backed up when, about a week ago, the hinges started creaking every time I opened them. Then, lo and behold, the left hinge gave way and the left hand corner of the screen popped right off of the machine. I called HP support and they said that this was not covered under warranty but that they would be willing to fix it for free anyway, as long as they didn't decide that it was due to ""accidental damage"", in which case they would charge me $179 to fix it.Huh? I did a Google search to see if other people were having this same problem with the Spectre's screen just deciding to fall off and, sure enough, there were over 800 hits about this complaint on just one IT forum.As for my machine, I guess I'll have to send it back for repair and hope that the HP technicians aren't in a bad mood, because it seems like the $179 charge would get billed to me at their whim.Also, FYI, even though HP is only fixing the hinge and screen of this machine, the customer service rep informed me that they would be turning on my computer, going into the operating system, backing up files including (but maybe not limited too?!) My Documents, My Pictures and My Contacts. So, if I do send it in for repair, I'm going to have to back up my folders and then reset the machine to factory settings before sending it in. Ugh--I wish that this model allowed me to switch out hard drives so that I could just send it with an empty drive and save myself a lot of work.In short, I would not recommend this machine to anyone who needs a laptop of even average sturdiness. If you're willing to treat this one with kid gloves and maybe not open or close it too much (the hinges can't take even a few months of normal wear and tear), then it is a fairly nice machine.","January 22, 2014",

laptops,Nice idea...not so great in practice,"V. Tudor ""MD""",RI60TBQUVB234,3,"The laptop looks and feels nice - yet it lacks performance and stability.The hardware + the Windows 8 OS combination is not great. The screen is not always responsive to touch, the system crashes every 15-20min, while the mouse pad is very bad. If the system goes idle - forget about recovering your work - the only way it starts is through a forced shut down (quite annoying behavior).The laptop/tablet is good for travel as it is light and thin and fits in any bag ... yet if you have serious work to do while on travel, think twice .. you may be better off with a traditional, more powerful laptop.I am not sure if it is the HP hardware or the Windows 8 that makes this laptop so unstable in use ...

laptops,"Great, when using as intended.",CoffeeSnob,RXHN5KKR3P971,3,"I have a normal company-supplied laptop with windows 7 that I use for Work-related stuff. My wife has her own laptop and an Ipad, which I use occasionally for pretty light duty stuff (general web-browsing and reading). She got a job that requires she travel most of the time, and she takes her laptop and ipad with her. I miss having those two devices around so I can my have work computer logged onto the VPN while I do all my personal stuff on separate devices. I tried Win 8 on a non-touchscreen computer and didn't like it, but I couldn't justify the expenditure of buying a Macbook and an ipad for my relatively casual computing. I also considered a chromebook, but they don't run Skype, which is one of my primary uses for whatever device I would buy. I decided to bite the bullet and buy one of these dual-function Windows 8 devices, and settled on the envy x2 when I found it on sale at a brick and mortar store (sorry Amazon, they had a better price)After using my X2, I like Windows 8 much better now that I've been using it with a touchscreen. It actually makes sense to me now; For use only as a computer with a mouse, I like OS X and Windows 7 better, and for use only on a Mobile device I like iOS and android better, but if one is going to use the same device as both a PC and a tablet, and therefore a single operating system for both, Windows 8 is the tool for the job.Although it doesn't have the power for serious gaming or the storage capacity of a regular laptop, it browses like a PC, feels solid like a laptop and is easy to type on. As a tablet, if you can get over the fact that it's a little bigger (only a little) than and Ipad, it really is a very functional Tablet once you're used to Windows 8. It seems really well built with the Aluminum cover, the substantial feeling keyboard and the awesome connection between the screen and the base while still being relatively small and light.*I feel the need to amend my review: With the screen detached, it appears to work fine and was actually a very nice tablet until I tried to use it while it was sitting on a plastic tray table on an airplane and the whole left side of the touch screen was unresponsive. I returned it and got a new one, which had the same problem... worked fine in my hand, but nothing on the left side worked if it was lying down on a non-conductive surface. Since I was 0 for 2, I did some research a found that this is a common problem and there were several demonstrations if it on youtube [...] I called HP, and they were actually very nice, but they admitted that it was a known problem and the engineers were working on it and they would give me a call back when they had a solution.I didn't want to wait, so I took it back to the store and got something else. The next day HP called back, I didn't bother to answer because I had already gotten something else that I was happy with. For all I know they may have had some kind of update that would fix it or they may have offered to replace it with a newer version. I was actually generally impressed with HPs customer service. I know my wife types with her thumbs while holding the tablet with her fingers. Someone who types like she does might not ever have noticed, but I set it down and type with my fingers, so I didn't find it to be a tolerable flaw, even if it was a cool little machine.","October 2, 2013",
laptops,4 months later..,Chad Turney,ROU7OD3F5V0AJ,3,"Well it has been 4 months since we purchased this. I can say a few pros and cons about it. The form factor is nice, switching from laptop to tablet and having lots of battery life is great.The cpu is slow but it is fast enough to handle basic apps and internet stuff.Don't expect to get far gaming, although it should handle windows 8 store games just fine.We had to send this computer in to hp because files were getting corrupted, which brings me to my next topic:The SSD failed us. We sent the tablet in to HP to have it looked at and all they did was return it with a fresh install of Windows, no repairs to any hardware despite having it for 8 days. (+ 4 days shipping) I am pretty sure the SSD is not right with this tablet, but HP insists it is ok.Now, two weeks later it still has the same problems where it cannot open any windows 8 apps, windows updates will not download, and sfc /scannow cannot fix the corruption because the recovery source is corrupted. This is the same situation it was in before I sent it in for repair. Erg.I really think there is something wrong with the SSD. Who makes an SSD that only reads about 20MB/s? Amazon has been kind enough to allow us to return this, so we will be returning it and getting a second Acer W700, that is a tablet which we have been very happy with.","April 30, 2013",

Windows 8 locks up occasionally but that is to be expected with a new operating system until the bugs get worked out. Updates are a daily thing (mostly windows defender) which is good. The Keyboard headphone jack audio volume however is disappointingly low at about half the Tablet headphone jack volume and even when cranked up @ 100 % is barely audible through earphones at times. I've consulted the ""Geek Squad"" @ Best Buy on this and they are aware of the problem from H.P. w/ Beats Audio but have no solution except a possible hardware update of the keyboard in the future. All of the control panel volume settings have been optimized. I think that H.P. should have a Recall just like the Auto companies when there is a design defect such as this. I did my research on this before buying and didn't see anything out there on this issue and so I feel compelled to be the ""whistle blower"". I hope that this review works it's way back to somebody in charge who can make the necessary changes to keep another American company's image from being tarnished.I've also noticed that the battery drains excessively when mated together as a Laptop(down approx.5%/day)when shut down and unplugged from AC and will be in the charge mode for quite some time when you resume using it and plugged back into AC again. My windows 7 HP Pavilion on the other hand can be shut down for weeks and is usually @ 100% when it is powered back up again.

laptops,Disapointed ..,Rebecca E. Kempton,R1OZIAM6DXDGRH,3,"I personally wanted to give this a 2 star... but then I had to consider the price and gave it a 3 star.The volume f11 and f12 do not work.The nearly four inch wrist rest is to deep, its very uncomfortable to type when sitting at the table with this laptop ( the edges are actually sharp).It has a overall ""cheap"" feeling ...I guess because it is inexpensive ( I keep trying to remember that fact).I do like the size of the touch pad, but the buttons don't feel like they will last.I am not a fan of the low profile keyboard either ( however all newer computers seem to have them now).It did boot up fine ... and the computer itself seems to be working well ( this is my 3 Dell, so I'm a repeat customer) but the case/ or shell appears substandard.So if this is back up ...or if you are using it with a TV, I'm sure its a great buy ....if its for everyday use, this may not be the one. ( I'll update this review in a month or so ...after I have used it for a while). I am trying to tell myself I will get used to windows 8 ....so far I don't believe myself.*************** I want to update my review , I have decided to return this laptop. With the 2 function keys not working and and the right button on on the mouse pad sticking .... I decided that it had to much against it , for a BRAND new computer. ( even a inexpensive one).I was unsure about my ability to return the defective laptop , because it was not actually ""dead on arrival"" and I had used it for several days ... I sent a detailed message to Amazon , and in less than 24 HR I was sent a return label.I have always been 100% pleased with AMAZON and with this situation they rose to the occasion. I am slightly concerned , because the ""reason"" for the return on the label says ""different from what was ordered"" and that is not the case ... other than I ordered a laptop that should not be defective. I am hopeful that the return process goes well ... and I look forward to buying a new laptop as soon as my credit it processed .","May 15, 2013",

""g.k. bevido""",RSUEN9GHVMVNP,3,"I had to spend $100.00, two visits by techs from a warranty I have that covers all computer related items, to have this cleaned up... and now it's finally working properly. First - delivery of original order placed gets lost, I have to wait for second one to be shipped then notice I'm charged for two even though I have email saying credits were issued. But the reason for three stars is that it works now, after the tech had to practically rebuild it. Almost everything in my Control Panel was some type of ""ware"" if not a virus. For once though, I was glad to NOT see 50 google applications. So once this is working properly, registers cleaned and do not install anything calling itself Microsoft Register CLeaning Pro because it is not really from Microsoft. Meanwhile, you will get pop up warnings from the real Microsoft telling you there are registry issues ... and the CLeaning Pro pops open with a Windows type logo. This is a virus. Many of this type of ""false pop-up scams or spam"" happen, either claiming it's from Dell or Microsoft at the same time the real Dell or Microsoft is warning you something is not right. McAfee came installed for a 30 day trial, but after I put my own anti-virus and other protection their appeared to be far more than McAfee detected. I bought this NEW, after the horrible mistake of purchasing a refurbished computer -- which is a whole other story. ANyway this Dell is okay, but slow and doesn't stream well. I don't hear any improvement in sound from Waves Maxx Audio (my old laptop had Beats Audio which produced a far better sound for whatever mode you put it in. Maybe Windows 8 is not for me ... after going through many, many Android devices - I needed a regular laptop and this Dell model sounded right for the price at the time I purchased it (a month ago). This was a Prime purchase but came directly from Dell - or from Dell to AMazon - and it is not a bad computer for the price - just don't buy it for your main device. Most likely you'll find listening to music and streaming movies are better with devices you may have already. The fact that half the things in my computer after 2 weeks were found to be bad news - is the main reason I only gave it three stars. I'm not one to go randomly from site to site so I cannot understand the extra $100 I had to spend to get this to work properly - also, if it's speed you need - this is not the computer for you. Otherwise it is nice to have around when Android devices prohibit your access to many things.*UPDATE December 15, 2013: A/C adapter is junk. It's the kind that has a heavy transformer thing at an odd length and so heavy, it ends up pulling itself apart if plugged in while in use, which is not that often for me. One good feature this laptop has is its warning when battery is below 20% or if you leave A/C in too long. In other words, it helps you help ITs battery last longer ...I HOPE. I had a hard time finding a replacement A/C charger/adapter at a decent price, too. I've owned this just over a month now- it required many, many updates and drivers and now the Cap-Lock key does the opposite of what it is there for. This happens right after 30 days .... unbelievable. I've had too many computer mishaps this year so I am satisfied with this thing as it is now but not thrilled. I'm not sure if my wifi/e-printer has a problemor if it's Windows 8 that doesn't allow a compatible update ... in any case that year old printer is now useless in conjunction with this laptop.

This is more annoying to me than the Wi-Fi.Other than those niggling issues, the screen's bright and easy-to-read, performance is awesome (number crunching, and games: beyond Portal 2, I don't play a lot of graphics-intensive games), and it's light.I wish the power adapter used more of a standard plug so I could share AC adapters with others, but I suppose that's by design so you don't accidentally bake your computer.","June 29, 2013",
laptops,GREAT with just one real caveat!,"Joel G. Hancock ""JGHancock""",R10FDY2D3GRKMO,3,"I've had my Yoga for almost two months. It is by far the best notebook/laptop I have ever owned. I especially enjoy the keyboard. I find myself picking up my Yoga rather than setting in front of my desktop when I need to prepare a long document.The performance is excellent and the form factor is really comfortable.My only complaint is that the battery life has been much less than what I anticipated. I can't tell that it is any better than my ASUS standard notebook that I have used for the past two years. I find it hard to believe the other reviews I have read that talk of six or even eight hours of usage, even with light duty. My main use is in surfing or in typing text documents, and seldom do anything with large or graphic files, but it is the exception for me to get more than three hours without having to plug-in.One of my first purchases after settling-in with the Yoga was an extra changer to make sure I had one in my carrying case as well as near my work desk.Other than that I couldn't be happier and highly recommend it for anyone --- unless battery life is a major concern.Update 9/10/2013 Changing to 3 stars from 4. The short battery-life has gotten steadily worse with use. But that's not why I am making this addtion. Instead, I noticed over the weekend that one of the function keys had been displaced and I could not find it. The Lenovo service lines was closed until Monday morning. Once I got an answer on Monday it took over half an hour of winding through a maize of phone numbers and recordings before I finally was able to speak to someone who could help. They advised that I could not just replace the key, but had to send the entire computer back to be serviced and have the keyboard replaced. They sent me a RMA that required that I repackage the unit and then take it to a Federal Express office 50 miles away to have it shipped. For some reason their authorization would not allow that I drop it off at a local franchise or pickup. I am told it will be seven to ten business days before I can expect to get it back.

Generally it works just fine but from time to time it just doesn't want to co-operate.The on screen pointer tends to disappear occasionally, forcing a restart (at least with the new Windows this is fast)I like the screen and feel of the laptop generally.

laptops,Decent laptop but INCONSISTENT performance,"Joe Rhodes ""JR""",R1VTXWRGKHPNE7,3,"This is a decent laptop but it definitely did not meet my expectations unfortunately especially considering cost.I have had this laptop for almost a year now and I will say it has been fast and reliable for my purposes; basic everyday use including internet browsing, microsoft office, Netflix/Youtube. It has worked decently and never really had me to the point of ripping out my hair.The problem I have with the laptop are its ""Yoga"" features. These features that you pay a hefty price for are not as reliable as basic use like you would a regular laptop. First of all, the touch screen is hopeless. For some reason there are times where it works fine mostly with just minor annoyances of hitting the wrong buttons, but other days it doesn't even function. For example a screen will pop up saying ""blah, blah, blah"" then an ""Okay"" button. No matter how many times you hit the button, it won't work. This is especially irritating when you have the laptop in tablet mode where there's only touchscreen available. In this case you need to open it back up an use the navigation pad. For this reason, I never use tablet mode anymore. Its pretty heavy as a tablet anyway.Another serious flaw is the drop in performance when the screen flips, especially upside down. When the laptop is in tent mode for example, everything especially the touch screen slows down and loses functionality. Watching Youtube or Netflix in tent mode can sometimes be problematic because of that.One other thing I don't really like is that it doesn't have an ethernet cable port. This however was not a big problem for me since I was able to buy a USB converter for ethernet. I just think for $900 (what I payed at the time) they should include it with the package.In conclusion this Lenovo laptop is just alright. It is a little bit ahead of itself in the featured technology, but what can I say it works and is reliable for everything I need to do with it. I never had to get it repaired which I am thankful for but I spent enough that I shouldn't.I don't recommend this laptop because I wouldn't have bought it again if I could go back even with the couple hundred dollars dropped. The flaws in the technology need to be addressed and there are other choices out there that offer the same and more for less.","April 24, 2014",

laptops,"Amazing high definition IPS screen undermined by mediocre keyboard, trackpad, and wifi",Amazon Customer,R3IXWKQG4YX6VB,3,"I bought the Lenovo Yoga after observing one of my friends using it in class one day. My mistake. I should have made sure I tried the keyboard before ordering one myself. But in my defense, I never imagined that Lenovo could make a bad keyboard. After all, the keyboard on my $600 Lenovo V570 was the best thing about that particular laptop.Imagine my surprise when I received my Yoga and discovered that it lacks a typically excellent Lenovo keyboard. In fact, the keyboard on this machine (I'm typing this review on it) is infuriating for anyone who's ever used a decent keyboard in their life (like the keyboard of a Lenovo ThinkPad or MacBook). It's simply soft and mushy with lots of springiness. And some of the keys--among them the minus, plus, and top-right row of function keys--actually creak (i.e., make a creaking sound) when pressed! As a writer and programmer who intended to use the Yoga heavily in grad school as well as at work, I need a good keyboard which isn't an exercise in frustration every time I use it. For heavy typing, I think most typists will find the Yoga's keyboard quite frustrating.On top of the keyboard issues you can expect to experience trackpad frustration as the Synaptics drivers apparently crash intermittently making using the trackpad an adventure. Ugh. I'm sure they'll release better drivers for it soon, but in the meantime it's very frustrating.But yes, on the bright side, the Yoga does feature an exceptional IPS screen. I love the resolution, clarity, color vibrancy, contrast, and viewing angles. It's a thing of beauty. And I really like how the Yoga looks. I just dislike the keyboard.[EDIT ON 11/14/12]In the process of self-upgrading the RAM in my Yoga from 4GB to 8GB I somehow managed to fix the ""creaking"" sound I heard before when pressing the minus and plus and F9-F12 keys. They're still not as quiet as the rest of the keys, but at least they don't produce a pronounced and odd sound for a keyboard to make. Now they just produce an louder sound when struck than the rest of the keys. It's possible that further experimentation with the metal tab behind that section of the keyboard will further improve the sound issue. We'll see. At least it doesn't sound anymore like those keys need a strong shot of WD40.[UPDATE ON 12/1/12]I really really really tried to get over myself and get used to the keyboard but the longer I used it the more work it was. It was just a difficult keyboard to use. You know how it is when you use a keyboard without consistent key action? Well, I found out, and it wasn't fun. When your fingers can't rely on every key responding the same way it means that your hands and brain have a difficult time learning how to use the keyboard efficiently. You're constantly hitting a key too hard or not hard enough--or letting your finger rest too long on it so you get repeated characters. And yes it's possible that I might have had a bad keyboard. But the difficult bouncy keyboard on top of the sub-par trackpad experience was just too much for me to take. I guess as I get older I have less patience with a product not being satisfactory right out of the gate. I have less patience with dinking around with support trying a new keyboard, or waiting for new drivers to come out for the trackpad. I just want things to work. So I sent the Yoga back to BestBuy and reverted to using my Lenovo V570 (with it's solid keyboard and good trackpad) while I wait for a new HP dv6t Envy to arrive next week. My hopes for the HP are that the keyboard is solid with consistent response, the trackpad is at least good, and the screen is good (I ordered the 1080p matte screen). I wish everyone else the best with their Yogas. If the keyboard is good on yours, awesome. If not, I feel for you. Like I said before: great screen, awesome form factor (the modes really are very useful), mediocre (at best) keyboard and trackpad. However, as a supplemental device I might consider purchasing one of these as long as I didn't plan on using the keyboard heavily. I.e., I suspect that the Yoga is a better device all-around than the Microsoft Surface (though I haven't used a Surface). It has a real keyboard, the screen is amazing, and the fact that it has a sturdy 360 degree hinge allows you to place it in all kinds of useful positions you'd never be able to put a tablet or laptop.","November 14, 2012",
laptops,Hold off on buying a Yoga,"Richard L. Stokes ""Businessman and proud MGA ...",R16CRIYNHUJGHG,3,"I waited for weeks until my local Best Buy had a Yoga in stock and finally got one last weekend. After 30 minutes or so, I noticed problems with both the Touchpad and the touchscreen.Touchpad - stops and starts every few seconds and occasionally jerks across the screen. I consulted the Lenovo forums and discovered that some users had success with disabling the Bluetooth service so I did this. The jerking stopped, but now I'm lucky if the touchpad works at all. I'll occasionally get 30 seconds out of it but then it goes dead until the next reboot.Touchscreen - mostly works out. I haven't had issues when sliding from the edges of the screen like some others have reported. However, the touchscreen will occasionally go completely dead, sometimes just within individual apps (ie: if I alt-tab away from the app, the touchscreen will work for every other app. Alt-tabbing back doesn't fix the issue.) I have a lot of problems with phantom double-taps as well.It's a shame because the form factor for this laptop is incredible.

It is IPS, has great viewing angles and nice colors. Compared to most laptops, 1600 x 900 is ""high resolution"".

But this is no great fault of the Yoga itself, just the nature of our becoming accustomed to higher-resolution screens.In typical Lenovo fashion, the 360-degree hinge is very strong. When you move the screen to a certain position, it will stay there, and that's something not every laptop can claim. It opens and closes easily, and fully opens into ""Tablet Mode"" with a satisfying snap. But on this point, the Yoga is not much use as a tablet, first of all being extremely awkward with keys exposed on the back (forget carrying an extra sleeve along), even though the keys and touchpad are disabled in this mode. And furthermore it is much too heavy for true tablet use. But as a slate with a stand (Lenovo: ""Stand Mode""), the Yoga fills a very nice niche.KEYBOARDThe keyboard on the Yoga is mediocre. Coming from a Lenovo ThinkPad, it was one of my biggest disappointments, since key action is somewhat mushy and the keyboard itself has flex in the middle. It also lacks backlighting, which is a strange omission for a higher-end laptop. In its favor, the keyboard does include dedicated Home and End keys, as well as function keys that do not require the user to depress the ""Fn"" key to use them.TOUCHPADThe touchpad on the Yoga is one of the best on a Windows machine. It has a nice texture which allows your finger to glide smoothly across, and pointing is accurate. In addition, two-finger scrolling is very smooth, unlike some of the competition.WIRELESSIn my use of the Yoga, I did not have problems with the wireless. However, the wireless card does not support 802.11a (5 GHz) WiFi, which means it will not be able to take advantage of a dual-band router's ability to avoid congestion on 2.4 GHz frequencies. This, again, is an unfortunate omission for a laptop in this price range, and should give pause to any buyer who wants full compatibility with all home router technologies.There have been a number of user complaints with regard to limited range on the Yoga WiFi, though I did not have a chance to validate these claims.NOISEHere is the deal-breaker for me. The fan on this laptop runs constantly, and in a quiet environment, is very audible. My unit's fan was not defective, as it did not make any grinding or scraping noises like some have reported, but the constant `woosh' of fan noise at a volume and frequency higher than other models was too much to be ignored in a quiet environment. Some work all day in a noisy office or house and will not notice this, others, like me, spend lots of time in a quiet work environment or bedroom, and the noise is overpowering. Hopefully Lenovo will rectify this issue through a software update at some point, but for now, it is definitely an issue to be aware of.UPGRADABILITYThe Yoga scores a big plus in the upgradability category, since users can not only upgrade their SSD, but also add a second SSD, as well as upgrade their RAM. There are several how-to articles available on the web to accomplish this.WRAP-UPMy overall assessment of the Ideapad Yoga is that it is a great concept not quite ready for prime-time. The pretty screen and acrobatic form-factor are overshadowed by a mediocre keyboard and a noisy fan, not to mention the glaring omission of 5 GHz wireless capability for dual-band routers, and the question of how long the finish will endure before it looks as dingy as the store model.I ended up exchanging my Yoga for an Asus Zenbook Prime Touch (UX31A-BHI5T11). The Zenbook has some quality-control issues with its screen and inferior trackpad, but otherwise has a better (and backlit) keyboard, better wireless, quieter fan, and sharper screen, all coming in a thinner and lighter profile. Though I would currently recommend the Asus over the Yoga, I think all of the PC manufacturers need to take a closer look at their consumer feedback and quality control before rushing the next device to market.","January 22, 2013",

But by the time I was setting up my password it didn't work.Also during 1 of my 3 re-installs of windows 8 I seemed to discover that the lenovo didn't like that i had a usb mouse in place during this process as it seems to have made the touch screen keyboard not work at all after install the the touch screen wouldn't always work. Re-installing windows 8 without the mouse provided a better result but on screen keyboard stopped working within minutes of 3rd re-install. Then I ran the updates and all seems well now.Once I got into windows it worked for about 10 minutes then, same problem wouldn't stay on the screen.I ran a search for windows updates, it found 21 updates, I ran the updates and now the on screen keyboard seems to be working correctly.Also noticed a weird thing that when playing a streaming radio station in metro if I switched to desktop mode the music would stop playing.

laptops,"HDD crashed in 2 months... ""Click of Death""",Customer1113,R3EL6BT71736MB,3,"The form factor, specs, and cost all made the Vivobook a product that I was excited to have and to recommend to whoever I came across. Of course, the highlight was the touchscreen which is VITAL if you're using Windows 8. Adding to that was the excellent workmanship (metallic palmrest) and the perfect size and weight (liked it better than the Zenbook or MacBook Air).But less than 2 months later, it all turned into a nightmare.I can give the conclusion from the very beginning: Swap out the 500GB HDD for a 256GB SSD as soon as you take it out the box. I'm convinced that Asus put in a cheap part (HDD) in order to keep the cost low. But you will pay dearly for that error.1. During normal usage, the dreaded ""Click of Death"" came, which is when the head/arm in the HDD touches the platter (disk). I tried to shut it down as soon as possible. But the next time it turned on, the OS wouldn't load and only the BIOS screen would appear. The machine was effectively dead.2. Asus's warranty would replace the HDD but wouldn't recover the data, all while taking 2 weeks to return the machine to you. And just opening the machine to swap the HDD yourself would void that warranty.3. Upon opening the HDD, I found that the head was defective (after just 2 months) and tried everything to recover the data. The pros would charge approx $2,400 (no exageration) to repair this kind of HDD problem. After 3 days, this became a lost cause and I knew I'd have to start from scratch.4. I installed a 256GB SSD.5. Asus wouldn't give me an ISO image of the factory Vivobook. They told me I also had to get the OS from Microsoft directly, who in turn said they couldn't get me a full version Windows 8, but only an upgrade from Windows 7. This meant I had to install Windows 7 first, then upgrade to Windows 8.Now I'm stuck because the BIOS won't let me set the boot order to the USB drive. And, yes, I've flashed it to version 206. IF YOU KNOW HOW TO DO THIS, PLEASE COMMENT.In spite of all the headache, my only advice is to swap for a SSD immediately. 95% of my docs were backed-up but I didn't make an ISO image of the whole system, so I'm paying for it.In the end, I still think this is a good machine which just had 1 cheap part which went bad very quickly. (BTW, the floor model at the store also had the same problem.)","January 22, 2013",
laptops,"Very solid, all around travel companion; great value -- REVISED REVIEW",E. Carbone,R28YJZDVJOL48Y,3,"I purchased this model a couple of weeks ago. I have purchased four Asus netbooks since 2007 and I still have all but the first one I bought (which was still running fine but had become obsolete in many ways, so I donated it). So as you can tell, I was a big fan of Asus netbooks. While the netbook era seems to have ended, I still wanted something that was a lot like a netbook: Highly portable, lightweight, sufficiently powerful to do most anything I need to do on a laptop, highly affordable, and durable enough to be taken on airplanes, to coffee shops, or wherever.This new Asus does the trick!Positives:First of all, at approximately $500, you are going to have difficulty finding this overall set of features and performance in a very small footprint laptop - period. Now if you want to spend $1000 or more, you will get a more upscale set of components elsewhere (including the Asus Zenbook offerings). The question is whether you need or will even notice the better performance. But assuming you like the notion of a modest, $500 investment, the Q200E is very worthy of consideration.The upsides of the Q200E: Very thin profile, weighs less than 3 lbs, nicely responsive 11.6 inch touch screen, runs Windows 8 and applications swiftly, starts up fast (like most of the ""ultrabooks""), solidly built with an aluminum case, very good keyboard - especially for its size, attractive design (looks more expensive than it is), 3 USB ports (1 is 3.0), excellent sound from the speakers (surprisingly, the best I've heard - including from larger, more expensive laptops), a highly portable power adapter (no ""brick"") and a 500 GB hard drive that's more than sufficient.The downsides: The Intel i3 processor (1.8 GHz) is fast enough for anything I might do on this little computer, but folks who have very intensive computing needs will want a higher end, faster processor. Again, for my needs, I haven't experienced any limitations, but I'm not running computer aided design software or creating animation... Also, this unit comes with 4 GB RAM, which is not upgradeable. Would you need more? I don't, but if you think you will, you need a higher end laptop with more RAM or at least expansion capability. As for the screen, it is supposedly HD and I would describe it as ""decent,"" it is simply not the kind of ultra HD screen you will get on a $1500 laptop. But then, if you want that level of resolution, you might also want a 13"" screen or larger so you can really enjoy the advantages. I find that the 11.6"" screen, while an upgrade for me personally from the 9 or 10 inch netbook screens, is still a bit smallish in terms of either serious movie watching or working for more than a few hours at a stretch. The battery life is unfortunately not in the realm of the little Asus netbooks with 6-cell batteries -- this unit has a 2-cell Lithium battery that is good only for 3 to 4 hours. It's also not easy to change it without unscrewing about 10 screws, so this unit will not provide those 6 or 7 hour marathons like the aforementioned netbooks. (If Asus were to come out with a replacement 4-cell battery for this unit, it would be a major upgrade! I'm going to keep my fingers crossed). Finally, I noted that some reviewers commented about the fan running frequently. I can tell you here and now that first of all, once I completed all of the Asus software updates, the fan seemed to run much less often. But regardless, the fan is very quiet. Unless you are working in a sound isolation chamber and are very distractable, believe me -- fan noise is not going to be an issue for you.The verdict: If you are comparing the Q200E to l1 or 13 inch laptops that cost $1000-$1500, you will find it lacking. No surprise! However, if you are not a ""super user"" and evaluate this unit in terms of its $500 price tag, you will be pleased. I give it 4.5 stars!----------------------------------------------REVISED REVIEW -- 2 WEEKS LATER----------------------------------------------Well, I am revisiting this review because about 2 weeks after my original review (and only a month into owning this Asus), the hard drive failed. Up to that point, this little computer worked great -- just as I described above. But one day, upon being shut down, the hard drive made some funny clicking noises. I thought it was strange but paid no heed until the next day, when I tried to power it back on. I could get only the system setup (Bios) screen, and nothing would work from there. Various tests returned messages about System Failure etc. I called Asus technical support, and spent 35 minutes wasting my time with the protocol, only for the tech to conclude what I knew: the hard drive had failed. He directed me back to BestBuy. The technical guy at BestBuy examined the computer to make sure I hadn't tampered with it and he booted it up and checked it out. Same conclusion. Because it was so new, they actually offered me to exchange for a new one, or issue a refund. My confidence in Asus a bit shaken, I took the refund.As a result of my experience, I'm knocking off a star. But I'm not giving an even lower rating because every brand does experience a failure rate. The BestBuy tech told me that it was the first Asus of this type to come back; he noted another brand that he saw returned frequently for failed hard drives (I won't repeat the brand here, since this is basically hearsay). He noted that his experience so far had been that this model Asus (and Asus in general) are quite reliable, but as he pointed out, if they make 100,000 of them and there's a 1% failure rate, that's still a 1000 defective units....So it might still be worth a try, despite my experience. This Asus seemed very solidly built and has a great form factor. It's too bad this happened but you might have better luck. (I decided to go with a higher end Sony Vaio S series 13.3"", which was twice the price, but ultimately had some other features I wanted and stronger performance...so far so good with the Sony Vaio).","December 26, 2012",
laptops,Great Item at the price.,Christopher R. Lock,RMPSC1SBBWTIK,3,"For what you pay you can not get anything better. This unit is lightweight with sufficient hardware for day to day office application processing needs. As well as online media content streaming, HD movie play back (used a usb blu-ray drive,)web browsing, and gaming via Onlive. I would not recommend this unit for hardcore processing (adobe after affects would run out of memory). However for gaming needs you can get a subscription to Onlive games and get all the new titles there. The Onlive servers render graphics etc so a perfect solution for the budget conscious student as well. Screen can be a little small so I would recommend getting a monitor and extra power adapter for that home location. Memory isn't upgradeable it is soldered on the board. Hard drive is only thing you can upgrade. I would recommend upgrading to an ssd to get a huge jump in performance. You can even get an external housing for the drive it comes with for 20 bucks and turn it into a portable usb drive. Make sure you get a housing for a 2.5 drive with no external power connection requirements, and you will want one that only uses one usb port. Has touchscreen and that is a MUST for windows 8. If you are in the market and considering a cheaper bigger unit with no touch screen do not do it you will regret it. Windows 8 is hard to navigate with out a touch screen.... well more of a P.I.T.A. But you get the drift.*Update*I am writing this update for all ASUS products as this is not a product specific advisory but it is a technical support advisory. I have deducted 2 stars from this rating that would otherwise be a 5 as all products performance and pricing wise have been 5 star devices. The issue at hand is technical support/consumer service. As we all know no device is worth the components it is made with if you can not get ANY kind of help should you require it.The situation:I purchased an $1,100 phone manufactured by ASUS from an online company that is based in Chicago (the device is a WORLD WIDE phone). I received this VERY EXPENSIVE phone and for a week have had no 4G service. The fastest I get is 2G signal (not satisfactory for this price). I contacted ASUS US technical support today attempting to get some help. The only thing I got was number to call in CHINA as a US version has not been released. I am 20% ok with that answer and here is why. I had an extremely advanced question (I did not expect a resolution but I thought I would ask) and a VERY VERY BASIC question. Basic on the level of this is probably something the FAQ's probably just have not been updated to reflect (How to access the service menu). The technicians should have access to this information through an intranet KB shared via asus corporate servers at the very least. Secondly referring a consumer to make an international support phone call is LUDICROUS this day and age. I was a corporate trainer for a good amount of years and can assure everyone it is VERY possible to route an 800 number call over the internet using an Avaya or equivalent switch to an international location. I know this because we routed calls from the US to the Philippians ALL the time like it was water flowing into a glass...Think about it the next time you call tech support and you obviously are talking to someone international do you think that company is paying anything more than 2 cents for your entire call, if that? They are not so this is just BAD consumer service and support. I will no longer purchase an ASUS product until I can be assured that when the name says ASUS on the box ASUS stands behind it.","May 26, 2013",
laptops,"Cheap but fragile notebook, as expected from ASUS",KIET N.,R3GFUL2N2NVWW9,3,"The product is the CHEAPEST touch-screen laptop on the market.With an i3 Intel CPU, integrated graphic, 500Gb HDD, Bluetooth v4.0, nice touch and quite good looking, it is a big bargain for its price. Another plus for this laptop is the fact that its sound system is incredible! The sound is incredibly deep to be found on a cheap laptop. USB 3.0 port helps data transferring.One big con might be Window 8. Window 8 Metro interface offer a very poor choice of apps, thus not very usable. And as you will spend most of your time in the desktop, the touch screen won't be of much use. And the fact that the keyboard is kinda ""in the way"", touch experience won't be as incredible as a tablet would offer.Despite being cheap, the laptop is not very popular, so don't expect to be able to find accessories, like keyboard cover, screen protector, fitted case, for it.One big trouble that many previous reviews have mentioned is the touchpad. But if you buy the laptop after reading this review, don't worry about it! ASUS has updated the driver and solved that problem.The build...is not as great as it looks. At first, the laptop looks incredibly solid, with aluminum premium build. However, sadly, it is just coated in aluminum. The metal skin is too THIN! So thin that it might have been better for ASUS to stick to plastic. A slight bum will leave a dent on your laptop! EVEN IF IT IS INSIDE A CASE (Case Logic case)! So if you are expecting a solid aluminum build like those of expensive ultrabook, MacBook, you will be disappointed. Luckily, ASUS has 1-year- accidental warranty so you only have to put up with the dents and scratches.As you do your research, you probably will find out that there are 2 versions of this notebook, Q200E and X202E. Get this one, cause the difference in performance is huge! If you can afford to fork out another hundred bucks, go for the S400, with the i5 CPU. It is worth it! But don't expect the build to be any better!","April 20, 2013",
laptops,Bad Asus touchpad driver. Try to get your Vivobook from the MS Store,"unif ""unif""",RR4PH983BYOUD,3,"I recently bought the Vivobook from Tigerdirect, but through Amazon for $429.99. After first turning it on, the laptop went through the standard Windows 8 setup. The touchpad worked fine and I was delighted to find that two-finger scrolling on the touchpad worked great. Two-finger scrolling can be very convenient for those times when it's not as comfortable to scroll by touching the screen and when your fingers are on the touchpad anyway. As well, the touchpad wasn't overly sensitive, so it did not interfere as I was typing on the keyboard.But then I started getting automatic updates from Asus. Many of them. I would have to restart the computer and wait several minutes for everything to install. This happened three times and after the third time, two-finger scrolling no longer worked and the touchpad was overly sensitive to the point where I could barely type a sentence without something wacky happening due to the interference from my palm being close to the touchpad as I typed away.Also, I was video chatting with my friend when the video feed started behaving erratically, which never used to happen when I used my old laptop to video chat.Keyboard felt kind of cramped, but one can get used to it. The core i3 processor can make things lag a bit when you have several tabs open and a video chat going at the same time. Fan seems to be on constantly. Again, no biggie, one can get used to it. Touchscreen worked great, and I loved the small form factor, and small weight.Due to all of the above (but especially due to the badly updated Asus touchpad driver), I decided to return the laptop. For some reason, neither Amazon's nor Tigerdirect's website had any record of the transaction, so I had to call Tigerdirect for instructions on how to return the laptop. I was on hold for about half an hour before I finally spoke to someone. He told me I needed to call Asus to get a case number and then call back Tigerdirect to get an Return Authorization Number so that I could return the laptop. Of course, I had to wait another half hour to speak to someone from Tigerdirect. In the end, I paid $21 to ship the laptop back to them.So the lesson is: Try to buy the Vivobook directly from the Microsoft Store if you can. My friend got her Vivobook from the MS Store and it has absolutely no issues, no series of Asus updates forced upon you, and no bloatware. Sure, you'll pay a bit more (last time I checked, the MS Store had it for $499), but it's worth it.","March 11, 2013",

laptops,"Good value for the price, but not for the picky audience...",C. CHOU,R2YDYGBTL4E4UA,3,"Disclaimer: I will try to review it without touching the Windows 8 and touch screen, as those seem to be preferences... This is not my personal laptop and mine is not from a fruit company brand. My review is purely from the surface value of playing with it one evening.One of my relative got this laptop and wanted to upgrade to SSD. First of all, there is no hardware maintenance manual published. I then proceeded down adventure with my Craftsman 41649. While attempting to open the back of the case, it was discovered that the screws on the back of the unit are unevenly torqued where some are very easy to undo but some are tough to get out. Material used for the screws are of bad quality where the ones that are tough to get out sustained a little damage in the Philips slots. The screws are still very much functional, just unsightly with some gauged lips and silver exposing.After the upgrade, I have attempted to make provisioning for the SSD and found that I am unable to use the touchpad as the cursor jumps all over the screen. It had turned out that one MUST touch the laptop else where in order for the touch pad to function reliably. This mitigates the possibility of using the laptop while standing up (browsing through recipes while cooking...etc). The touch screen works well. The hinges are flimsy with non-linear effort when opening and closing, never-the-less, in line with most in the price range.Overall, the mechanical design and execution of this laptop is a mess; however, it is a good value and a fact hard to argue against. As long as you are not picky, I can see this to be a rewarding purchase for under $400.","May 4, 2013",

But then one day discovered a screw where I was sitting (it had fallen off the bottom of the laptop)... replaced the screw, and things have been better. Guessing the loose hardware was causing flaky connectivity.Things have been better for the last week or so... the touch screen is great, Windows 8 would not have been my first choice, but I'm getting use to it.

I gave it 3 stars, however, for a couple of issues I've been having with it.PROS:LightweightHas touchscreen allows for much easier navigation through Windows 8The graphics card and processor are strong enough to run Far Cry 3, Tomb Raider, Call of Duty, Battlefield 3, and a ton of other games on low or medium settings.Boots up insanely fast Very stylish, reminiscent of the Macbook line.CONS:Bad wifi reception (this is killing me, i only get two to three bars in my room, whereas my old Toshiba laptop gets 5. I did some research and came to the conclusion that because of the metal body, It doesnt pick up the signal as well as the plastic toshiba. Still, VERY annoying.)Fingerprint magnet on both the inside and outside, I literally clean it every day so it looks nice when I use it.All in all, great value machine for the price, but the wifi thing is killing me and I'm slowly getting used to it.","August 3, 2013",
laptops,Really wanted to like it.,KB,R17OI7A29Z77WL,3,"My main problem was with the wifi and the touchpad. The wifi would randomly drop the connection. I could sit there with my phone and/or ipad right next to the laptop and they would be connecting fine. Couldn't find drivers that would work. Also the ""touch"" aspect of the touch pad seemed to come and go. Sometimes it would work fine, other times it didn't seem to recognize that I was touching it. That was pretty annoying. I ended up returning it. Like I said, I really wanted to like it, but ultimately I was disappointed.","June 6, 2013",

After running it for just a few hours though I started running into problems. The computer was unstable. I looked in the event log and random processes were crashing. Some of the issues seemed to be with the MacAfee. I tried uninstalling that, but it didn't do a clean uninstall and left some windows services running even after uninstalling. At this point I decided to give it one more try and just start with a clean version of Windows 8.1 RTM. So far it has been running great without a single hiccup for the last 3 days. Also figuring out how to boot to a USB drive to re install is quite tricky too but some searching on Google revealed the magic BIOS settings to do that.

But after that one message it hasn't happened again, so I guess we'll see where that goes.To be fair, I'd probably give it 4 stars if it didn't have Windows 8 (I f-ing HATE Windows 8).

I wouldn't have gotten one for myself. There are limits to what you can do with a chromebook. Of course it isn't a full OS laptop so its limits are within expectations, yet some are very bothersome. I'm just going to list the Pros and Cons for my Acer Chromebook.Pros: Fast start up, decent battery life, integrated google doc, drive and app support. Decent entry level specs for the price. Low price. Light and mobile unit. Has offline mode (in the case of no internet), 4 usb portsCons: offline mode isn't the best, limited productivity apps and behind software titans Microsoft Office and Apple's Keynote, very little storage.The biggest con for me is the printing. I need to print all the time. Google cloud print is difficult to use, and doesn't support commercial office printers, which is what we have. So either you have to buy a special google cloudprint ready printer, or use their Print share..which is finicky, has a very simplistic driver and often messes up my print margins.Since I got it for free, I'll use it, because it is definitely lighter than my macbook pro. However I wish chrome would/could somehow add driver support, because the printing is a dealbreaker for my personal use.I wouldn't recommend this as a primary computer alternative to anyone, it's more like a tablet streamlined for production, with an included keyboard and usb ports. It can be useful if you already have a laptop, and want a lighter one for on-the-go needs.","May 1, 2013",
laptops,This is the $199 Chromebook with 2GB extra memory and a big slow hard drive,R. Tupelo Schneck,R237LR8XPI2023,3,"Update, December 2013: at this point, almost all users should get the Acer C720 Chromebook instead of any of the C710 models.I love Chromebook and I love the Acer C7; see my big review at Acer C710-2833 Chromebook or Acer C7 C710-2847 Chromebook.However, *this* Acer C7 version is not the Chromebook for most users. Most users should get the Acer C710-2833 Chromebook for $199 instead. There are two changes in this Acer C710-2487: (1) 2GB extra memory for a total of 4GB; and (2) a 320GB spinning hard drive instead of a 16GB SSD. Don't let the sizes fool you, the spinning hard drive is a significant downgrade in performance, and a larger hard drive offers little benefit on Chromebook for most users. The extra memory is good, but probably not worth the extra money; and one of the big benefits of the Acer C7 is that it is easy to upgrade yourself.(If you're really keen on the big slow noisy hard drive, you might see if the Acer C7 C710-2847---note the ever so slightly different product number---can be found cheaper. It has only 2GB memory instead of 4GB.)Note that this is not the Acer C7 with the longer-life battery! You need the $250 Acer C710-2826, or the $280 Acer C710-2055 or Acer C710-2815, or the $300 Acer C710-2605 for that.","March 20, 2013",

laptops,"Good laptop, keyboard is terrible",Dan,R3RSA9Y1HB7GIT,3,"Summary:Responsive, solid build, lightweight, bad keyboardKeyboard:Uses a chicklet style keyboard that looks aesthetically pleasing. Keys are not responsive and require the press to be hard and directly in the center to register. Pressing the key on a corner (even to the point it looks fully depressed) will not register. Not at all suitable for heavy typing work.Touchpad:Large and responsive. With two finger scrolling and enhancement, I found myself using the mousepad far more than the touchscreen.Touchscreen:Responsive, but honestly not nearly as useful as I anticipated. In almost all situations, it's easier to just use the pad for clicking/scrolling than reaching over the keyboard to press something. I did not use any illustration software, but the multi-touch capability seemed responsive. Honestly, if I were go through the purchase process again, I'd go for something without the touchscreen.Performance:Works fast, but still a little slower than I anticipated. I chalk it up to the extra power needed for the touchscreen. Also had it randomly shut off on me without warning a couple times at 50%+ battery power remaining.Battery:I can get anywhere from 3-6 hours depending on use. A single word document at low brightness gets me 6 hours, while multiple browsing tabs/programs or video only gets me 3.WIFI:After reading other reviews I made sure the first thing I did was update drivers, so WIFI has worked great for me. In some cases it seemed more responsive than my desktop that I keep plugged directly into the router.","April 17, 2013",

If you can afford it, I would recommend you to get one with higher resolution. Touch screen is good.Sound - GoodCamera - Year 2003 like camera in 2013 laptop, bad.Keyboard - It is different. I don't type a lot in this laptop, I don't have any problem with it and no issues with space bar either. (I use my right thump for space bar)Touch pad - Good, but it will drive you nuts until you disable these options - zoom, rotate, all 'three finger' options and 'Edge gestures'. Left and right clicks are stiff.Wifi - Stable, full signal. My router is like 20ft away from me, there are two walls in-between, no drops so far.Windows 8 / 8.1 - I couldn't update to 8.1 immediately, had to install updates for 8 first. But windows updates did not work for me, tried lot of fixes and it finally worked and then I upgraded it 8.1. Total time spent for this process - 10+ hours. I'm using traditional desktop mode, so it is kind of similar to windows 7. (If you are a technical person - windows 8+ allocates memory like there is no tomorrow)Design - I like it, it is thin and light weight.Battery - 4.30 hours for normal browsing (news, YouTube, social networking and etc)Running temperature - A little bit warm near the screen ( fan vent is there) and warm near the battery when it is charging. You won't feel it until you purposefully check it.Noise level - It is normally quite, but heavier operations like virus scan make the fans sound like a mini hair drier. Sometimes there is a clicking sound from hard disk (click - wait 10 seconds - click - wait 10 seconds - click and on). It stops after few minutes. Internet says it is normal for Hitachi disks, I have to wait and see.Finger print magnet? - Yes and Yes. Especially the dark lid area behind the screen, clearly visible.Value for money? - I think so.It has been four days since I started using this laptop, I'll update if I find anything new.","December 15, 2013",

laptops,"Maybe a 2, maybe a 4. I had to split the difference.",Mark Freeman,R26NT2HWUZGFH7,3,"This was a difficult computer to review and I struggled as to how to rate it given the price point at which it is sold. I gave it 3 stars out of 5, with the price point being the only thing that almost pushed me to 4. If it weren't for the price, I would honestly put this more toward 2. Overall, it is a very low end laptop that doesn't seem to know whether it wants to be a laptop, a netbook, or a tablet. One note, I have broken down a separate section for Windows 8. While I don't blame the manufacturer for the issues, when you buy a laptop, you are buying the OS also. As a buyer, you need to be aware of what you are getting.The good:- The screen, while small, is actually very pretty. It has nice resolution and a strong display. It is very bright and easy to read. Text is crisp.- The touch screen seems sensitive enough that I don't feel like I have to push through the screen.- Overall, the computer is very light weight. Given its size, this is no surprise.- The keyboard feels pretty nice. It has the modern chicklet style keys and although they feel a little cheap, typing is quite easy on this device. It is a full size keyboard. Given the size of the computer, this is really nice.- The rubber pads on the bottom of the computer are very non-slip.- It comes with a 500GB HD and 6GB of RAM.- The touchpad is responsive.- Supports 2 finger scroll.- Backlit keys.- Came with an external monitor adapter.The bad:- The plug is very large and takes up more than one spot on a power strip or battery backup. It looks like it was made to have exchangeable outlets, but I often struggle to find plug space and taking up two plugs is unacceptable to me.- The batter is garbage. I booted up the computer and let it sit without using it. In 3 hours and 30 minutes, the batter was close to 20% left. THIS IS WITHOUT USING THE COMPUTER! Given that the battery is so bad, it will need to stay plugged in almost constantly.- Slow charging time.- No built in ethernet adapter. A separate connector must be purchased.- The base of the computer feels very cheap compared to the screen. I would be scared to accidentally drop this computer.- The trackpad is very, very cheaply made with too much play.- No media drive. However, this is becoming more and more common.Windows 8 is hands down the worst version of Windows I have ever used. It takes forever to boot the computer to a working state. I found it difficult to find even the most common of task, like logging off and shutting down. If you are buying a Windows PC any time in the next year or two, this really, really needs to be a consideration you make.The saving grace for this laptop is the price point. Acer seems to know this is the low of the low end. It is mass produced cheaply and reflects that fact well. If you are looking for a cheap little laptop to take on vacation or if your computer use consist of only surfing the web or maybe occasionally playing some music or movies, this will probably do it for you.

An ""Administrators"" account is a backdoor route viruses/malware uses get in and cause unrecoverable distruction to your data. With Admin rights those malware can easily infect deep within your ""recovery partitions'! meaning, these's not turning back and you're royally screwed. Theres many more problems that can happen but I think you already get my point.GOALS: 1) Don't use your Main MS Account as an"" Adminitrator"" but instead ""standard"" 2) Create a secondary account called ""local account"" and set that up as the Administrator instead.Account Management: steps creating a local account(administrator) and MS Account(standard)Charms search: type""control panel"" > ""User's Accounts and Family Safety"" > ""Remove User account"" > "" Add a new user in PC settings "" located at bottom of window > Bringing you to Metro > click ""add Account"" > ""Sign in without MS accout"" located at bottom of page > ""Local Accout"" > create new user name and PWYou have 2 options on Signing IN1) Microsoft account or 2) Local Account1) Create or sign in with your MAIN Microsoft Account. If you already an MS account or uses windows phones/ xbox live or Hotmail/live/MSN email address you can use these as well to link those services to 1 master MS Account.2) Create a Local Account. Thise secondary account will not connect to MS's ecosytem but only in your local computer. I identical to USERS login on Windows 7,Vista,XP etc.Once you've setup these two accounts, you must set each account type to: >Change ACCOUNT TYPE for Main MS Account to ""Standard""Change ACCOUNT TYPE for 2ndary Local Account to ""Administrator""Please do these steps, it only takes 5minutes. Its a small price to pay considering, it may potentially rescue your entire data from a completely erasing your data after sending it for repairs.__________________________________________________________________________Making Back ups/ EtcAnother tip is to make a recovery image.First install Setup all your programs , setup your custom settings, etcAfter personalizing your PC. > Its time to Create a Recovery Image right after you've set everything up. This image will allow you to revert back to this pc's state in time, and in perfect working order.Sometimes system recovery doesn't solve your problems so having secondary backup plan like Recovery Image is key.________________________________________________________________________Not optional, must practice these 3 regular computing habits.#1 (Install McAfee Antivirus, which is now free starting 2014, per Intel's 2014 Keynote at CES) or Paid programs such as Kaspersky Internet Security 2014 is the leading software in the market today. $50. These programs scans your system automatically, so set it and forget it.#2 (Install MalwareBytes/free, scan your pc every month with this program or sooner when you feel like your system is sluggish or seeing webpages poping up that you didnt click) Because this is a free software, as a user you must manually start the scaning process or by buying retail version you'll unlock the auto scan scheduler feature.#3 (Install Superantispyware/free, Scan pc every 2wks)Because this is a free software, as a user you must manually start the scaning process or by buying retail version you'll unlock the auto scan scheduler feature.Its ok skip a few scans between months, although not advisable, especially if your a heavy web surfing maniac spending 2-3 hrs daily websurfing not just facebooking. But please dont go without using all 3 programs more than 5-8 Months in between scans.________________________________________________________________________Another way to avoid spreading your personal information out there into the wild unknowingly is to un-google yourself.yes ladies and gents! google or yahoo especially yahoo LOL..... but google is key here.Microsoft sells Primarily Software.Apple sells Primarily HardwareGoogle sells neither, that's why their products are so CHEAP, once they suckered in their backdoor ridden ecosystem, Google Inc. sells Primarily Everything about YOU!_____________________________________________________________________________________________________Steps in upgrading from Windows 8 to Windows 8.1 (2-3hrs)Key here is to ensure your windows 8 is fully updated before upgrading to win8.1Therefore repeatedly ""check of updates"" on windowsHow to upgrade to windows 8.1 for dummies.Step 1: Go to Metro and not desktopStep 2: Start typing : ""Control Panel""Step 3: Click ""Windows Update"" > ""Check for Update""Step 4: install updatesStep 5: restart computerStep 6: Repeat step 1 -5 until result ""no more updates""Step 7: Run HP Update client, install all updates from HP to ensure all drivers and bugfixes are updated.( or whichever OEM you may have, lenovo,dell, sony etc.)Step 8: Uninstall your Antivirus Software (important) then RESTART PCStep 9: Go to Windows Store and upgrade to 8.1Step 10: leave computer on for 2hrs as it upgrades.Step 11: Repeat Steps 1 - 7Step 12: if you're not a complete fool, 8.1 upgrade should be straight forward. \After steps 1-8 ONLY THEN you should install WIndows 8.1 at the marketplace. Goodluck.(note: steps above removes a lot of failures users experience after 8.1 update)___________________________________________________________Not many want to shell out their dollars on Office 360 if all they intend of using is standard word processors.you can use a free web version of office calledBing.com search: ""MS Office Web Apps""just sign in with the same MS Account user name used on your PC.","January 27, 2014",

laptops,Good value. Beware the trackpad issues.,Marcela Mendez,R3DJ4PRZOWQZRB,3,"I bought this Acer computer in October last year. I have to say it's a great value, it is fast enough for normal everyday computing needs (browsing, emailing), and it's a good looking thing, very stylish design.The shortcoming though, is its trackpad. As many more reviews say, it's unresponsive at times, not sensitive enough and sometimes inaccurate. I had to cope with it for a couple of months (wasn't a very big deal because the touchscreen helps a lot) before I decided to return it to Amazon. As always, Amazon gave me the best possible customer service and a refund was issued to my account the very next day.I wouldn't say this is a reason to underestimate Acer as a brand, they make some really nice computers and airways seem to aim for the lowest possible price point. Most of them are great value for the money. I had two Acer laptops before this one, and the one I just bought (with the money from the refund) is an Acer.Bottom line: this is a great value for the money and if it wasn't for the malfunctioning trackpad I would definitely still be using it, and I would have rated it 4 or even 5 stars.","April 13, 2014",

laptops,One important weakness..,A Fernando,R3359P74KIIOLJ,3,"As a user of an older Acer Aspire One Netbook, ""almost"" everything about this v5-122p netbook is better.PROs1. A bit larger screen w/ slightly better colors, though less bright.2. Larger keyboard though the keys are louder, a bit spongy and harder to press compared to the Aspire One.3. The much, much better speakers! They sound decent compared to the very awful speakers of the Aspire One.4. Physically much better looking netbook with a slightly thinner profile.5. The 4 GB installed memory is very sensible6. Large disk spaceCons1. It's significantly heavier compared to the One2. Quite noticeable hiss and whine of the CPU fan which is like that 95% of the time.3. The Mcafee pre-installed software. Though I'm sure it will protect the people from viruses and malware, it's just slows the computer to a level of annoyance. I advice uninstallation and let the built-in antivirus Windows Defender do the job.4. I don't find value of Windows 8 which is slower than Win 7, except maybe, as a more secure OS. Support for *.ISO files.5. One glaring weakness, the very slow AMD A4-1250 cpu. Internet browsing is less responsive compared to the Aspire One. Youtube videos are a bit laggy. It is compounded by Windows 8 with all the unnecessary bells and whistles which, as a savvy user, I have to configure to lessen its negative impact on system performance.Summary:A very decent netbook/laptop and nothing much to complain about except the very slow CPU which is the AMD A4-1250 which is I ""feel"" a one step back from Intel Atom n2600. I recommend choosing the faster available CPUs for this device.","December 1, 2013",

laptops,"After Complications, I think this is going to be a good Notebook",James Zuidema,R3PXV1G891ITGY,3,"REVIEW UPDATED:So I just went through a form with Amazon to do a full refund after a month with the computer. This is due to the requirements for the computer. I could not justify the price for what it is. For schoolwork, it is just too big. For gaming, it is not good enough for the price. This computer was the envy of my friends and I truly did love it and will be sad to see it go away...I am going to take my money and invest it into a very cheap and heavily discounted Asus X202 touch laptop or similar laptop for school, use the excess money to get two solid state drives, one for my new laptop and one for my desktop. I will also get new ram for my desktop as well as a next gen graphics card that so far is future proof. The rest of the money will be thrown towards a PS4 or Xbox One and will take a significant chunk out of them making it easier to get them when they release.This way I get a computer that is more practical for school, and two very powerful game systems that blow this laptop out of the water.I will truly miss it, it is a great laptop and I recommend it to anybody with a much bigger disposable income. I'm truly sad to see it go.Oh, also it had battery trouble and would not keep charge after a month of use. Thats just one more reason.BELOW IS MY OLDER REVIEW:Ok, so for about the past 3 months I've been researching various laptops at around 1k for my first year of college.This was the first one to have everything I wanted-4th gen Haswell Quad CoreGood enough battery lifeTouch Screen at 1920x1080A good enough dedicated graphics card (gt750m)The reason i give this 3 stars are because of various flaws I found with it.The first one I ordered got here in a day. It was a amazing computer, well built, good audio, great screen, battery life. The nvida card was giving me trouble and after a session of Crysis 2, the gt750m's driver reported error code 043, which essentially means it died. I sent it back and got a new one same day from amazon and starting dealing with new issues.My new issues were the 5400rpm hard-drive and the networking card.The HDD is just too slow for my tastes, I've grown up on 7200rpm emachines and have a OCZ solid state drive in my desktop. it is simply too slow and I plan on replacing it if I can stay within warranty.The Networking card (Qualcom Artheros Ar9485wb-eg) is also really slow. It takes a full minute to download 1000kb of data. Both the original and the replacement had this issue. i use either wired now or use a usb wifi adapter. Again if I can manage to stay within warranty I will replace it with something better.Now for the better stuff.I really like the gt750m nvidia card, it can handle most games at the same graphics of today's 7th gen consoles. The most taxing game I have are Planetside 2, it is playable in big battles on very low settings at full resolution but at any other settings it is iffy. I can manage 40-50 frames at these settings. I played left 4 dead 2 and that was eaten up. The optimus technology automatically switched to the HD 4600 integrated card in the cpu when I played Halo Combat Evolved at Maximum settings in a close quarters unlimited grenades and rockets 16 player match, the integrated card chewed it up. I haven't tried Crysis 2 on the replacement model yet.Build quality feels like a very fine aluminum, almost like plastic but very solid, I like it.Screen is the best I have ever had, it is beautiful.Keyboard, I didn't like the fact it is silver but it is easy to type on and although the backlit bleeds a lot, it does make it easier to see the actual keys and not just the letters.Mouse pad is the best I have used. Does not mess up your cursor if you accidentally touch it when typing papers like on some notebooks.Audio is good for a notebook, the additional subwoofer is weak and I forgo it for my cheap gogroove speakers.Battery life may sound average at 5 hours but it is very generous, when it says 3 hours and 19 minutes it really does mean that much time is left if you keep using how you are. Other notebooks seem to have a less accurate timing.Not too much bloatware, easily removed within five minutes.All in all i give it 3 stars because my first model failed and it has a slow HDD and crappy network card.Pros:Full HD IPS Touch Screen with great anglesGood keyboard although blandGreat mousepadgt750m handles modern games well and is capable at low settings select next gen titlesbattery life is generousCPU is powerful when on high performance modegood audio for a notebookCons: SLLLLOOOOOOOWWWWWW HDD at 5400rpm (upgradable)Crappy network card that WILL frustrate you (upgradable)Maybe a little big to bring into classes?First models gt750m died on me","August 24, 2013",
laptops,Great laptop but also physical issues,Judit,R16R9SZLQ6LG58,3,"I bought this laptop to replace my now 3-year-old Macbook Pro. In all aspects this is a much superior computer (from CPU, RAM, to HDD space (both the Mac and this are 5400RPM)). So that's the pro.Now for the cons: my first N550JV came with the spacebar not fully functioning. It did not register a key press when pressing it about 1/2"" in from the left side. The optical drive trey also did not align flush with the rest of the case, causing it to get caught on anything from my clothing to my skin (ouch).I contacted Amazon and asked for a replacement. Well, the second N550JV arrived with the spacebar fully functional. The optical drive trey still wasn't perfect, but looking at 180-degree views online, it seems to be an issue with all N550JVs (not that that's justifiable).But, the big issue with the replacement was the dead pixels on my screen.I might have just been unlucky, getting 2 defective devices, but what are the odds? Not to mention, for a $1000+ laptop, I would expect a much higher quality product.","November 19, 2013",
laptops,Unfortunately had to return,Kylie Landrey,RY6WX433B8V77,3,"I purchased this laptop for an intensive Master of Architecture program, so would need a laptop that could support 3-d modeling software and adobe suit programs, among others, running simultaneously. I wanted to love this computer.pros:AttractiveHas DVD driveGreat touch screenBacklit keyboardLightweight for its sizeDecent battery lifeGreat soundHowever, over the course of the 4 months I owned the laptop, the malfunctions were too significant to overlook.Cons:Many dead pixels on screen from day 1Could not run rendering software without freezing and shutting downHad many glitches running adobe suite programs and even using adobe reader (even after troubleshooting with Adobe and Windows)Graphics card did not workThe last straw:During the weeks leading up to my semester review I used the laptop heavily, with many programs running at once. It should have been able to withstand the stress, as a ""powerful"" new laptop. I took great care of it, never dropped it or spilled anything on it. After that period of intensive use the keyboard stopped functioning properly. The ""n"" key, ""b"" key, space bar, left shift key, enter key, and ctrl key stuck most of the time (very frustrating).I Initially purchased this laptop due to the many positive reviews, and specs that indicated a powerful, attractive laptop for the price. I was disappointed that the build quality was so poor. Even my college laptop (now 5.5 year-old Sony VAIO) still has a keyboard that functions flawlessly. I decided to return the Asus and go with the more powerful Dell XPS 15. It is more expensive, but hopefully worth the difference in price for a more reliable, lasting product.Bottom line:With some improvements I could have loved this computer. However, because of the extent of major issues I experienced, I was not willing to risk getting the laptop serviced and then going back to school (where I have no time to send product back) and having something else go wrong.","January 10, 2014",

It seems to have loosened/gotten better, but it's still more difficult than most.-Grainy webcam.-Hard Drive pre-partitioned into 333GB OS, 537 GB for Data-bad keyboard layout: very small directional pad in order to accommodate a very small numberpad-blocky charger-Short battery life (3 hours)-Disk data transfer rate (5400 rpm hard drive)-Seems to freeze on resume sometimes (just displays start screen background with ability to log in)-Windows 8My main issues have been with the battery life and the Wifi. So far, using both the Windows and Power4Gear Power Saver Settings, I have not been able to get the claimed ""5.5 hours life."" At best, running few applications and using PowerSaver I can get about 3 hours of life. In terms of the wifi, the connections I get are very slow and the WiFi Card doesn't support the bands to see my university's N networks (despite the claim of support for bgn).In terms of Ratings, if you care for the Windows Experience Index, it has a 7.9 in RAM and Processor Power, a 6.8 in Graphics and Gaming Graphics, and is held down to 5.9 overall by a 5.9 in hard disk data transfer rate. I haven't put the laptop through its paces in terms of performance, but I have written a few programs and watched videos with no problems.

I question why they didn't have an SSD come with this laptop, but I ended up buying one and installing it--which was rather easy to do. Installing windows 7 was a pain due to the lack of drivers for win7 on the ASUS website. I had to dig around the internet until I found a forum post that someone graciously made that had a list of all the drivers you needed as well as a setting in win7 that needed to be enabled to make them work with win 7.

laptops,Better than what I had but doesn't live up to expectations...,"R. Duke ""Astromechanic""",R3LZCKVCGDKSJ9,3,"I bought this at Best Buy because they qualified me for 18-month interest free financing which Amazon unfortunately didn't since I would of rather bought from them if they had... Anyways, while this does at least run games like Far Cry 3 and Skyrim on medium settings which my MBP running Windows 7 with Intel 3000HD could only hope to run with everything low (& still lag), I am disappointed with the performance. I have updated all the drivers, but yet I still experience lag even on medium settings. This is disappointing as before I upgraded my desktop to a GTX 670 FTW, it was running just a regular GTX 650 with no overclock and even it would run before mentioned games on high settings with zero lag. The GTX 765M supposedly tested higher on 3dMark than the GTX 650 desktop card, but real game performance shows significantly less performance. I checked and the computer is utilizing the GTX 765M and not integrated Intel 4000HD (which is permanently disabled on this particular model). I can't say how this laptops performs relative to other laptops in its price range or how other people maybe got it to perform better, but it definitely hasn't lived fully up to my expectations... I am going to continue Internet research and tinkering, but I am thinking about looking into return options. Since I got it from Best Buy instead of Amazon, I have a feeling I will probably just have to make the best of it. Which isn't all that bad, as this is still a working decent laptop, it's just been a kind of disappointing experience compared to what I was expecting based on benchmarks and other people's reviews.","November 17, 2013",

laptops,Touchpad almost unusable,Eric Warren,RUOEIZPV1JLV7,3,"I bought this to replace my Asus eeePc that I owned for several years. That computer was excellent - long battery life, worked well and had plenty of computing power for what I used it for. This one works fairly well, however the battery life is considerably shorter and I've had more problems with it. I am a fairly novice Ubuntu user, but am familiar. When the computer arrived, I immediately updated to the latest version of Ubuntu, which took a couple of days to get through. When I was done, the computer did not suspend (still doesn't) and the touchpad was very touchy (jumps every time I go to click by tapping the touchpad - usually resulting in clicking on the wrong thing). I contacted Asus support - they were fairly quick to respond, but the only advice they could give me (for both of these problems) was to reinstall the operating system (reverting to the one that came installed). Since I had considerable time invested in updating this, I wasn't so inclined... Since others have had the same experience with the touchpad, I am led to believe that it is not a software issue. I am using a mouse with the computer when practical, other times it is enough of an annoyance to make me wish I had shelled out more for a better computer, but not enough to make me give it up yet.I did have the screen fail on me (not sure what happened) and I sent the laptop off to Asus for repair - they were quick to respond, repair and send it back to me in good working order.

Or the number of times I would try to side by side multitask only to have one app die before launching (e.g. opening a pdf from a web page or image from an email). Although it only has a Celeron (albeit a modern architecture - just Intel keeps using Celeron as their low end brand) the biggest issue seems to be the 2G RAM and slow HDD. The RAM is soldered down so not upgradeable and unlike most laptops, upgrading the HDD is a pain - no single screw panel, you have to take the whole base off to access anything. It's built more like an old netbook, for cost saving no doubt.However, there is a partial workaround for the perf - readyboost is still in Windows 8 so plugging in a USB memory stick (at least 4G) and enabling readyboost through the properties has made a noticeable improvement, still not perfect but at least it's useable now.","May 30, 2014",

laptops,Adequate,Allen C.,R1F0EF5P4UPVZC,3,"I've had Dells for about 10 years including a 17"" Studio that I really like. This 15"" Inspiron is an updated replacement. Since I've used Apple products since the mid-80's, as well, the Windows 8 OS didn't really give me much trouble, although I still use my Windows 7 desktop configuration for most things. As far as I can tell the touchscreen function is mostly fluff but it's handy some of the time.Things I like: It's light weight but still has a large touch screen, the battery life is pretty good, it doesn't get hot, and I can still run my old photo processing program from earlier Dells.Things I don't like: The Windows 8 search function for the computer is not as useful as the old one- it really doesn't let you search the entire computer. The left click key on the touchpad is extremely noisy and doesn't have the same feel as the other keys. Often, if the cursor gets near- not on- the right side of the screen the touch menu pops out and keeps coming back as you repeatedly dismiss it until the cursor is safely moved away. Its a hassle and a distraction.Other than the above, the Inspiron works well enough on its own but whenever Microsoft, Firefox or Thunderbird has an update it suddenly starts behaving erratically- freezing up, grinding slowly at loading, sometimes the cursor disappears altogether and the touchscreen doesn't respond. My email system will go belly up. A lot of this is Windows 8, no doubt, but it's part of this laptop so Dell gets some of the blame for it, too.In the end this is an adequate, inexpensive laptop that does everything I need but it also has some aggravating quirks that my 5 year old Studio 17 did not suffer from.","November 4, 2013",
laptops,Decent budget laptop,J. Harley,R3RUCXCOCJFRV6,3,"I scooped up one of these up during a Black Friday lightning deal. I like it a lot, but it's definitely a budget laptop. The build is all plastic and gaps around the edges suggest they are banging these things out at a rabid pace. When I plug in the AC adapter, I can see the metal of the adapter end through the gap between the outer and inner shell. The touchscreen works well for the most part, although there were a few occasions where responsiveness was less than optimal and I resorted to the mouse. Touch reponsiveness is not as smooth and fluid as with a tablet, which I find odd. You would think if they can get touch responsiveness perfect on a wafer thin tablet, it should be a slam dunk on a full-blown PC. The 1366x768 resolution is sufficient but far from pretty. It's strictly a utilitarian resolution. The screen is also a little dim and has less contrast than I prefer.The gesture capable mouse is okay but like the touchscreen, seems to be hit or miss at times. Sometimes I can tap the mousepad to make a selection, other times it won't respond unless I tap it multiple times or just click the mouse button instead of tapping the mousepad. Wifi connects reliably but I haven't tested Bluetooth yet. The keyboard feels sturdy and I like the key response. The keyboard also has a full number pad. Performance is about what you'd expect from a core i3 budget laptop. While obviously not as snappy or quick as an i7 in morre intense applications, I hardly notice a difference light tasks such as web browsing and office applications, which are the only things most home users do anyhow. As far as gaming, the casual game crowd, those who primarily play games Candy Crush, Bejeweled, Plants vs Zombies, and Maplestory will be happy. You definitely shouldn't buy this is you're looking for something to play a game like Call of Duty Ghosts, forget it. The same goes for video editing and rendering. Light photo editing is possible but if you plan to run a program like Photoshop, I'd definitely recommend bumping the RAM up to 8GB first. Boot time is about 20-30 seconds, which is a bit slow for Windows 8 but I wonder if it's partially due to the Dell software. Speaking of software, Dell thankfully didn't overload the PC with bloatware. In fact, the only unwanted programs I uninstalled were trials for Mcafee Internet Security and Office 365. There are a few Dell specific utility programs for backup, retore and support that I left installed. A word of warning, the Dell software started acting flaky after I upgrading to Windows 8.1. For example, I had to reinstall the Dell backup application before I was able to burn recovery DVDs. So, my advice is to burn your recovery DVD's and using Dell's support application to check for updated software before upgrading to Windows 8.1.The Dell 15R is a decent budget laptop. I am very satisfied with the value I received at the lightning deal price. At 30% off, I basically paid little more than the cost of a new netbook or Chromebook for this laptop. However, at the normal price of close to $500, I would strongly suggest exploring and considering other options. With a little searching and patience, you could likely find a better bargain. For instance, a Lenovo P400 Touch with 6GB RAM, (dual-core) i5 processor with turbo boost and 1600x900 resolution was recently selling for nearly the same price as this Dell. I have to be completely honest and admit that I likely would not have purchased this laptop if not for the lightning deal. However, for $150 less, I can live without an dual-core i5 CPU, a few extra pixels and 2gb of extra RAM. So my three star rating is for this PC selling at full price. For the price I paid, it's four stars easily, but I can't rate based on a sale price that lasted mere seconds. My star rating is based on other laptops at comparable prices, like the aforementioned Lenovo.","December 4, 2013",
laptops,"Dude, it's a Dell",Fight for the User,R15LK1VX04IX03,3,"It's functional. The case/shell is sturdy and has a bit of heft to it. It doesn't come with a lot of the bloatware that older Dell models came with. As a replacement for an older (6+ years) Dell, this computer is significantly faster, not only on startup, but also accessing web content. Seems like a perfect fit for people who want a basic, semi-intuitive touchscreen laptop that offers slightly more than a basic netbook.Keep in mind, however, that the screen is a fingerprint magnet (the drawback to touchscreens), but is very responsive to user input. I found myself getting headaches after spending a couple hours using this laptop. I finally realized that it was the screen brightness - way too bright and contrasty. Unfortunately, Windows 8 doesn't give you the range of customization that previous version of Windows did (e.g. simple things like adjusting brightness and contrast). I finally settled on a brightness setting that makes the screen tolerable and doesn't induce headaches after a couple hours of use.","May 31, 2014",
laptops,"The Dell Laptop is of superior quality, but >>>",Edward P Gibson,R2LGY27H9NGDKO,3,"the fact it came installed with Windows 8, which required an 'update' to 8.1 from Microsoft, has been difficult at best. Windows 8.1 is not user friendly, and version 8 has no START button though a pseudo START button was added in version 8.1. I have no doubt that Windows 8.1 would be a great platform for a tablet but it is a cultural shift on a laptop or desktop when serious computing is required. As for the Dell case, it is well built and the outside of the case looks 'tough' but after a few uses it becomes a fingerprint haven.","February 15, 2014",

laptops,Decent but spend a bit more for a better model.,Crazy4mykids,R1DQ7FQQCUPL09,3,"I got this laptop specifically for Windows 7 and the Microsoft office starter. I have another laptop with Windows 8 and am not very happy with it, or the fact that with Windows 8 you need to subscribe to Microsoft Office annually and can't purchase it.This laptop was a decent price, but I am sorry I didn't spend a bit more on a better model.Positives: I like the weight of the laptop and the battery seems to hold out for a long time. (I have not timed it, but I would say several hours or more.) I like the keyboard. The keys don't press down too easily, but it is not like typing on a typewriter, either.Negatives: The speakers are terrible. You can barely hear anything. They work fine with headphones, but if I want to listen without headphones, I need to strain to hear it. There is also no slot for a camera card. It's possible that was in the description. I just assumed that would be standards on laptops today. I don't know if it is the computer or Internet Explorer, but IE shuts down on me at least twice a day. Sometimes I log out of all IE tabs, and then click the IE icon, and it won't bring anything up. I try to shut down and restart the computer and it gets stuck in shutdown mode. I eventually need to just turn it off and back on again. Then it works fine. I don't think that it is a virus because it has been happening since day 1.I have been using the computer for exactly 5 weeks.All in all, the computer will work as a spare, but not what I had hoped for.","December 12, 2013",

The battery life is excellent, and I get the full 6 or so hours it says I should. I'll leave the cord home if I don't think I'll be using it longer than 3 or 4 out in the wild.The display is okay and the speakers are weak, so not a Netflix machine, but I bought it for school, and it runs Access, Excel, and all my browser/social media needs quite well. It's fairly fast.But the touchpad is a disgrace. I turned it off and use a bluetooth mouse instead.Also, the build seems a bit flimsy. You need two hands to open it, I worry about how long the lid hinges will last, and the keyboard has a bit of give (gloss red is a bit tricky to keep the fingerprints off).I typically use MacBooks, so I'm used to higher quality in the interface - keyboards, trackpad, visuals and audio.

laptops,Loaded with garbage programs and poor customer support,Byron Fitzgerald,RIKPLSFC77GKO,3,"I use the computer in the TV room and its primary use is to provide access to emails I can read while watching TV. When I first got it I found it was loaded with programs I did not want or need and when I removed them the computer seized up and I had to do a factory reboot to get it started again. It really balked when I removed the factory anti-virus program and added Security Essentials and really gagged when I loaded Microsoft Office. When I add new programs it takes an impossible time to process the additions and I am afraid that the machine has frozen up because it takes it so long to process new additions. To help solve the processing time problem I decided to upgrade the machine to 8GB RAM and ordered the chips to do the upgrade. Although Acer advertises the computer as 8 GB machine, there are no instructions in the operator's manual on how to open the machine to add the chips nor can I find the chips for sale on the Acer web site. After looking for several hours for instructions on how to open the machine to add the chips, I finally gave up and called customer support. Much to my displeasure, the off shore tech rep I spoke with told me they did not want me to open the machine and that if I did my warranty would be voided. They declined to give instructions on how to gain access to the RAM chip area. It appeared that there is an access plate on the bottom of the machine that needed to come off and this is held by a single screw. I was hesitant to remove the back plate without instructions because it was not obvious whether the plate snapped or slid into position and I did not want to damage it by putting pressure in the wrong place. I did find an excellent internet site that explained how to open the back plate (it slides to the front after removal of the one retaining screw) and I was able to add the chips to upgrade the machine to 8 GB. The RAM upgrade has not appreciably improved the performance of the computer and at random times it takes considerable time to boot up. The audio volume is quite low and virtually unusable in a room with any background activity. As an overall evaluation, it has been a real challenge to purge the machine of garbage software and add the programs I normally use and the customer support from Acer leaves much to be desired. Cannot recommend for purchase.","December 20, 2013",

Bad keyboard is obviously a cost-cutting measure, but keyboard is so important on a laptop computer!!

It regularly glitches out and refuses to work, and it's obviously a hardware problem since I've already tried reinstalling try drivers. You'd think Acer would do something about this, but as far as I've seen, they're still selling the laptop as is.I bought the model from sams for a hundred dollars more, it came with a terrabyte hard drive and a better service plan ( which of course does nothing about my track pad problem since it only seems to happen when I'm typing a college paper of something of the sort).Overall, as long as you don't mind buying a logitech mouse to go with it, it's a good computer. The webcam works well, it does good browsing the internet. Like any laptop the battery claims are exagerated, but it's still got a good two or three hours of heavy use in it.As far as the touch screen goes it's somewhat unresponsive when it comes to zooming in.

laptops,A Computer Tablet Hybrid,Will,R3OVXBZSGNBUDD,3,"Before I tell you about my experience with this Chromebook, first let me tell you about what devices I have and why I decided to get this instead of a tablet. Before I bought this, I had an iMac, an iPod touch, and a basic cell phone. I wanted something that I could browse the internet with and do a bit of word processing on that I could take anywhere but didn't want to spend much, so I decided to get this instead of a tablet since I already have a tablet-like device (my iPod touch) and wanted something that was more for media creation than consumption. While this is definitely not a replacement for a computer, if you already have a desktop and just want something that lets you take a full-size browser with you and will allow you to efficiently type via its keyboard (a major feature tablets are missing), then this is definitely a device you should consider getting.Like I said before, this is NOT a replacement for a Mac or Windows computer since there are essentially only five apps: Chrome (obviously), a notepad, a file browser, a calculator, and a webcam camera app. There are a couple more standalone apps you can download, but the majority of ""apps"" are just links to webpages, so they are not really worth downloading since you can just bookmark pages that you visit frequently. While the Chrome OS is very streamlined and well thought-out, know that there are many things you will not be able to do on it. That being said, Chrome OS runs very smoothly even when you have a lot of Chrome tabs open and I never experienced any slowdowns, even before I upgraded the RAM to 6 GB by adding a 4 GB RAM module to its empty RAM slot (which hopefully didn't void the warranty in the process since I had to remove the seal above the one screw that holds the entire bottom panel on). I really enjoy browsing the web on this and it is super easy to transfer files between this and a computer when you put them on an SD card in the card slot, but the battery life on this is pretty disappointing. Even at a full charge with the brightness turned down, you will ONLY get around three hours of battery life, which is very meager for a brand new device that should be capable of holding a decent charge (right now, for instance, I have 2 hours and 28 minutes of battery left even though it still has a 68% charge). The build quality of this machine is decent and it feels pretty solid, although it is certainly not as well-built as a MacBook Air that costs $800 more.Overall, if you want a small and portable web browser with a physical keyboard, this device would be a great option for you. I do feel slightly uncomfortable that Google has so much of my personal information, such as all my bookmarks and extensions (I do not sync my history, tabs, or passwords with my computer), but it's not like they wouldn't have most of this information anyway, and there are workarounds for giving them less of your personal data, such as just typing on one Google Doc and transferring your text to Word after you finish working on something on your Chromebook. While there are certainly things you cannot do on this, there are workarounds for most things you would want to do, such as uploading all your music to Google Play (free for up to 20,000 songs) as a way to access your iTunes library, among others you will figure out as you become more familiar with the Chrome OS ecosystem. If you're in the market for this or a tablet and already have a smartphone, I would recommend this, for while it doesn't have many apps, it gives you a more traditional and productive computing experience than a consumption-oriented and most likely more expensive tablet.Update 1: The computer now has a dead pixel near the top center of the screen which is not noticeable most of the time but is still incredibly annoying. I checked Acer's policy on dead pixels and just like Apple and I would assume the industry as a whole, a few dead pixels are, to them, acceptable and not grounds for repair, so I will just have to live with it for as long as I keep the computer.Update 2: The computer's fan now runs constantly after it initially warms up. The Chromebook Central group on Google recommended that I remove some of the RAM so I removed the original 2 GB module but it is still running constantly now (I even tried using it with just its original 2GB of RAM again and it still runs constantly), which makes it impractical to use in class or in other quiet environments where there is no background noise. At this point I regret not just getting a similar-sized netbook that would give me a lot more functionality without some of the trade-offs of this bare bones ""computer,"" so I am reducing my rating from four to three stars.","September 18, 2013",

mobile phone,Decent reception + sound. Short Talk-Time.

Just need to get a pre-paid SIM chip locally.- Can be charged from laptop using included USB cable.- It's BLACK.THE OK======- Passable voice quality. (Maybe it's just because it's GSM technology, and coverage is not fantastic in outside of cities.)- Slim profile, though a little heavier than my previous handset- Nice colors in screen. Great ringtone sounds. Though these are pretty standard nowadays.- Decent bluetooth range. Paired this with a Jabra BT800 headset and I can run into the coin laundry with my ear piece and still connect with the phone in the car outside.THE BAD=======- Short battery life. 7 hours talk-time as advertised is a imaginary. Phone starts to beep after 2-3 hrs of talking.- Organizer (calendar, alarm, notes, contacts) doesn't sync correctly with Outlook.- Oily screens!! The inside and outside screens and the metallic keypad get oily fingerprints after every use (is it just my skin?!) Looks yucky and kinda destroys all the aesthetics. Tried wiping now and then but notice minor scratches start to accumulate. (My clothes are not always cotton and I don't usually carry eye glass cloth.)- Low camera resolution. Other new phones have close to twice that resolution. Pics always kinda dark.- Camera doesn't take video.- No MP3 or radio.

mobile phone,Form over Function,Deanna Breglia,R2TZJ78XDZ7IFH,3,"Don't expect this phone to work any better than a Motorola V551.

Nothing has changed.Don't get me wrong, this matte black phone is slim and sexy and lightweight fun and easy to slip into a pocket. But those are it's biggest draws.Some other cons include:-The large square screen and key pad get dirty easily from holding the phone up to your face. I don't wear make-up, but if I did, I can imagine that I'd always be taking a toothpick to all of those little crevices between the keys on the flat keypad all the time. As it is now, I'm constantly wiping the screen and keys.-The battery life is not long and if you're going anywhere overnight, remember to bring your charger.-The operating system is the same as other newer model Motorola phones, so don't expect a big upgrade there either.If Cingular is your provider, the sim card from your current phone will work in this unlocked version nicely. However, make sure you've saved all of your numbers and info on the card and not on the old phone before you take the sim card out of the old phone, because it doesn't slip into this phone very easily.

mobile phone,Watch out - this is a European edition phone,J. Hubbell,RUH86SC93SWJI,3,"Phone works fine in general.

mobile phone,Good phone for the money,S. Volz,R2SI9GHX27YY91,3,"This is my 4th razr in about 5 years. They last about 1 year. But they only cost about 80 bucks, or less if you can renew your cell phone contract and purchase through your service provider. I get this phone because it is physically durable and fits in my back pocket. I leave my phone in my back pocket and sit on it all the time. Maybe that's why they break - they have to withstand daily squashings by a 150 pound person. I use my phone strictly for making and receiving calls. I do not use it for the internet or media. There is no other phone on the market that fits in my back pocket comfortably. My other Razr's broke for the following reasons -1. after 1.5 years the inside screen quit working, i didn't attempt repair, just got a new phone because I was eligible for an upgrade through my provider.2. I dropped the phone on concrete and broke the external screen - apparently it's made of glass, but it still worked. after about 1.5 years, the battery wouldn't hold a charge for longer than a day, so I got a new razr.3. after about 1 year the battery stopped holding a charge for longer than a day.Then I switched to a blackberry pearl, which sucked.So I purchased this Razr, and it has lived up to my meager expectations. Should last about 1-1.5 years.","December 23, 2009",
mobile phone,Not too practical,Julie,R1V8HRMXHVTQ2P,3,"I fell for the stylish look of this phone, but regret getting it. First of all, it's not as small or thin as it looks in ads. It's actually pretty wide for a phone, and not that much thinner than your average (contemporary) phone. It has very low battery power. I'm not a big talker and even I find myself needing to charge this thing once a day. I find this unfortunate because I don't feel like I can rely on it if I have an emergency--the battery'll probably die just when I need it most.The menu is not at all user-friendly and many of the options are counter-intuitive (for example, the ""select"" button for one screen is the ""quit"" button on the next screen!). In short, it's very poorly designed and apparently Motorola but very little time into this model before mass marketing it.Finally, there are no games and no good rings on here. You have to download everything you want by way of any games or cool rings with both an internet charge and a per-game or per-ring charge.I think this is a good phone for someone who likes a lot of media bells and whistles and is willing to pay for them. But it's not a good phone for someone practical like me.","February 14, 2007",

I am continuously wiping mine and washing my hands (hey, aesthetics are an issue for some people)-5mb of storage space only-Camera quality is 0.3 Megapixels!

I scoured all the documentation and couldn't find that said anything for sure. My fingers were crossed that this ""international version"" would come with the two prong deal used widely across Europe.Of course, it's a universal voltage & Hz thing that only needs the physical adapter. Oddly, the packaging included an adapter for US style plugs. So they're trying. But to use in Europe will need another adapter.","June 11, 2010",
mobile phone,"An OK cell phone, body feels more plastic-y than my old one",Scott Fisher,RCLWCISTX8YCT,3,"I've already owned a Razr V3 for 21 months and this is pretty much exactly the same as the one I got from my mobile provider except for a few things. 1) the software on it is slightly different and has some AT&T; specific things installed and an AT&T; logo on the back, 2) the color is different (old one gray, this one black), 3) my old one felt like metal whereas this one feels like plastic. Maybe my old one just wore down the coating and this one isn't worn down yet and so the coating feels different, but it feels cheaper to me than my old one. I guess time will tell.I had to buy a new phone when my old one's display went out and I didn't want to get locked into a 2 year contract, so got this one. Unlocked is nice. I thought about getting something fancier, but this phone works pretty well as a basic cell phone and I don't really want to be paying $40 extra a month for wireless internet right now.All the good things about this phone involve its small size and the fact that it's a flip phone. It fits in the pocket nicely. The flip phone means your pocket doesn't call people since the buttons are closed up inside of it when it's flipped closed. My last one lasted 21 months being rubbed against other stuff in my pocket and the coating got chipped and beat up but the phone kept working. In fact it's still working, but the display went out one day when I was charging it and never came back, so I needed a new phone so I'm not dialing blind and unable to read text messages.The bad points are that the software isn't particularly great and it's hard to find things and make it do what you want. The address book is really limited and you have to enter multiple entries for the same person if you want to put multiple numbers in for them. I can't really imagine browsing the internet or watching videos on this thing, though I guess maybe someone does it. The camera is ok, but not particularly spectacular.It's really all about the compact size, flip-phone design, solid feel and functionality as a phone or phone and text-message only device.","February 4, 2009",

mobile phone,Mediocre,Jenrae,R14DZXVL1UF7K8,3,"I had a Motorola V190 and I wanted the RAZR cause it looked much more cool and my husband had one and liked his. So, I bought a magenta RAZR. I really liked the way it looked, it was easy to use and the talk/standby time was good. However, about a month after I got the phone it started powering down on it's own or the screen would go white (if during conversation it would disconnect). I bought a new battery thinking that was the problem...it wasn't. My husband then was going to upgrade the firmware on it only to discover that the phone already had the most recent firmware. I did use the phone for about a year as it only powered down about twice a month but after about a year it started powering down daily. It wasn't convenient to have it power down during an important conversation. So, I took the SIM card out and put it back in the V190. The V190 may not ""look"" cool but at least it's reliable. I now have a KRZR K1, but I will hold on to my V190 just in case. My husband never had a problem with his RAZR but I do know a couple of other people that had the same problem with theirs.

mobile phone,Decent reception + sound. Short Talk-Time. Lousy Camera.,redhill,R145NCDU9MC0LY,3,"I've been using a black RAZR for 3 months and here are my thoughts:THE GOOD========- FREE!! with a T-Mobile 1-year family plan- Better reception than my previous, 3 yr-old Nokia handset (6610)- Can use the same phone when travelling in Europe, Asia. Just need to get a pre-paid SIM chip locally.- Can be charged from laptop using included USB cable.- It's BLACK.THE OK======- Passable voice quality. (Maybe it's just because it's GSM technology, and coverage is not fantastic in outside of cities.)- Slim profile, though a little heavier than my previous handset- Nice colors in screen. Great ringtone sounds. Though these are pretty standard nowadays.- Decent bluetooth range. Paired this with a Jabra BT800 headset and I can run into the coin laundry with my ear piece and still connect with the phone in the car outside.THE BAD=======- Short battery life. 7 hours talk-time as advertised is a imaginary. Phone starts to beep after 2-3 hrs of talking.- Organizer (calendar, alarm, notes, contacts) doesn't sync correctly with Outlook.- Oily screens!! The inside and outside screens and the metallic keypad get oily fingerprints after every use (is it just my skin?!) Looks yucky and kinda destroys all the aesthetics. Tried wiping now and then but notice minor scratches start to accumulate. (My clothes are not always cotton and I don't usually carry eye glass cloth.)- Low camera resolution. Other new phones have close to twice that resolution. Pics always kinda dark.- Camera doesn't take video.- No MP3 or radio.

mobile phone,Pretty and Well Constructed - Poor Email Integration,Robby,R3GRV9HWA63Q8A,3,"This is the prettiest phone I have ever owned. Build quality is excellent and I liked the keypad. The phone is quick and responsive and call quality was good. The browser is not as good as on the iPhone, but much better than Windows Mobile. The OS does take some getting used to and does not look as pretty as competing ones. However, it offers tons of customization that iPhone owners can only dream of.I wanted to keep this phone, but chose to return it because of email integration. For POP email, it either checks email automatically and downloads the message or it checks it, downloads the header and informs you that you have a new message. This was a deal breaker for me. What's the point of downloading the message if it doesn't alert the user that there are new messages? Going the other route (by downloading headers only) would be ok, if it didn't take ages to manually download messages. Also, hotmail and yahoo mail required special apps to download, which did not automatically check for new messages. The final email related frustration is that by default, it does not download html messages. You can click the attachment and it brings up the message in the browser, but it's an extra step.One final distraction was the phone's constant alerts asking if it was ok to connect to the network and asking which one to connect to. For North American users that have an ""unlimited"" data plan, this option is annoying.","December 10, 2008",
mobile phone,"Nice phone, but OS and antenna location cripple it",Eric R.,R3FKQQDMJ3JX1T,3,"I won't restate why so many people adore this phone -- it's very well-documented.I got rid of this phone and replaced with a BlackBerry 8900 and the difference is night and day. The 8900 for my money is far superior.Do you like Facebook? Pandora? True push email that works without fuss? Threaded, conversational text messaging? A great 3.2 MP camera with auto-focus that takes good pictures? Well, if so, the Nokia e71 doesn't do any of those things.Facebook/Pandora, there's no app for Symbian. Nokia's ""Mail for Exchange"" works well if crudely. But want Gmail, Yahoo, or any other web-based or IMAP/POP mail to show up on the Nokia as it arrives? No can do. Sure, there are 3rd party apps like Seven or Nokia's Email, but I found the battery to drain in short order when those things were running. I also found those add-ons to make the OS unstable. Had to reboot the phone 1-2X/week.I found the camera to take grainy, purple-hued pictures.Oh yeah, a 2.5 mm headphone jack just adds insult to injury. So if you want to use your own headphones, you'll need an adapter to add bulk and noise.Further, I found that it lost 3G signal constantly in my home. The antenna is located in the base of the handset, so if you hold the phone by the base, you will lose a few bars of reception.In other words, I didn't find the phone to even be that reliable for calls. As you're on the phone, the crude OS fills your ears with beeps as you ""lose packet connection"" or the phone puts ""packet connection on hold"" or lose your radio signal all together. I was often very frustrated by this expensive piece of hardware.Now it wasn't all bad. It's unlocked, so you don't need to sign a contract. It is built very solidly, with lots of steel and chrome. It's very slim, so easily fits in your pocket.But initial pleasure with the phone turned to displeasure because of all of the aforementioned points.Couldn't want to get rid of it.

The screen is not so big likewise and the keyboard is hard to operateon due to it being small and crammed up making it difficult to implement operations fast. GPS is good but it takes around 15 minutes at least for it to start reading the satellite.

mobile phone,"Decent, but frustrating",Brad,R3V6SIWJTICJ02,3,"I have always loved nokia, and I continue to do so but I am half way between very impressed and displeased with this product (E71). It runs much faster than the N95 (with fewer options in regards to camera quality, integrated photo-editing ability, music player/video options, and no accelerometer). I am finding though that tasks I used to be able to do on the N95 (like have browser open, switch applications to messaging, then back to home screen) throttle this device. I've had numerous times it freezes on me, or ""not enough memory"" when you try to read a text message from the inbox. Nothing else is running and I can open other applications fine, but as soon as I hit the inbox I get this error.I'm not sure what to make of it; I got the E71 until I could get my hands on the N900 with AT&T;, but I'm thinking of going with the E72 just because I see a lot of improvements made to it (especially the 5.0MP camera, which I do miss). I do like the new OS version though, and the ability to switch between modes of work/home use, just I could go without the full memory errors and need to reboot the phone.","February 6, 2010",

It has wi-fi, easily shifts between email accounts,can send group texts; it does a lot of things real well. The challenge I had was the size. The phone fits nicely in your pocket, but I had to get a rubber case to feel comfortable typing on it without worrying about dropping the phone ( I didn't). The intuitive text is very nice, and the keys feel good and secure, just a little bit bigger would have been great.

mobile phone,It's okay.,W.Tran,R3MQL6LMLC2TV8,3,"I'm a little tech geek and I'm always out there looking for the underdogs. I heard about this E71, and after reading countless reviews, I purchased it. I used it for several months before I gave it away.The reason why I chose this phone was because I was looking for a blackberry alternative, something much more inexpensive, and this was my choice.The messaging, separate inboxes and outboxes get quite annoying because I find myself being unable to recall the last thing said/sent in a message. I have to scroll to and from each folder trying to figure it out, and going back again to understand the context from which I was speaking. The camera and video recording is quite good. However, the phone itself can be quite laggy, even with an 8 gig memory card inside. Music playing/searching can be quite awkward because you don't have an option to search for it, you have to scroll through and that can be time consuming. There are little modifications you can make to the homescreen or menu options, which can be a tad boring. The 'apps' or the market system they have for the phone is quite subpar. The quality of the images of the apps are not the best, but there are apps (to my surprise). The connection to wifi and such can be such a troublesome task, it took me a while to figure out and configure. The featured free GPS didn't work for me, I don't know why. I could map myself, but that was it. The design of the phone is exceptional, I thought it was a beautiful piece. And given my small hands, I felt that it fit comfortably and was easy to use. The keyboard can get some getting used to. The programs that came with the phone can be found in almost any standard phone. I feel that this phone wasn't 'smart' enough for me. I feel that if you're looking for a decent phone that looks great, this is it. But if you're looking for a phone packed with much more, you're better off getting an android or something (which I did).","September 4, 2011",

mobile phone,"great with flaws, mainly 3G reception",R. Russell,RX1POG2GYL76J,3,"i want to give this phone 5 star, but i just can't. i've had this for about 6 months on metro detroit at&t; 3g network. it's got a lot of cool features that i use a lot: GPS and Wi-Fi. Which is great for searching the net on the go and knowing where you're at. I like having the MicroSD slot. Features I haven't used as much lately were the music player and internet radio. It's compact, does what I need it to do, convenient, and on and on... but there are some flaws I've come across unfortunately:- music player is choppy when playing an hour long dj mix. the song plays fine on the computer, mp3 cd, ipod, but not this phone. i downloaded a different music player, so we'll see if that works- internet radio seems to just shut off the phone. i haven't used this in a while, so maybe updates to the program have fixed itSignal Strength Problems- this phone drops 3G calls constantly. i've tried other phones on the 3G network in my house, near my house, and in the general metro detroit area without any problems.- i sent this phone in for warranty because the vibrate mechanism stopped working and the reception problems were getting bad. I got the phone back in like 4 days which was awesome, but second call i made, dropped call. All while showing FULL 3G signal strength. I did some research online and seems like a lot of people are having 3G signal problems with this model phone. I think it's because of the metal frame and the compact size. This is a hassle because if I want a garaunteed non-dropped call, i need to change it to GSM only. and to use internet , i need to change it to 3G, then go back and change it to GSM.OverallIt's unfortunate that some $50 phones have better reception than this, but I still like this phone a lot. It has a lot of great features, sleek design, lots of potential, and a great company backing it. I would buy another Nokia, but I don't know about this model. I hope other people that buy this have better call connections than i do!","June 30, 2009",

I was able to use this phone for work and personal e-mail without major problems for about a year. Unfortunately, about thirteen months after I got the E71, it started rebooting randomly. Finally last month, on a business trip to San Diego, it began to reboot constantly, rendering it virtually unusable. I tried reseting the device without any change. I looked up some posts on the internets and some thought it was related to the AT&T; network in certain areas. Perhaps it was a conflict with my Jawbone bluetooth or other software I had installed.

mobile phone,Not worth the hassle,Baron Von Shavenwell,RMPSSGA11OOOV,3,"I did lots (and lots and lots) of research on the e71, which was my choice to replace a Blackberry Pearl I'd had for a couple years. I needed to buy unlocked because 1.) my BB died one day, and 2.) I'm stuck on T-mobile. Because iPhones aren't ""officially"" unlocked, I settled on this e71, which seems to be Nokia's iPhone alternative.After the giddiness of having a new phone wore off, I became more and more disappointed in this phone. It is certainly no iPhone (which my wife has), and isn't much better than my old Blackberry. Call quality is the best feature. That's about it.Because Nokia has not updated the firmware for North American versions (e71-2 models, i.e. this one I bought from Amazon), there are a number of very annoying bugs in the operating system. Strike 1: The OS routinely crashes and reads ""Memory Full"" when it definitely is not full, and the only way to stop the warning screens from appearing is to reboot. Strike 2: The enclosed app for corporate email, called ""Mail for Exchange"" was so bad and difficult to configure that my IT guy and I finally gave up and bought a $50 RoadSync application that works OK. (As a comparison, it took my wife approximately 3 minutes to configure her iPhone for corporate MS Exchange email.) Strike 3: The phone sometimes makes an awful popping sound when playing keypad tones or application chimes, It is like the clicking and popping sound you get when speakers overload or get too much signal. Others have experienced this on the Nokia support boards, as well, and it may be a hardware issue.OS bugs aside, there are also significant hardware disadvantages of this piece compared with the iPhone. The screen isn't wide enough to see a full line of sender, date, and email subject on the screen. You have to guess sometimes at what the message might be. This makes the chances of opening SPAM from the coporate server a lot greater, in my experience. The camera is merely adequate, and mine casts a purple hue to all pictures -- not uncommon, according to other users. I can manually set it to Sepia mode and it looks better, but that's a pain. My wife's iPhone takes great photos as is.By far the most annoying ""feature"" of this phone is in setting up ring tones and alert tones. In the Blackberry, you can indicate how many times you want a tone to ring. It seems that, in this Nokia, it's either ON or OFF. Sometimes I want an alert to ring once, and that's it. Maybe a single chime to let me know about an email or something. The sounds on the e71 just keep going and going until you manually silence them.I bought this phone mainly because I thought Nokia had a reputation for quality and solid phones. It also had a full size, real qwerty keyboard, which I prefer to the screen-based keyboard of the iPhone. The construction of the phone is solid. It has nice build quality. It's pretty. But this and the qwerty keyboard benefit doesn't make this phone worth all the trouble of the other numerous issues.My T-Mobile contract is up in February, and I'm headed to the Apple Store to get an iPhone unless Nokia updates the e71 firmware for N. America. I'll end up selling this one on eBay for a loss, and I'll be happy as a clam to get rid of it. Overall, my experience with the phone as my main corporate and personal communicator has been at the most satisfactory. My apologies to all the Nokia fanatics out there, but the iPhone beats this brick by a mile.","December 27, 2008",

mobile phone,Didn't live up to my expectations of a BlackBerry,Dan,R102KL5JHL5COP,3,"I knew this was going to happen. Research In Motion (the makers of the BlackBerry series of smart phones) finally made a product that didn't live up to my expectations.I'll tell you more in detail below, but first a bit of history: At my 9-to-5 job it is one of my roles to manage a BlackBerry server and 50-odd BlackBerry phones, so I've used every model of BlackBerry available in the US for the most part in some capacity or another.Currently, I have a Verizon BlackBerry Curve at the office. My current home cell phone is an iPhone 3G. I asked our corporate Verizon representative to send me a demo of the Storm, because I've had a lot of BlackBerry users at work asking me when we were getting them (due to the media saturation of the commercials and the general coolness factor of how the phone looks). So I felt it was my duty to get one in for review so I could make an educated decision about recommending this thing to upper management and other people who may be interested in it.A lot has been said about this phone in reviews by other technology journalists on the web (David Pogue of the New York Times for instance, and Walt Mossberg of the Wall Street Journal), some positive, some negative. I used the phone for a solid 4 days of testing and one software upgrade (to try to fix an issue, more later on that) before deciding to write this.I'll go over some key items about the phone in a few sections, the stuff that's important to me as a consumer. Things that have been in BlackBerry OS forever (such as push email, calendar sync, etc) are really not that noteworthy to me, and I won't talk much about those. I can, and will compare this phone to the iPhone 3G though, simply because RIM was definitely aiming right at Apple when designing this, I have no doubts about that.Phone DesignThe BlackBerry Storm is a slick looking phone -- which elicits the expected reaction from nearly everyone you show it to. It is very heavy feeling, about the same weight as the iPhone 3G. I would say it feels solid, but then you press down on the touchscreen itself (since it is one large button), and it wobbles and leaks light in from behind the screen. It is not the most comfortable phone to hold, but then again I don't think the iPhone wins in that category, either. Both of them could benefit from the rubberized grip of the BlackBerry Curve (or other phones that actually seem like they're designed to be held).Underneath the black aluminum battery cover (yes, unlike the iPhone the battery can be removed - score 1 for RIM), there is a removable 8GB MicroSDHC card, which is a great thing for them to provide. The last generation of BlackBerry phones (The Curve and Pearl) include a MicroSD card slot, but they didn't give you a card with the phones. 8GB is more than enough for a decent amount of media and pictures. It also included a Verizon SIM card (which I think is a placeholder, since Verizon doesn't sell GSM phone service). I've been told that this can be unlocked just as easily as other BlackBerry phones so you can roam the world with it easily (this is another thing the iPhone 3G requires hacking to do.)RIM abandoned the standard Mini USB port they've used for several years for a new ""Micro"" USB port for charging and connecting the phone to the computer. This means all your old BlackBerry chargers and any wired peripherals won't work with the new phone. This is kind of a letdown for me as a BlackBerry administrator, simply because we have dozens of perfectly good spare BlackBerry car and home chargers that are now useless if we move to the Storm.The ScreenThe screen is one of the better things this phone has to offer. It has a 3.25', 480Ã—360 pixel screen, with very easy to read text and a very bright backlight, with a nice glossy sheen to it. I really have no gripes whatsoever with the actual screen in this phone by itself, if I don't take into account the way or manner information is displayed on it or it's ""click"" function. It is better than the iPhone's screen in both clarity, size, and general readability.The AccelerometerThis is the first BlackBerry with an accelerometer in the device. Again, another thing I believe RIM decided to copy from the iPhone (even though the iPhone is not the first device to use something like this, it's the first one to do it right in my opinion.) I found the sensor had major lag issues (even after a software update to the 4.7.0.75 leaked firmware!) with moving from portrait to landscape. Sometimes it took up to 4 seconds for the phone to change back from landscape to portrait with nothing else going on. This is simply unacceptable. It would inadvertently switch screen orientation at random times when it wasn't necessary to do so, and it confused all the users I gave the phone to. The final straw with the accelerometer is for some reason RIM believes that if you have your phone locked, it should still change orientation from portrait to landscape. I honestly can't figure out why I'd want my phone sitting there in my pocket switching orientation when it's locked and not being used. I hope they fix this in a software update.The KeyboardThe screen being covered in its literal sense, I'll discuss the biggest part of what makes the Storm the Storm: The keyboard and its role in the UI. RIM decided in the BlackBerry Storm's development to eschew the traditional BlackBerry keyboard for two different ""touch"" keyboards. These both are familiar to older users of BlackBerry phones: The ""SureType"" style in the 7100 series and Pearl (2 letters per key), active while in Portrait orientation, or the QWERTY style (full keyboard), like in the Curve, 8700, and 8800 series, which is active in landscape orientation.However, the old keyboard layouts work completely differently in the Storm -- because they are now part of the touch screen and are activated by ""clicking"" in the entire screen while your finger is over the corresponding button. The screen acts as one giant button that you press in with every letter press, icon click, or menu selection.I've found typing for any period of time becomes tiresome after only a minute or so, and it seems like way too much work even to just send off a small text message. The auto-correction software (SureType) seems like it isn't as effective as it was in the BlackBerry Curve, and sometimes the phone simply types letters that I didn't press, even though it looks like I'm pressing the right one due to the blue ""halo"" around my finger as I hover over the letters.The keyboard isn't completely missing. There are still 4 physical buttons on the front of the phone, which include the typical SEND and END keys, the ""Menu"" key, and the ""Back"" key, both of those last two are holdovers from previous BlackBerry incarnations. I'm kind of surprised they couldn't find some way to integrate these into the touch screen.If this review was trying to convince me to buy this phone, this keyboard would be the deal breaker. I can't stand it. People who might peck one or two characters every 5 seconds might not care about how bad this is, but for me, it was infuriating to use it. I can type on my BlackBerry Curve at approximately 30 words a minute. The iPhone 3G? maybe 20-25. This was much, much less than that. I'm extremely disappointed; one of the huge advantages of BlackBerry was their highly efficient keyboard and the ""Pearl"" (or scroll wheel in the older generations), and that speed and fluidity is completely obliterated with a keyboard UI that just doesn't work. I had several non-techie users at my office try to type on it who were BlackBerry users, and they either typed incredibly slow or were just confused by the new keyboard.The Touch Screen, And It's Role In The User InterfaceIn general, the touch screen functions are a good effort for a phone if you ignore one thing: the existence of iPhone. Apple clearly invested much, much more time into usability and interface design here than RIM did. A few things about the iPhone that you don't notice you miss until you use the Storm are the ability to quickly ""flick"" through lists of items, multi-touch capabilities like pinch gesturing, double-tapping to zoom smoothly into/out of web pages, and smooth scrolling through websites. All of these things are not something the Storm does well (or at all in some cases), and I'm sure I'm missing a lot more here. Maybe its related to patent issues, but the touch screen in the Storm just seems dumber than the iPhone touch screen. That's about all I can say about it.Research In Motion has not paid enough attention to the menu UI in regards to making it easy for people to ""click"" on menu items, either. They are too small for even my (not that large) fingers to consistently press in properly. Making calls from the old UI was simple: Start dialing from the home screen. Now you have to press the SEND button to get to the call area, or click on the call log, which wasn't immediately apparent to any veteran BlackBerry user I showed it to.The AppsAs of right now, there's really little that is new or interesting about the applications bundled with the Storm. VZ Navigator is included, which is a turn-by-turn GPS application that has a lot of good Points of Interest and other neat features. Unfortunately Verizon charges $10/mo for this feature, which is really not worth paying a monthly fee for. There's not a good turn-by-turn GPS on the iPhone right now, but if it cost $10/mo extra, I wouldn't buy it anyway.Refinements to BlackBerry OS 4.7 to make it look very pretty are great, but those were done in OS 4.6 already for the BlackBerry Bold (a far superior phone for people who might actually want to type out an email!). BlackBerry even created some sort of half-baked version of Apple's App Store, but it simply forwards you to web pages to download applications. Not even close, RIM.The development happening for iPhone right now is astounding. I'd be surprised if the Storm gets this level of interest, considering there's already a huge glut of years worth of BlackBerry applications that still work on the Storm. There are a lot of great BlackBerry apps (A shining example is BeeJiveIM, which is also on iPhone), so it's not all bad but it really doesn't compare to some of the great stuff on the iPhone right now.On a positive note, applications on the Storm (or any other BlackBerry) can run in the background, which is one thing about the iPhone that is a frustrating design choice apple made that they play off as a feature to save battery life.The Web BrowserOne of the biggest changes in the 4.7 BlackBerry OS for the Storm is the web browser. The web browser definitely benefits from the much higher screen resolution on this phone, and actually renders real pages in a very readable way. Verizon's network is extremely fast (but not WiFi fast). The browser simply isn't up to the level of Mobile Safari on the iPhone/iPod Touch, though. The gestures that are in the iPhone for web browsing are light-years ahead in terms of ease of use than in the BlackBerry browser. This version is a marked improvement over the BlackBerry OS 4.5 browser, though.The NetworkAs the commercials state, Verizon's data network is the fastest out there. Their voice coverage is arguably the best in the nation. The phone does not have Wi-Fi, though, which comes in handy when you're somewhere that doesn't have Verizon's extremely fast Rev. A EVDO. This is the first BlackBerry on Verizon that supports tethering for internet on Rev. A EVDO, the prior ones only supported Rev. 0 (the slower EVDO speed).Generally speaking, sites and downloads came through very quickly in my tests in my metro area. The phone supports both CDMA (Verizon) network, and GSM networks with a SIM (worldwide with an unlock which is something very easy to do on the BlackBerry and not something you can do on the iPhone without hacks.) This is one of the major advantages of having this phone on Verizon, their network is great. You pay for it, though.CameraIt's not all bad news. The camera is 3.2 megapixels, with an auto-focus feature. At this point this is the best camera I have ever used in a cell phone. As a disclaimer I must mention I haven't used the Nokia N95, which has a 5 megapixel camera in it, or the new N97. The auto-focus feature is main reason I like this camera. Being able to focus on close items (e.g. a piece of paper) and still have the text on the page be sharp is a huge bonus; this is something you simply can't do with the iPhone 3G's camera. The camera's lag time for the shutter and taking photos is brutally slow, especially in low light. The iPhone 3G's camera has similar issues, though.Battery LifeThe battery life on the Storm seemed to be pretty decent; I don't have any scientific estimates on how long it lasts under light or heavy use. One of my gripes with the iPhone 3G is you can easily drain the battery to nearly nothing within 3 hours if you use it heavily. I didn't have anything worth using heavily on my Storm to really drain it, so I'm not a totally fair judge of this, but it seemed that the Storm's battery life is quite decent, and probably better than the iPhone 3G for general use.Additionally, having a removable battery is a very nice feature... albeit one I don't really care much about, since I generally have some type of charger near me, whether it's in a car, my desk at work, or an outlet at home.General Impressions / In ClosingSo, you're wondering after reading this, do I recommend the BlackBerry Storm to anyone?My short answer: No.My longer answer: The phone isn't refined enough. It lags doing simple things like orienting the screen and scrolling through the icons (even after their first firmware update), and needs more attention paid to the UI.For consumers on Verizon who won't leave (either due to loyalty or the other carriers not having good signal in your area), or corporate customers on Verizon: I'd say to either get a BlackBerry Pearl or Curve, or better yet, wait for Verizon to get the BlackBerry Bold (probably sometime in 2009). You don't want this touch screen. Skip it. I haven't personally reviewed the Bold yet, but it seems like it's inherited all the best UI features from the Storm and a great input interface to use them with.For consumers who want a cool phone right now and don't care about what carrier it's on: Get the iPhone 3G. Right now, overall, it is truly the best smart phone for the largest swath of consumers out there. Its flaws are overcome by an amazing development scene and a very well done user interface.","December 8, 2008",
mobile phone,"A great toy, questionable phone.",C. Fallon,RNYMUKY8SZLBI,3,"Executive summary:Not ready for business phone use. Too slow, and freezes too often. Excellent email capabilities, but all Blackberry's (BB's) have that. Fun phone with a lot of easy to download third party applications, including free GPS. Phone will either crash (Which requires a battery pull and about a 5 minute reboot sequence) or freeze for 1 min+, once or more a day. As a result of this, it is not reliable enough for business use. For personal use, these things are not that big of a deal IMHO.Full review:So you've read a million different reviews and they all seem to be either it is the greatest phone in the world, or it is the biggest piece of crap that Blackberry has ever made. So who is right? Well, like all things, it would depend on what the person values in a PDA. I will try to reserve from personal judgement as much as possible and just list the facts.A bit of background on me, I am a techie, and have used smartphones for both business and personal use for about 4 years now.The Cons of the Storm:1) Slow rebooting time, it is not an exageration to say it is over 5 minutes. This would not be as big of an issue if the Blackberry Storm did not crash so frequently. As I've owned it for about a month and I think I can count on one hand the days that it hasn't crashed so far, this can get very annoying and is completely unacceptable for business use.2)It will frequenty freeze for no reason ESPECIALLY when there is an incomming call, making it impossible to answer.3) The portrait ""Answer"" button and the Landscape ""Ignore"" button seemingly overlap, so if you are picking up the phone and turning it, you may accidentally hit ignore to a call you meant to accept, or worse...vice versa. Being that when you pick up the phone, you will almost definitely turn it...this is unforgivable as a business use device.4) If you are using the keypad and a call comes in, you may very well fall victim to what happens in # 3, as depending upon what you are clicking when the call comes in, you will either be answering or ignoring the call before you even know it happened.5) Many people complain that it sounds like you are talking through a wall unless you put your mouth directly over the microphone. Oddly enough, this issue is 100% resolved when you put the person on speakerphone.6) It is slow. It can take 1-2 seconds to go from screen to screen. This may not seem like a lot of time, but it can get frustrating to some people. I have seen some video comparisons with the Storm Vs. The Pearl or Curve, and the lag on the Storm is VERY noticable when looked at side by side.7) The media player is difficult to navigate and takes an excessive amount of time to go from song to song (4-6 seconds). Also, quite frequently, it does not carry the volume you listened to the previous song onto the next one.8) A lot of backlight comes out from all four sides of the screen...this is worrysome as that means that a lot of dust gets in, and in the long run it could mean that your Blackberry may break sooner than it should.9) This is more an Apple issue than a Blackberry, but just to confirm, (although Apple ""claims"" they are doing away with this), you CAN NOT use any song that was purchased on Itunes on your Blackberry. There is a Blackberry program that uses tricky verbiage to make you believe otherwise, IE ""Copy your entire Itunes playlist to your Blackberry."" For clarity purposes they should add ""Unless the songs were purchased through Itunes directly, as the Data Protection Management will block the transfer."" Yes, there are ways around this but it would take someone with extra time on their hands and a bit of tech savy...or $30-$50 to purchase a program that will do it. As I said, this is more an Apple issue than Blackberry, but I know some people want to know this, and it is rarely posted.10) No Wi-Fi, although, apparently the Canadian version will be getting it and making it available on both AT&T; and Verizon.Those are the Cons I can think of (I will update this posting as more come up, or the priors are fixed)The Pros:1) Interchangable battery, this shouldn't be a ""pro"" but since one of the biggest cons of the Iphone is that you can't, it is definitely a plus for the storm.2) Comes with an 8 GB Micro SD card that is upgradable to 16 gigs. Also something that you can't do on the Iphone, you get what you pay for.3) Very easy to set up email, including Outlook Web that works just as well as regular enterprise activation, but without the additional charge from Verizon. The difference being no Outlook calendar or automatically synced contacts.4) A lot of fun third party applications, games.5) You can instantly turn any song on your phone into a ringtone for free, or you can just copy your mp3's into the ""ringtone"" folder from your computer to your Blackberry. This is a nice, unmentioned feature. Any Mp3 you have (provided it's not from Itunes) you can just plop in your Blackberry and it's a ringtone.6) GREAT speakphone, both in people hearing you, not hearing background noise and you hearing people on it. Easily the best speakerphone on any cellphone/smartphone I've ever used.7) The call screen has easy, big buttons to put it on speakerphone, mute, and add an additional caller. Ease of use makes this a big plus in my opinion, and not having to flop around to a side button that you aren't sure if it does what you think it does is nice.8) The browser works very well, and I haven't had an issue with any web page clicking through. If a page isn't work correctly with the click of the phone, there is an option to click on a button that gives you a mouse cursor, and just putting the mouse cursor over any clickable link always works.9) The screen is larger than the Iphone and looks absolutely brilliant, vibrant, bright, etc...pretty much imagine a high end LCD computer monitor shrunk.10) Average battery life. If it's used heavily, it'll last your work day...if used lightly (IE, no video and no internet) it'll last a full day. The ability to swap in a backup battery though makes this a pro, as really with two batteries, you have an unlimited amount of time as the batter recharges extremely quick (From near empty to full in 2 hours or so).Bottom line:If you are using it for personal use, you'll love it. If you are using it for business use, you are going to hate it.","January 9, 2009",
mobile phone,Not the perfect storm,GDV,R2DTADYLSXF0PN,3,"After problem after problem with At&t;'s service, I finally cancelled my contract and finally made the move to Verizon. While I am extremly happy with Verizon's service, I'm sorry to say that I will be returning my Storm for the Curve because it just isn't working out for me. Too many kinks and I just dont have time for the sluggishness and the freezing and the lengthy rebooting sessions, not to mention typing on that nightmare of a keyboard. Here's my more specific review..SMS and MMS Messaging: Probably one of the main uses for me and with the storm its a nightmare! Texting on that keyboard takes forever. Not only that but everytime you press a letter it never seems to be the one you were going for and you have to keep erasing and starting over. Sometimes I just give up and throw it down and say I'll just call them! I can't tell you how frustrating this is.Calender: Good, no major problems with that.Browser: Excellent! Fast and easy to use.Media: Ok this is where some of the major snags are. While the picture, video and sound quality are top notch, don't plan on using them too much otherwise it will freeze up, get stuck between screens, or tell you after only 1 video your whole memory is full! And trust me once its frozen, the only way to unfreeze it is by taking the battery out and rebooting the phone takes forever! Really inconvienient. I was so mad..I was at a concert video taping the best part and guess what happened? You guessed it! It froze and lost my whole video. I was pissed to say the least.Instant Messaging: I use aim alot, glad it came with the phone, although if you stay signed into it all day it will drain your battery. Again anything where you have to use that keyboard is a nightmare so that would be my only complaint with the IM feature.Voice Dialing: Awesome! Can't say enough great things about this feature. All you do is press the side soft key and say call ""so and so"" and you can easily dial anyone from your contacts list without having to pre- record their name.Games: Love em! Especially Word Mole.Email: Awesome! But thats typical for Blackberrys. But once again that keyboard will definitly slow your typing speed and acuracy down alot so if you have a lot to say in a short amount of time use your desktop.Call sound/Quality: Speakerphone is choppy although its nice and loud. Answering the phone can be hard sometimes. On several occasions I've pressed the answer button both on the touch screen and the regular key and both were unresponsive and the phone just kept ringing like I had never answered it and eventually sent the person to voicemail. Another extremly frustrating and inconvienient thing to have to deal with.Battery: Not so hot. Ok if you aren't signed into any web based applications, but still plan on charging a full charge before you leave in everyday.Picture Quality: Excellent! Just as the say it is.Overall:Pros: Picture Quality, Browser, Email, Games, Instant MessagingCons: Keyboard, Sluggish switching from screen to screen, freezes during Media applications, Lenghty Reboot, Answering CallsIn conclusion..I feel that Blackberry should have let this cook in the oven a little longer before releasing it. Don't take advantage of your customers and try to get it out in time for the holiday rush if you know it still has all these glitches. And I'm sorry but Blackberry had to know about these before they released it. I don't believe that they didnt. So for now I'm going to the curve, maybe not so fancy but I've had one before with At&t; and it was more reliable. Can't wait until Verizon gets the Bold, that's the Blackberry I really want!","December 14, 2008",
mobile phone,OK but not fantastic,Sadech Prahok,RYWIL03TWOUG,3,"I bought the Storm on the Verizon network due to excellent international capabilities and network coverage in the US. I thought about the iPhone but AT&T; coverage in my area is spotty.I find the Storm to be very fiddly. I am not a fan of the Storm's touch screen, and for typing it is a major headache. I try to avoid using it for emails now, which basically defeats the purpose. It also has major delays (for example, if I have not used the phone for a couple of hours, and I have an incoming call, often the little ""clock symbol"" pops up in the middle of the screen which means you can't do anything with the phone until it stops. Which means I miss my calls). This seems to be rectified (somewhat) by removing the battery once a day, but that's a bit of a silly way to keep your phone working properly.I don't hate the phone, and it has its advantages for travel, etc. But I think they need to improve the responsiveness of the touch screen and work out these delay-causing kinks. (sorry, I'm not very technical, not sure of the correct verbage!)I'm middle of the road on this phone - I wouldn't tell people not to buy it, but I would suggest they use it in the store for a bit to make sure they like the touch screen typing.For myself I will go with a more traditional keypad in the future, unless BB makes improvements on the touch screen - though I have two years to wait now!***Not even two months later and I am editing this review. The Storm is dreadful and will not work over 50% of the time it is turned on. The touch pad constantly malfunctions. Humidity seems to cause the problems. Kind of silly to have a phone that cannot handle simple humidity.Really, do not buy this phone. It is so not worth the money.","July 28, 2009",
mobile phone,Beware of Buggy Software,"SanjeevP ""Bottom Line""",RHJA5A2B2D5AO,3,"BlackBerry Storm is like a beautiful woman with a personality disorder: It will charm you with its gorgeous screen but make your life difficult with slow & buggy software that constantly freezes! Like you have an urgent call to make and phone is locked up for 2 minutes!BlackBerry Storm has hung up 3 times in one week that I have had it compared to my previous Palm Treo 755p which did that only twice in last one year. Once it freezes, you have to remove the cover, take the battery out and put it back in and then it takes 2-3 minutes to boot up. Buggy & sluggish software feels like Windows Mobile rather than Palm or iPhone.Pros:1.Beautiful high resolution screen2.Very Good email device3.Great Verizon coverage and better voice compared to other networks.4.Fast 3G compared to iPhone although browser is not as good.5. Bluetooth modem tethers and works well but I got download speed of 198 Kbs compared to 700-900 Kbs that I used to get with Treo 755p through the cable.Cons:1.Half baked software that freezes a lot.2.Very sluggish software, takes a while to respond - compared to Treo 755p & iPhone.3.User interface nowhere close to user friendliness and slickness of iPhone or Palm Treo 755p. You have to go through several menus and taps to do simple things for example you have to go through two screens and taps to put phone in vibrate mode.4.Voice quality inferior than Palm Treo 755p but better than iPhone.5.Poor desktop sync software. On Mac it either syncs contacts & calendar with PocketMac; or the media with iTunes with MediaSync- not both. And once you install MediaSync, you cannot use PocketMac!6.Only syncs playlists, not Podcasts.7.Unable to play audiobooks from Audible.com, as of February 2009.8.Does not fast forward or reverse audio or video.9.Long shutter lag with camera and even though it is supposed to be 3.2 megapixel, picture quality is not very good.10.No Wi-Fi.11.Fairly heavy at 155 gm and not easily pocketable like Palm Centro.12.Bluetooth plays stereo but constantly disconnects.13. Accelerometer very sensitive, keeps changing keyboard from portrait to landscape and vice versa even when you do not want to.BlackBerry Storm replaced my Palm Treo 755p which I really liked except for its bulk, browser and lack of Wi-Fi. I was hoping to replace 2 devices - Treo 755p & iPod - with Storm but its software is buggy & sluggish and voice quality poor compared to Palm Treo 755p; and media player does not sync Podcasts and play as well as iPod. After using BlackBerry Storm for 2 weeks, I returned it in my 30 day trial period and replaced it with a snappy Palm Centro that responds instantly to pressing the button. And now using Storm seems like a bad nightmare!","February 23, 2009",
mobile phone,Why I got rid of my Storm and bought an iPhone,Douglas A. Greenberg,R3KJQW3CCDSRT0,3,"I purchased a Blackberry Storm three months ago. It was my first ""smart phone."" I wanted to stick with Verizon and this seemed like the best choice. Last week, however, I cancelled my Verizon Blackberry service and switched to an iPhone. Yes, I had to pay a cancellation fee to Verizon, but I don't care. This review explains why I made this switch and I'm GLAD I did.The Storm is not really a bad product. It does some things very well, i.e., those things that Blackberry devices as a group do well. If your major concern is to gain access to email quickly and efficiently, the Storm will not disappoint. You can configure the Storm for multiple email accounts and have all of the emails come up in a single ""messages"" folder, something you can't do with an iPhone. It's also convenient to have the choice of deleting emails just on the device or on the server, as well. I found the SureType system for entering text to be easy to use once learned. Many people hate SureType, but with some patience and practice I found it to be terrific. For those who prefer a traditional full keyboard, the recent software upgrade incorporated a full vertical QWERTY keyboard to complement the previously provided horizontal one.I found the click screen adequately responsive, and the incorporation of swiping and finger-hovering functions is useful. Inputting calendar entries takes a bit of practice with these swiping/hovering techniques, but after a few days I had mastered the skill. The calendar function itself is sophisticated and integrates well with the phone and contacts features. The option to create multiple calendars is a useful feature. And as other reviewers have commented, the clarity of the screen is excellent. The browser system is good and includes a convenient ""home screen"" where one can search or access bookmarks easily and quickly. The battery is removable, and media can be stored on removable mini-SD cards (an 8 gb card is included).The various features of the Storm are accessible via small, iPhone-like icons on the home screen, which can be arranged as one wishes. Phone features are quite extensive, although the audio quality of phone calls leaves something to be desired.So--as a ""Blackberry,"" the Storm performs adequately and its touch-screen features make it find of fun to use. Moreover, recent software updates have ameliorated some of the performance issues that plagued early users. That's the good news.Now comes the bad news. The Storm has been billed as an ""iPhone killer,"" competition for Apple's highly successful product. It's in this head-to-head competition that the Storm falls significantly short. The fundamental problem seems to be that whereas the iPhone was designed from the beginning to be a multifunction device, the Storm apparently was based upon a design that is not really ideal for what the engineers were asked to accomplish here. The most annoying problems stem from the fact that the Storm is endowed with only very limited application memory. Apparently each time the Storm is started up at least some of this limited application memory is taken up by all of the installed programs. If one installs more than a very few ""apps"" that use significant memory, the device's overall performance suffers. Moreover there are continuing problems of ""memory leakage."" Over the course of a day during which apps are opened and closed the available memory slowly seeps away until the Storm slows to a crawl and to regain speed one has to do a ""battery pull"" to reboot the system and free up application memory. It is telling that one of the most popular applications used by Storm owners is ""Quick Pull,"" a program that functions to reboot the system without the necessity of physically removing the battery.One can slow this memory leakage by using the pulldown menus to close apps each time they are used, rather than simply hitting the ""red phone"" stop button to put them away (still open in the background, apparently). This can be a pain: sometimes closing out of an app requires a multiple-step process that becomes laborious. Even if one carefully closes each application the memory leakage proceeds anyway, albeit more slowly. I could never get through an entire day without rebooting the device at least once. Since this takes several minutes, it can be truly inconvenient.This memory problem poisons the entire Storm user experience. With much fanfare, Blackberry opened up its ""app store"" not long ago. There are not nearly as many apps available as there are for the iPhone (that's putting it mildly), but theoretically, most of the tasks that iPhone apps perform can now be accomplished through corresponding Storm apps. The bigger problem is that whereas iPhone users can add literally scores of apps to their phones will no real loss of speed, Storm owners must be oh, so careful not to overload their devices and thus slow the operating system down. I recall that when I finally decided to delete the preinstalled Verizon VZ Navigator program the Storm suddenly performed much better overall.As an entertainment device the Blackberry is barely adequate. It includes a music player that exhibits good sound quality but the system for adding music and synchronizing media with one's computer does not compare with Apple's iTunes. I ultimately found it easier to simply remove the 8gb mini-SD card and transfer my own music files directly to the card, rather than downloading the overpriced Verizon V Cast media or trying to synchronize and upload my music using the provided buggy, slow Roxie software. Moreover, some music fans (like me) will be disappointed that there is no gapless playback with the Storm (meaning that successive tracks that are meant to play nonstop with no gaps will exhibit an annoying instant of interruption).The Storm can play movies; in fact, the device comes preloaded with a very impressive film preview clip (""Babylon AD"")that appears bright and bold on the screen. However, it is difficult to impossible to buy or rent videos to download to the Storm. One can buy programs that enable users to rip DVD's and configure them for the Storm, but compare this ""convenience"" to the availability of prepared videos for sale or rent via iTunes.As a photographer, I can attest that all cameras incorporated into cell phones are terrible. The Storm's has some nice features, including a tiny flash and a (digital) zoom function, but the resulting images (and videos) are not very good. The iPhone once lagged in this area (i.e., no video camera) but with the release of the new 3Gs model the devices are now equally mediocre when it comes to photography.Other Storm problems: It's a good idea to lock the screen when the device is not in use; otherwise pressure on the screen can accidentally start programs and problems ensue. The iPhone uses a top-lock button to lock its screen and finger-slide to unlock it. The Blackberry has a top lock button to both lock and unlock the screen. The problem is that sometimes one clicks on the button to unlock the screen and there is no apparent response. Naturally, one clicks the button again, only to find that the screen finally unlocks but then locks again. This small performance issue can be quite annoying when one is trying to access Storm features during a busy day.Also, the Storm lacks WiFi. This is not a fatal flaw, but since WiFi where available is faster and uses less battery power, it's something that really should have been included.Overall, the iPhone is faster, easier to use, can do more, and definitely more fun. Apple excels at creating user-friendly products that get the little things right. The Storm is Blackberry's first attempt at a consumer-oriented smart phone, and it's clearly a work in progress. There may eventually be multifunction phone products that will rival the iPhone, but the Storm is not a serious challenger.","June 28, 2009",
mobile phone,Not ready for primetime,Greenband,RXO1WW4D8RFHF,3,"I have owned the Blackberry Storm since the first day it was released.The phone is like a bottle of wine that holds a lot of promise after aging 5-10 years but not drinkable now.The phones software and applications are not remotely ready - the applications don't work well with the touch screen, switching between portrait/landscape is troublesome, etc. I could literally list 50 different examples of core functionality not working well.I'm hoping that that future software/firmware updates corrects the many bugs.If you are not a business user with stringent requirements around Microsoft Exchange integration (calendar/email/contacts) than get an iPhone. If you are still think about getting a Storm, wait until Blackberry has a desktop version of the software newer than 17-Nov-08 (version 4.7.0 B50).","December 7, 2008",
mobile phone,Love hate relationship... Hate won.,USNAVYVET2002,RZIRSPIT6PSDZ,3,"Well, perhaps hate is a strong word here. I don't hate the Storm. I wanted to like it so much that I gave it a solid week even after telling myself I was returning it the next day. Bottom line is, what I really wanted was an iphone, but I didn't want AT&T.; So I went with the Storm, as I think Verizon's network is simply the best. So...Pros and cons of the Storm (with .75 update):Pros:Excellent looking screenDecent AppsReceiving E-mail is greatIt's a BlackberryCons:The screens flips to landscape at odd times and then lagsActually using the phone was a cumbersome pain; sound quality is poorUsing the tactile click seemed cool at first, but texting was abysmalEverything was very, very slow even after shutting down appsCamera would turn on for no apparent reason; unacceptableMy ear would actually select another voice mail when using visual voice mail.Did I mention typing anything was a huge pain in the derriere?So, on day six I decided to get the ipod touch 16Gb (no, not the phone). I was literally blown away at how smooth and responsive it was. The Storm was a clumsy oaf in comparison with the interface and apps.The next day, today, I went to the Verizon store and returned it for an LG EnV Touch and the thing is great. I mean, I can actually use the phone and feel like I am talking into a real phone. I can text with ease and not be frustrated. It may not be the powerhouse that the Storm is, but I'll take usability over flash any day.Suggestions: The Storm could be great if it were quicker, much quicker and if it gave the option between simple touch or the tactile click.","June 21, 2009",

mobile phone,"Too soon to tell, But frustrating",Benjamin Kroell,R67V3Y0Y3CL58,3,"I've had this phone for approximately a week now. I upgraded from my VX 8700 flip-phone to the Blackberry Storm. So with this in mind, my perception and exprience with the newest Blackberry addition my vary from more experienced smart phone users. Here's the first thing I noticed:The phone looks smooth and the screen is very bright and vivid. It looks pretty basic- only 4 buttons, large icons, it just looked simple yet luxurious. The main downside to The Storm, is the touch-screen. In a way it sort of evens itself out. Because although the keyboard and Sure-Press capability may not be that easy or accurate, it does make up for it with its large screen. I text a lot so when I first got the phone I tried to text and found it extremely frustrating. It got to the point where I just stopped and if I received a text message I would be upset because I didn't want to attempt to text them back. However, with the switch to any new phone comes adaptation.The features that come with this phone don't seem very clear or easily accessible. For example, today I woke up and my phone will not connect with the internet. I tried searching ways to fix this or for a number I could call, but there it's confusing when trying to flip through all the options.I'm keeping this review short because I've only had the phone for a week and I don't feel like I have a complete understanding of it yet. I'm sure I will become more comfortable with it.","April 20, 2009",

mobile phone,"BLACKBERRY ""Sturm und Drag"" 9530.","PLU ""MPLU11""",R1PWRWZU0L257U,3,"Purchased the BB STORM 9530 cell phone a few months ago with great anticipation. It has been anything but! First off, I am very disappointed in in the ""touch"" screen itself! Yes, you have to slightly depress it to get that clickish feeling, but it is a MAJOR hassle to type a text / email. If you don't place your fingertips directly over the letter / number, you will be constantly correcting your mistakes. There is NO WAY one can type at a fast pace on this phone! It seems like you are relegated to almost ""one finger"" typing in order to complete a text. Plus, the auto dictionary feature keeps changing routine words to other words, so you have to backspace, then hit the space bar to proceed. Very annoying, to say the least! The other thing about the screen is that is is NOT sealed around the edges, so dirt and moisture can seep in underneath it. I accidentally found this out when I spilled a little water on it. I quickly dried it up and figured I had saved my phone from catastrophe. The next morning, my imaging on the phone was ""cloudy"" plus the BB kept turning itself off! I took the battery out and let the phone ""dry"" itself out. This worked, but a sealed screen would have prevented this! (Also, make sure you have a screen protector on it to avoid smudges on your screen.) My last complaint is that the browsing experience is very slooooooooooow and tedious. Again, the touch screen is not user friendly in this case, either! To be honest, surfing the Internet on ANY cell phone is not even worth the trouble.....I'd rather do it on my PC at home. If I had to make a sound choice on a BB, it wouldn't be this one. (It does have some nice features plus is sleek and stylish, but not enough to overcome these issues!) I actually like the newer BB TOUR 9630.....it's more my type of phone. Oh well, the STORM is my phone until my official upgrade date arrives.....in 2011. (Sigh!)","September 27, 2009",
mobile phone,"Great device but email, calendar and contacts without BES is poor.",Donad Lott,R2M32KTULRBQG5,3,"First I'd like to start by saying that this is my first BlackBerry and while there are a lot of cool things about the Storm, there are some drawbacks when compared to other devices. I have used a Windows Mobile phone for the past 4 years and have enjoyed easy wireless sync of email, contacts, calendar and tasks to our Exchange OWA server. I'd like to mention easy because it was just that. No hassle, no IT involvement and best of all, no additional cost beyond having an unlimited data plan. So this is the standard to which I set my experience. Keep in mind that this is mostly a comparison of ""over the air"" sync.So why switch...well, I got tired of the inherent lag/sluggishness of Windows Mobile phones and wanted a change. Figuring that the BlackBerry has been in the email market the longest, it seemed a safe bet. Unfortunately the email sync was probably the greatest disappointment of the entire device. It's too bad too because the rest of the phone is very well put together. Since most other email friendly smart phones have ActiveSync built in, they can seamlessly sync over the air with Exchange. The Storm however cannot if there isn't a corporate BES server available. If there is, you need to purchase the more expensive data plan at $45/mo as opposed to the personal data plan at $29. I don't understand why but that's just how it is. Only with a BES server on the back-end, will you enjoy full email sync including calendar and contacts. One other annoying thing is how it's charged/sync'd. I purchased the OEM cradle and while the single USB cable will charge/sync simultaneously, it won't do either if your computer goes into standby, which mine does after 20 mins of idle. I woke up this morning to find my phone fully sync'd to the PC, but with a dead battery.This is probably what will prompt me to return the phone and go back to my Windows Mobile. I'm disappointed too because the responsiveness of the phone is very good and I am really enjoying the push screen. It makes a world of difference over other touchscreen only phones. Plus, the built-in email, calendar and contact apps are very well designed. The layout is nice and easy to read and edit. Yes you can use a cable to sync calendar, contacts, email, etc but all devices can do that so I don't really consider that a reason to buy.I'm looking for a phone that supports easy wireless sync of email, contact and calendar, voice-dial via BlueTooth, plays media, supports MMS and has good performance (not a WinMobile).

mobile phone,"Some Good, Some Bad",NC guy,REZ1RBP6XROHQ,3,"I was very excited to get this phone, but i do have to admit that once i had it for a few days i was disappointed. I also have a Blackberry Curve, and it has stood by me through everything. I think i could drive over it with my car and it would survive. Always, the Storm had a lot of hype behind it and i wanted to get one.Some of the good: I loved that you could turn the phone to its side and get a horizontal keyboard. This really helps with texting and sending emails. You are also able to send MMS something the iPhone doesnt offer. I love the blackberry platform, and the ease of use for the phone.The Bad: The phone froze a lot, and i found myself having to remove the battery to do a reset. It took sometime to get use to the fact that i had to press down the screen and ""click"" it. This was different that what i was use to with the iPhone and the Instinct.I got rid of the phone, it seem to always need something looked. I think it is like the first iPhone, and they have some kinks to work out.","June 2, 2009",

mobile phone,"Good phone with ""Quirks""",Rangera33,R1RE5F55DTN7YS,3,"I'm writing this review from the perspective of an American who lives and travels overseas. Because of this, I was looking for an unlocked, quad-band GSM phone that had 3G, Wifi, GPS, a decent screen size for video and a good app selection. Plus, I wanted this all at a reasonable price since I would not be getting any plan subsidy. Using this criteria the 5800 seemed perfect and there are a lot of great things about this phone for the traveler which I'll go into later. The main negative I found was that the American version of this handset and the others in its product line do not support 3G outside of the Americas. The 5800 American edition does not support the UMTS (3G) 2100 frequency (Wikipedia has an entry under ""list of UMTS networks"" that show which carriers use which frequency). Now the point can be made that I bought American edition and shouldn't be surprised that it won't pick up 3G in other countries. The only problem is that almost all of Nokia's other American version 3G handsets like the N97, X6 and E75 (my wife's phone)do support the 2100 frequency. To be fair, the 5800 will support EDGE networks wherever you want to go and if you use a browser like opera mini, you may not even notice that much of a difference in general web browsing. It's just something to consider if you are looking at this as an international travel phone and a fast data connection is important to you.Now the 5800 does have some very nice features for the traveler that should be noted. First and foremost is the ability to pre-install free Ovi maps in your phone before you get on the plane. This allows you to use the 5800's GPS with voice directions without an active data connection. This is something that other free mapping services, like Google maps, cannot do. Of course you could go with third party software like Ndrive and pay up to $70 per map. Personally, I'll go with free. Of course with Nokia there is usually a catch. This one is that not every Nokia handset that has a GPS gets free Ovi maps. The 5800 does but my wife's E75, a phone released the same year and is much more expensive than the 5800, does not. If you are looking at other other Nokia phones and this feature is important to you, then check make sure the phone can use free Ovi maps.Another important travel feature is that the 5800 has Wifi. If you spend time overseas, you will probably be buying local pre-paid sim cards (the 5800's quad-band GSM capability lets you do that everywhere) with no or expensive data service. Therefore, Wifi is essential. Find a free hot spot at a coffee shop and you can check your email, tweet, update your Facebook and make Skype calls back home. The Nokia catch here is that connecting with Wifi can be a mysterious and confusing process. You would think that once you hook up to a Wifi connection then that the phone would automatically use that connection as the default. We'll you would be wrong. The first thing you need to do is go into all your applications that go online and insure that the default connection is set to ""always ask"". That way you can select the connection you want the app to use. If you don't then the 5800 may or may not use the free Wifi connection and instead drain the money out of your sim card without you noticing.As for long train, plane and automobile rides, the 5800 is a very decent media player. It has a standard 3.5mm audio jack and the music playback is very good quality. The screen is on the small side for video, coming in at 3.2 inches, but it is very high res at 360 by 640 and hence the video is sharp and clear. The screen is also in 16:9 widescreen format that means that the black bar problem on widescreen movies is not so noticeable. You will need to convert your videos to the MP4 format for the installed Real Player, but you would want to do that anyway to bring the file size down. Nokia also provides a generous 8 GB micro SD card, that can be upgraded to 16 GB. That means that right out of the box you can put a lot of media on the phone, without having to spend money on a bigger SD card.As for apps, the 5800 uses the S60V5 software and the phone has been out long enough that there are a fair amount of apps for the phone. You may have to dig for it, but pretty much everything I want the 5800 to do, and I want it to do a quite a lot, there is an app out there to let me do it. The difference with Apple and Android is that you may have 10 flavors of apps to do the 1 task you want, while with S60v5 you will probably only have one. The Nokia catch here is that S60V5 is a tough operating system to get to know and work with. It is not intuitive and can be initially very frustrating, but with time you get used to it's quirks and there's lot's of support on-line in different forums to help you learn the ropes.In the end I was looking for a phone that if I was traveling very light could do all the things a basic netbook could do. Despite it's lack of 3G outside North and South America, the 5800 does meet those expectations. With a small folding Bluetooth keyboard (The Iphone won't let you do that yet) and a battery backup charger (get one that uses either AA or AAA batteries so you can keep replacing the batteries)I can watch movies, listen to music, write long emails or notes and play games for all of my long haul flights and layovers. There is even an e-book app (ereader) that works pretty well if you bump the font up. Then when I finally do get to my destination, I can fire up the GPS and load a local sim card and I'm moving and communicating in no time. All this for a reasonable price without a contract.There is no question that Nokia delivers great hardware value with their handsets. The challange for Nokia will be to develop a operating system with plenty of apps that let's the user smoothly and easily take advantage of all that great hardware. With stores in the US selling $99 dollar 8GB IPhone 3GSs (with a two year contract), there is becoming less and less reason for folks to put up with Nokia's ""Quirks.""","June 19, 2010",
mobile phone,GPS poor but phone is a marvel,Robert K. Wetmore,R3QCDVA07ZF7HJ,3,"If you are buying this for the GPS function, think again. As many others have commented, it takes forever for this phone to figure out where it is. That makes it pretty useless for around the town driving. In addition, it has a pathetic accuracy level. It regularly told me that I was 300 yards from a turn when I was already in the left turn lane and only 20 feet from the intersection. Suddenly it realized where it was and told me to turn left.In addition, the GPS works much better if it is A-GPS, which uses your phone network as a part of its navigation process. That uses up valuable minutes on my phone service that I am not interested in donating to AT&T.; That's especially significant because we want a GPS for long voyages. You can use it without the A-GPS, but it's not nearly as good.Beyond the GPS, the phone is astonishing. The screen is gorgeous and watching movies on it is a blast. It sounds good and it's easy to use. Others have complained about the interface, but I don't think it's a problem. If you don't care about the GPS, then buy it in a second. Oh, the WIFI is blazing fast, as fast as my new laptop almost and the resolution is great.","July 13, 2010",
mobile phone,"OK phone, ok support, all around ok","Brenton E. Defaria ""BEF""",R703YCJ8BTTQ4,3,"This should be a 3.5 star review. I have used this phone for almost a year now and so far it has been ok. The phone is a touch phone that comes with a little stylus, which is lost easily but very cheap and easy to replace if you buy spares on eBay. I barely use the stylus because I find it annoying, but when you want to press a smaller detail on the phone it's good to have. The display sort of looks like a wanna be iphone, and it responds fairly well to commands. The camera is nice and the video records fairly clear which is also nice.I have had to send mine in for service twice since I bought it, the first time for them to tighten the seams around when the phone locks and unlocks (it is a little switch that you push up to lock or unlock, which I find annoying and looks like it might break if you accidently push it too hard) which were coming loose, and the second time because my screen went black. While this was annoying, the good thing was that it happened within the warranty period so the fixed it for free both times. If you think somethign (and I mean anything)is wrong with the phone, call Nokia right away and don't linger until your warranty expires or else the won't fix it for free.The Bad-The phone is a fingerprint magnet and you will be constantly wiping-The screen is sort of plasticity feeling and not as nice as other touch screens-The phone is too thick, and if you get a cover(which you do need) it gets even thicker-The stylus is annoying and is easily lost-The graphics mess-up and freeze all the time, sometimes distort and you have to lock and unlock, or even reset in extreme cases, to fix them-Every couple of months the phone will get stuck and vibrate uncontrollably, you'll need to reset it to fix-It can sometimes get confused with orientation and won't known whether to be vertical or horizontal when you text-The setting take a little while to figure outThe Good-The phone is the nicest touch phone you'll find at such a low price-The customer service is helpful-It is very resilient for a touch phone and has withstood many falls and bangs (in part thanks to the case)-It seems like it will last you a couple years-It's a nice phone for someone on a budget who wants to get something a little nicer than a basic phone-You can browse the internet-You can download some apps and different features-I have never seen anyone else with the same phone at least here in Florida, and it seems to be a little more uncommon in the US, so you'll probably be the only person you know that owns one (which can be a good or a bad thing I guess)In conclusionIf you want a nice not too expensive touch phone, with some web capability get this phone, but if you're looking for and iphone or Android substitute look elsewhere. If you want a nice phone that will last you at least a year or two try this one out.","March 25, 2011",
mobile phone,Nokia 5800 XpressMusic,BigStory,R3QHGDS4OK1WRG,3,"I've owned the Nokia 5800 XpressMusic since July 2009. Prior to the Nokia 5800 I had an old Nokia from 2005. I bought this because it had a decent video camera/camera(compared to my old Nokia) and the ability to browse the internet(my old Nokia could barely perform that function). After a year and a half, the results are mixed.The video cam is convenient to use but the results are just ok. In broad daylight the picture is clear. But in any other lighting condition degradation is rapid. Browsing the internet isn't that smooth because the 5800's touch-screen is either overly sensitive sometimes or it just takes a slegdehammer to register an input. This results in many mis-clicks which waste time and mobile bandwidth.The audio quality of the phone is pretty good. The switching function between horizontal and vertical screen is eratic and seems to switch to horizontal when I want it vertical and vertical when I need it horizontal, so I just turn off the auto-turn feature. Unfortunately there is no option to switch. Either it is stationary or it turns eratically on its own.With the updates the phone functions a little smoother. Originally there is the full/mini QWERTY keyboard along with handwriting, now with the update there is an alphanumeric keypad. The build-quality of the phone feels nice but it is a bit bulky and the little writing tool can easily get lost. Reception is always strong with this phone. Overall a decent phone that's a bit pricey and can be frustrating to use.","January 13, 2011",
mobile phone,Good Phone - Rough Interface,Anup S. Nair,R3Q9R74JLK6NAH,3,"This is a good phone, but the interface is a bit rough. When i say rough it really means that it is quite difficult to find some thing on the phone. I would also like to highlight that wireless connection breaks very often, and you are not notified if this happens.","January 15, 2010",
mobile phone,Good but not Great,Winter,R2KRPX59LTY1DE,3,"IMPORTANT NOTE: This phone is carrier-unlocked. It means that the phone itself does not require you to go with any one specific carrier in order to use it: you just buy it, swap your SIM card (if compatible), and start using. HOWEVER: if you are not currently on an unlimited data plan with your carrier, you absolutely MUST call your wireless carrier and talk to them about the phone. The Nokia XpressMusic 5800 has a lot of settings that default to using your wireless carrier to pull down data, and using these features (or in some cases just having them turned on) when your carrier bills you for data by the kilobit WILL lead to astronomically high phone bills. I had a long conversation with AT&T; Service prior to purchasing this phone and their representative indicated to me that many people don't realize the hidden cost of their phone's features when not signed up for an unlimited data plan. Before you buy, take 10 minutes to call your carrier. It can save you a lot of headaches.The Nokia 5800 XpressMusic is an excellent phone for people who love media: it's got a browser for streaming, easy-to-use software for transfers of your own files, and it even has a built-in FM radio for listening to local stations (with the added bonus of being able to tag and label them). The screen is approximately the size of the screen on a Nintendo DS or the older Sony PSP, with the difference being that colors are brighter, resolution is sharper, and the backlight is superior. Power button, standard headphone adapter, charge plug and USB connector are all on the top, making it easy to access but conveniently out of the way. The touch screen is unlocked via a rocker key on the side, and volume can easily be adjusted up or down along the same edge.In addition to this, you can expect all the same features you find in most smartphones today: GIS-driven mapping systems, Internet connectivity via WiFi (if, like me, you're not on an unlimited data plan), a multitude of Bluetooth capabilities, integration with a PC or Mac via the USB Cable, and of course a digital camera that takes good (but not great) pictures and video. One nice extra here is that if you hold the phone like a camera, a button on top will quickly switch the phone to camera mode and also double as your auto-focus and picture-taking button.I like the feel of this phone, and I definitely like the clarity and strength of the calls. There are times when it appears that I have only one bar, but still can place clear and noise-free calls that don't disconnect. The software is regularly kept up to date, and once you get through the process of setting up an account at the Ovi Store, it is remarkably easy to download and install applications, many of which are free (but only some of which are useful).The one big drawback--and it is a serious one--is the interface. Features and Applications are in two separate sections, and sometimes the dividing line between which is which is not exactly clear. The auto-rotate that switches from Portrait to Landscape can go off at the slightest of bumps, and I have to shake the phone and wait for it to re-set. I bought the phone because I wanted a good, solid handwriting device, and this is where I have been most disappointed. Despite being a whiz at PDAs, despite training (and re-training) the phone to my handwriting, I get many botched translations. I have to force myself to scribe slowly because the delay time between reading my strokes and rendering a character is noticeably long. I have to patiently re-do most of my strokes over and over. To give credit where credit is due, Nokia gives you a slim stylus cleverly hidden along the side of the phone, and then they throw in a hip little gadget called a ""plectrum"": it's a triangular guitar-pick that makes a handy substitute for a fingernail--consider this for pointing and clicking and the stylus for handwriting.There is, however, one sin that seems unforgivable, and I'm surprised that a year and a half down the road, the updates still haven't addressed it:The phone dialer has no letters on it.Let me rewind that: if you call up the dialer in other areas of the phone (such as via contacts), you will see the letters imprinted on the dial pad. However, if you want to dial a number with letters in it (say, ""1-800-FLOWERS""), you are out of luck: the dialer shown when dialing the phone does not display any letters. The fact that the letters are imprinted elsewhere in the system, but not where they are most important, is what makes the lack of this ""fix"" annoying.Also, while the software is easy to use, it is also incredibly slow and buggy in Windows Vista or Windows 7. The interface often turns black and I have to scrub my mouse over the window to re-draw my menus and panels.If you really like media and want a phone for music, pictures, and video, the 5800 XpressMusic is not bad. However, if you're looking for a pocket-sized computer that can do whiz-kid propeller-head tricks, the 5800XpressMusic will most likely disappoint, especially given its price. As much as I appreciate what Nokia was trying to do with this phone, it really wasn't significantly different from my Motorola RAZR.NOTE: I cannot confirm that this is true of all Nokia 5800 XpressMusic phones, but the ""USA"" Phone that was shipped to me contained a European power adapter. This huge chunk of plastic contains a converter to allow it to plug into US electrical outlets, but it also means that your charger is anything but pocket-sized. I sent mine in for a replacement, only to discover that the replacement also contained the same ""Euro-plus-converter-widget"" charger.","January 21, 2010",
mobile phone,"Great Phone, terrible camera",Nick Farrell,R2OTSE14I5KXFB,3,"First off I want to say this and that in the 2 days that I used this phone I thought it was fantastic. The screen looked great, the touchscreen was responsive (for a resistive touch anyway), Gps worked good, Joikuspot, video playback looked great, i thought S60 worked well on the device and it had a reasonable price. The only thing that kept me from loving this phone was the horrendous camera quality. I ended up returning this phone and getting an N85 because of how bad the camera on this phone was. The pictures were grainy even in bright natural light, and no matter what I did with the white balance or color settings i couldn't get rid of the purple hue over all of the pictures. Howver, if you are someone who doesn't really care about a camera, then I guess I would recommend this phone, but If you value camera quality like I do, look somewhere else or you will be dissapointed.","July 19, 2009",
mobile phone,What Customer Service?,P. Kelly,R3GX02CGM8BSTZ,3,"Bought this phone almost a week ago. I am still trying to update the firmware. I use Windows 7. The enclosed cd refuses to work. It says I have no internet connection, but I do. Then I downloaded the OVI suite to try an update that way. Had a horrible time trying to get the download to install. I finally got it to install as ""administrator"" on the 3rd attempt. Once installed, I tied to update the phone and it still won't update firmware via OVI suite. I then attempted to update via the phone itself via wireless connection. Keep getting as error this way too. I don't think it is a firewall issue. But feel lost. I've called Nokia customer service. Each time you get a nice lady with a heavy foreign accent. I mention this because it is hard to communicate back and forth. The first time I called the lady said I must contact my internet provider for assistance. Well they had no clue as to why since my internet was working and everything attached worked. Called Nokia back again and the nice lady promised that a technician would contact me withing 24 to 48 hours. Never happened. Called back a 3rd time and the nice lady said she was going to look for my records and after 10 minutes never came back on the phone. This is all too frustrating. The phone itself works alright, but I am unable to download OVI maps because I have outdated firmware.One last complaint. I cannot find an app for internet music? I found one on the Nokia site but it was for older models. I have a Nokia N8100 internet tablet and it has a great internet music app. Can't believe this phone doesn't. I am about to give up and send this back.Update. On the 7th day...I tried once again to update the firmware via wifi & phone and it connected and updated on first attempt! Great. But another thing happened that is really strange. A call came in and the phone vibration started. But it would not stop. It just kept vibrating and the keys locked up. After a couple of minutes I just pulled the battery and inserted it and it was alright. Strange phone.","June 25, 2010",

mobile phone,"Good for price, but iphone killer its not",craig,R253RVNE3TE5I8,3,"First off, when I was looking for a basic (unlocked), no bells and whistle phone. But couldnt find one that fit my needs. (Purchased a supposed basic unlocked Motorola off Ebay, different story, but lesson learnt, don't trust Ebay)I have a new Ipod touch, so did really want apps, wifi and media. But after being unsuccessful in a basic phone search, I thought about getting a full featured phone and eliminate my itouch. After reading all the reviews about this phone and seeing the price of an Iphone (well out of budget), I decided on this nokia.Once receiving this phone, setting it up and with playing some java games on the device. Upon using I immediatly realized that this phone is not even close to the same ballpark as apple products.Comparing this nokia to my itouch (pretty much a iphone), I began to notice that this phone is not as refined as apple options.1) The screen is a pain to use, even with the stylus, screen feels soft, not as sensitive and annoying. It gets scratched easily, my ipod is 12 months old and not a mark to be seen, this phone is now 2 weeks old and has a few deep marks. I have purchased protector to eliminate this.2) The apps and games available for this phone are terrible, I have downloaded 20-30 java games and apps for this phone and have deleted all but two. Graphics, game play and entertainment on all games is terrible. I have downloaded (not purchased) awful games from itunes, but then there are some great games. The graphics of these java games remind me of my first ever gameboy and I would prefer to use the gameboy as the on-screen function of the nokia is crap.3) This phone has issues, it freezes at times and you get a solid blue screen, shutting down and a minute later and the phone is fine (happened twice in two weeks).This phone is great as a phone (only as a phone), easy to use, great for contact detail, good battery life (3-4 days with minimal use, 1-3 with moderate)great sound for media/calls and acceptable Wifi. For the price I think this phone has great value, it was one of the cheapest I could find with wifi, great for music and movies (forget games and apps). I travel a bit and basic phone Wifi is great to check emails and facebook at free hotspots.In the end I will keep this phone it does what I require, but I will still be keeping my ipod touch, its just so much more enjoyable to use. My advice if you have/can justify the money get a unlocked Iphone, if not this nokia will suffice.","August 30, 2010",

Ortiz,R232ADW5XH83A9,3,"The Nokia 5800 is a good phone but has its downsides:Pros:- Touch screen is responsive- The full keyboard is spacious- Has a stylus but isn't really needed- Feels sturdy- Comes with 8GB of storage- Decent camera for a cell phone,- Internet browsing is decent- Comes with Wifi and Bluetooth- Good music player/radioCons:- The memory card is very hard to remove. BE CAREFUL. When I tried removing it to transfer data via SD slot, the card was such a tight fit the chip was damaged. I had to buy another memory card. It hasn't happened again but just the fact this is possible is a fatal flaw in its design.- The accelerometer is too sensitive.Overall:It's a good phone and affordable, however, not good for anything other than calling or listening to music. If you want an internet device, go with the higher end smart phones (iPhone, Blackberry, Droid, etc)","January 12, 2010",

I called Amazon to see how I would go about getting it replaced,..and they couldn't help me because it was after 30 days of the purchase...so where does my full year warranty come in? well i contacted Nokia as well...the customer service was not good...and they basically told me they wouldnt replace my phone...i'd have to send it in and wait until they fix it (supposedly) and send it back.

mobile phone,Needs improvement,"Francesco Sensidoni ""sensi""",R3Q2E8LD9DNNM7,3,"I like the phone, but it is hard to use if you are constantly on the run.

Even for dailing a contact, you first have to select the contact, then press call, and then your prompt with another menu were you have to choose voice call so that dials..... I do like the touch screen, but i think the ram of this phone is not good enough as it freezes constantly. Battery is not the best but it does hold one entire day and a half. It would be good if this phone came with the fm transmitter as the N version. I think is good considering the price, but it could be improved with minor work on it.

mobile phone,"Good features, not so good with processing/construction",Danny Sees,R33R1MNNZHPZK2,3,"I truly loved this phone for roughly the first 4 months or so. After that time, I have had to either turn off+turn back on the phone or blindly touch the right section of the screen to access the web browser for the screen to start working properly again. It also gets stuck frequently, some times for a few seconds - some times I need to take out the battery and power up the phone all over again.The features listed here and on Nokia's website speak for themselves. The sound quality was better than 5 mp3 players ranging from $90-$400 (iPod Touch 3G, Samsung P3 & Q2, few others..) that I tested it against and this was a main selling point for me. It was basically a Samsung P3 with better sound and video while being a phone at the same time - all for the same price - with free movies, gift card, and accessories thrown in.Main point for my review is to let you know it's got some nice features for the money indeed, but be prepared for the possibility that it might not last so long. Hopefully you are lucky in this regard more so than I was. Jacked up screen and all, I still use my 5800 daily as an mp3 player - and of course as a cell-phone. When I'm in the car it's always connected for music and hands-free calls through the aux-port and it has taken some memorable videos for me when needed.Good luck and happy holidays","December 24, 2010",

Some problems,"Mario Sanchez Celedon ""Dr. Mario""",R1VNNH84JM690Q,3,"I bought this cell as a present for my father.It has a lot of nice features and the build quality is the standar expected one for a plastic cell phone.However, it has several things that just aren't right, let me explain:The cell phone JAMS for no particular reason, having to restart ir at least 2 times in a single day. Sometimes it doesn't responds to the power button so you have to take the battery off in order to restart the thing.GPS capabilities although nice, is too slow to get the satelites.Good reception, battery life and in call quality.Nokia should be more responsible for the products released under its name.

mobile phone,Good enough but don't get too exited,Robbie,R23JPL42UICTFP,3,I have owned this phone for a few months now and it generally works OK. I like the touch screen system and the screen resolution is good. the screen size is nice and large so you can clearly see whats happening. It comes with a memory card with sufficient capacity (7.6GB) for my needs. I have also used the WiFi capability to surf internet via wireless networks and it works fine.Unfortunately there are a few things I do not like:1) The phones battery life is poor and unpredictable!!!-even after you shut off Bluetooth and wireless scanning.2) Nokia ovi stopped working all of a sudden.3) The phone's volume is very low (Xpressmusic??). I could use my previous phone as an alarm but not this one.4) Forget about trying to take photos in less than perfect lighting- they will look grainy.5) The GPS works -but it takes rather long to get a position and the altitude accuracy is always terrible.6) if you access the touch screen dialer from main menu- you only get a numeric keypad not an alphanumeric (normal) one.,"March 13, 2010",

mobile phone,Died in 10 months,"Tampart1 ""Tampart1""",R3LB9DDGF70487,3,"I purchased this phone from Amazon in Nov 09; worked great until about a month ago(Aug 2010). About 2 or 3 times a week, it would lock up--if it was on, you could do nothing no matter which key you hit. I had to remove the battery and reinstall it and then it would work. If it was off, I had to remove the battery and reinstall it before it would turn on. Last week we went to Vegas, and the phone would not access the WiFi spots at any WiFi spot we went to. It would go into a loop and recognize the WiFi spot(like the airport), but you could not access the internet. It would say that it was logging on, and show a full bar, but it would then say ""connecting"", and go into a loop and get stuck there. When we got back yesterday, I contacted Nokia, and the lady I spoke with ran me thru a zillion scenarios before she agreed that there was a problem, and she sent me a return label for UPS so I could send it back for repair. I took it to a local UPS location today to return it. You have to remove the battery, sims card, and memory card before you send it back. Let's hope it works when I get it back.The GPS on this phone is really slow and only works part of the time. I have a Garmin, so fortunately I don't have to rely on the phone for gps.I have not used this phone for the music feature, but I understand this is a nice feature.","September 24, 2010",

I can press no number because the keyboard is always getting black and I HARDLY can keep it lighting up at least for the little moment I could press the number. It is just fleshing again and again.

mobile phone,I love it - but it had a problem,Try N2 Help,R3UIDPNOJXW4ZH,3,"I love this phone. The touch screen is just right, too much but tolerable garbage programs on it by Nokia that you cannot remove. Decent but not great call quality. I thought I would not like stylus but really like its accuracy. Surfing the web (on ATT) is great with this phone. Its biggest problem is dropping calls, shutting down, acting like ""memory overflow"" when browsing the web and shutting down the browser. These problems cured temporarily by removing battery. The more you use it the more often you must pull battery to reboot. Mine is going back to Nokia for warranty repair tomorrow. Hope that helps. It came with V20 software, upgraded to V21, but Nokia won't release the V30 software in US yet. Who knows, that may cure problem, but first they will have to spend their factory dollars to investigate since they won't give U.S. new software. Last Nokia I will ever buy. There must be a company that can make a phone with good hardware and/or software??? I wish it worked...... UPDATE 9-3-09: ZPhone was having so many problems, sent it in to their REPAIR depot. It came back in ONLY 6 DAYS and has worked PERFECTLY since. They noted they ""replaced crystal filter"". I really like this phone and feel it is perfect now. It does make me want a larger screen and the new 4 inch devices being released are very tempting (when we can buy them unlocked). I hope they are are good as this phone for usability.

For the first try at a touch phone, it's pretty good but there are just too many other touch phones that have already got the OS right.The Ovi store is still not worth going to. Only a few of the apps are even made for the 5800. And most of those were just ported over from the original app to be used with the 5800.The camera should be better. There is no excuse why a 3.2mp Nokia can't take a decent looking picture indoors.Overall I would say its a nice phone for the price but there are just too many phones out this summer to settle on this one.

I had this first for 3 weeks and then bought the 3GS and there is no comparison. Web browser, UI of the touchscreen, typing, apps all go to the iphone hands down. The Nokia doesn't even have any sort of check spelling or word correcting on it....seriously. And the screen would get caught in landscape mode and I would have to shake it vigoursly and then after 10 seconds or so it would rotate. I added quickoffice to both and with it for the iphone I can store any pdf's, word, and excel files directly on my iphone and view and email anytime so there isn't a need for an sd card. Being able to sync with itunes, which is what i use, is nice especially coming from the blackberry bold where it also synced effortlessly...on the nokia...yah..not even close. If you want a simple small touchscreen then I guess its ok but for anything else the iphone or maybe one of the new android or htc's coming out would be the way to go.","July 6, 2009",

mobile phone,"Great phone, bad battery life!",Kim,R32WPN1PQRF916,3,"Really liked this phone, liked the layout, how user friendly it is. I was worried about not liking the touch screen, but after using it I loved it!!! The only thing that we did not like is how long the battery didn't last and not being able to download apps. Just using the phone for a couple of phone calls and some texting the battery would not last a 8 hour work day without needing to be charged. When the battery got down to 20% the phone would shut off. The issue with not being able to download apps is not a huge problem, but having a Smart Phone one upside is being able to have apps... like angry birds!! Well we could not get them because the ios needed to be upgraded. I am not tech savy so I do not what this is or what it means, but really just some simple apps we could not get, (flashlight, weather). So for those two problems I give 3 stars. If you want a smart phone that is easy to use and has a touch screen this phone is good, but don't expect to be able to talk on the phone much because the battery will be dead in no time!","February 26, 2014",

It will all depend on who the supplier is and that seems to change from moment to moment.

mobile phone,"If the n97 were a real flagship, it would sink","John Newdick ""John Newdick""",R1QVCJRX0OLSWG,3,"When I first learned of the n97's release, I was excited. I had been waiting for Nokia to release another ground-breaking phone, like the n95 of years ago. The n96 wasn't it, nor was the n85. Then the n97 came - with a touchscreen and QWERTY keyboard to boot! I was sold at once, but did all of my research anyway and found it to be full of innovative ideas and modern must-haves. I bought it nearly two weeks ago at a reasonable discount from NokiasUSA after Amazon ran out of stock and jacked up the price.**If you read the specs, you will find all of the high points, but here are some more:-I found the phone to be fast and responsive when given input. The keyboard is phenomenal - the key spacing and feel is just right and the offset space bar is not as big of a deal as it is often made out to be. The only thing I could ask for is a little click to acknowledge the button was pushed, though if the sound is on, the phone makes a small noise. The keyboard could have been even bigger yet if they dropped the D-Pad, which I rarely find myself using as it is a touchscreen (maybe make it a secondary feature for other keys?).-The GPS unit quickly finds a satellite signal (faster than most Tom-Toms) and accurately places you on a detailed map. The turn-by-turn voice directions work well, except they do not read the street name. Best of all, it doesn't make you agree to do-not-drive-as-you-use-this-device waivers every time the program launches.-The call quality is excellent.-No contract and not bogged down with un-deletable carrier apps and tacky logos that remind you who bought your soul.**The bad and the ugly:-My first thought when I handled it was, ""a little chintzy, eh?"" It does give off the impression for a little while, primarily because of the battery cover. They used a plastic, snap-on/ pry-off cover whose snaps are easily bent out of shape, but did not break and easily bent back. The rest of the construction, especially the hinge, seems to be very solid now that I have used it extensively.-The 5MP camera takes remarkable photos and videos, unless you want to use the flash, which is too close to the lens and whites out a third of the image. Thinking about this more, I decided Nokia has used a very similar camera since September of 2006 when the first n95 debuted and such a quirk is unacceptable in something that has been around the technology world for so long.-The battery life is terrible. With normal use, it will most likely get 24-36 hours.-Reception is bad. The internal antenna does not pickup signal where my Blackberry does and my Samsung smartphone (4 years ago) before it did, to include my apartment in Boston (not exactly East Reeve, Wisconsin).-The FM transmitter is hardly worth having. After trying numerous stations I know to be unused in my area, the reception in my newer Audi with rear-mounted antenna was terrible unless I held the phone out the sunroof. I assume if you have a hood mounted antenna, it would be a little better (does anyone know?). UPDATE (4 July) - In two different cars with front mounted antennas and my home stereo the FM transmitter has still proved worthless. You can hear the music, but it comes through with more static than its worth.-The resistive touchscreen is outdated and somewhat unresponsive. Resistive touchscreens are great if you wear gloves, and if they are huge, but that doesn't happen on a mobile phone. Resistive touchscreens use a grid-like system to figure out where they've been touched, as they have invisible lines that make a grid across the screen. When the selected area is touched, the corresponding up/down and left/right lines are pushed against sensors on the screen's edge and send the information to the processor. Capacitive screens measure minute differences in its electric field cause by the conductive human body and are generally much more accurate.-The inertia scrolling is not as one would expect, probably because of the aforementioned screen. It does not matter how fast the screen is flicked, the information displayed travels the same measly distance and stops rather quickly no matter what, if it works at all. Navigating web pages is probably the only reason I would use the provided D-Pad just because the scrolling with the touchscreen is so terrible. UPDATE (4 July) - The inertia scrolling is not as terrible as I first said, but does vary with applications and takes some getting used to.-The accelerometer, which detects the direction the phone is tilted, is often incorrect and the phone is very slow to change the screen's display between portrait and landscape.-Oftentimes, the phone must be unlocked 2 or 3 times to get the LCD's backlight to turn on. This may be a software or a hardware malfunction, I do not know.-The talk and end button are not raised but should be, especially because the phone does not acknowledge them having been pressed for a second after. Plus, real buttons are always preferred.**Then there's the software:-The user interface is not so good. Every application has an options menu, but after the application has been customized, you probably will not find much need for any of the other options except exit, which is buried at the bottom of the menu and needs to be scrolled to.-The phone screen is inefficiently laid out. On the screen there is a ""Call"" and ""End"" button, both of which are physical keys on the phone itself, as well as a ""Contacts"" button which can be found on the previous screen. I would rather just see bigger numbers. Also, the phone is setup to display two lines of numbers and forces a single number from the area code on on the second line when I would rather like to see bigger number buttons and ALL US numbers on a single line.-The homescreen widgets do not update as freely as one might like, the AccuWeather is rarely connected and my Hotmail account will ONLY refresh manually, even with full service. The FaceBook app is good.-The homescreen has a button on it to change the sound profile, but tapping the power button brings up the same menu - Nokia should just get rid of the redundancy and dedicate the space to, well, uhhh, anything else.-No QWERTY keyboard option on the touchscreen.-Being able to run multiple apps is great, but switching between them shouldn't mean a fight with the options menu, there should be an external button to switch between them. UPDATE (4 July) - After further messing around, I found one can hold down the Main Menu button, the silver button to the left of the flat Talk / End buttons, for two seconds to bring up a menu with all open apps.-The homescreen has an option to compose a new message, but not one to read old messages. The button should be dedicated to going into the messenger application instead.-Half of the menus require a double touch while the other half require a single touch.-Plus a dozen smaller ""Oh, that's silly"" features not worth mentioning.-My phone has needed to be reset because one or more different things were not working correctly at least once a day, though it has never frozen completely. Once, strangely, the touchscreen would highlight the selected app/item, but fail to execute the command completely.--UPDATE (4 July)-One can hold down the Talk flat key for two seconds to activate voice commands which can do anything from call a contact to open an app. This is very slow and often incorrect and cannot be customized to one's voice. Once activated, there is a bar that runs for about six seconds, far longer than any command would take to say, and then takes a little while to process, before bringing back a series of possible matches. If you don't say anything else, it will automatically select the first option after another short duration. I could navigate manually to almost anywhere twice before the voice command finds the desired function, if it finds it at all. On the upside, users can customize what they want to say to the voice commands by typing (not speaking) the desired input to find some combination the phone can more easily recognize, though this is tedious and annoying.-When paused and exited from, the music play can remain on the homescreen with the Launch, Previous, Play, and Next options available.-The native video player has a very limited number of playable file types and I have not found a third party video player that works for the n97 yet.--END UPDATE (4 July)--UPDATE (23 July)I might be getting nit-picky with these software anomalies, forgive me, but I expect more from a $700 phone.The battery life, with average use, averages 48 hours now. I think eliminating the default AccuWeather widget from the homescreen helped out as it was constantly updating and crashing (and never that accurate).The new software update has been out for almost three weeks. It is an improvement and has fixed the backlight problem, amongst others, though not compeltely. Oftentimes, there is still a lengthy delay between unlocking the phone and the backlight turning on (2-4 seconds). Additionally, closing the screen will occasionally exit whatever program is running at the time. I notice this most frequently with the built in web browser and Nokia Sports Tracker. The GPS reception can be quick as lightning sometimes, but others it will not find a signal for an eternity.Compared to Opera Mini, the standard web browser is slow. Unfortunately, Opera Mini is quirky when dealing with the touchscreen. When it works, the SportsTracker is an excellent program, though Nokia has taken the n97 / 5800 version off their web page and it must be found through a third party.When the contacts menu is used to find someone to call or message, a new app is opened to perform the calling or messaging, thus when a second call or message is attempted to be made by navigating through contacts, the contacts menu opens as it was left with the last person dialed still highlighted on the screen.The symbol button is downright annoying. It accesses a list of symbols, most of which are already on the keyboard as secondary or tertiary options, and is located right next to the space bar and is hit frequently on accident. I would rather just see a bigger space bar than a useless key (at least I have never used it).--END UPDATE (23 July)--UPDATE (06 OCTOBER)I've gotten used to a lot of the quirks, though I'm still not entirely happy with them. The single most annoying feature is the inconsistency when turning the screen on - half of the time a message appears saying the key lock must be turned off when that is the only key I've pressed. It takes 3-5 seconds to go away, crippling anyone's intimate desire to use their ridiculously expensive phone on command.The phone's battery life seems to be much longer in Europe. I can go on a three day weekend, using the GPS, phone, and music features in moderation, without a charge. Maybe the European system is more efficient?--END UPDATE (06 OCTOBER)Overall, it is a good phone, but certainly not worth the money. I recommend you wait for the first (SECOND) major software update to be released and reviewed before purchasing.","June 28, 2009",
mobile phone,"Cute phone Nokia, now quit messing around.",G. O.,R2HURFIEMTSWFL,3,"I absolutely hate touch screens, yet I bought this phone.Why?This is a question for Nokia: if other people hate touch screens like I do--and they do--why do you think they'd buy the N97 with its inferior resistive touch screen over the iPhone's superior capacitive screen?Here's the reason: FULL QWERTY KEYBOARD.So when you make a phone with a ""full qwerty keyboard,"" and then you omit a dedicated row of numbers, it's not really a full qwerty keyboard now, is it? I come from a long line of QWERTY Nokia phones such as the 6820/6822, E70 and the Nokia E90 before this. The E90 has a full keyboard, complete with ctrl key so you can do seemingly simple things like copy (ctrl+c) and paste (ctrl+v). With my Nokia E90, typing was a breeze. You could even skip between words in sentences while typing text messages by holding ctrl and pressing left or right like you can in Windows (or even highlighting those words by pressing ""shift"").So imagine my disappointment when it took me a full minute of hunting through menus to forward a contact's phone number to someone via text message. Short of looking up the number, writing it down on a piece of paper, then typing it back, there's no other way to do this. What was a simple task on E90 and E70 (simply click options on the contact and it takes you to a sub-menu where you can copy the phone number into your clipboard), is an unwieldy chore on the N97. Here's how to copy a phone number to your clipboard: Contacts->Click on the contact->Options->Edit->Click on the phone number->Options->Editing Options->Copy->Start->Drag your finger across the number->Click Done. Absurd! And Lord knows how to paste it once you have it on your clipboard (you can only paste in apps that support the ""Editing Options"" submenu, so forget about pasting information in forms and menus on the phone for a quick lookup). I've scoured the Internet and there's simply no way to do this.Nokia has literally reduced functionality on this phone.Also, I can't stress enough how annoying it is to have to shift to type numbers, and to have to shift to type a comma. Are you kidding me? Commas are (or should be) the most used punctuation, up there with the period. Nokia's choice to make you shift to get a comma is dumbfounding.About the apps:-----------------Browser: the browser is frustratingly stupid. In older Nokia phones, you could simply type shortcuts while browsing 1 = enter URL, 2 = search, 3 = reload, 5 = switch between windows, etc. They removed this functionality from the browser. Why?! It's so annoying I could punch a vase. Why did you remove functionality that you had before, Nokia? Why? Nice one.-Facebook widget is okay; mostly sizzle, little steak. The presentation is nice, and it updates pertinent information, but you can only scroll through 20 or so entries in the live feed. There's no way to go trawling through a day or two of updates like you can by simply pointing your browser to the mobile version of Facebook.-Amazon app: throw it away. It's little more than a mobile front page that literally takes you to browsing on Amazon's mobile site.-AP News: does what it's supposed to. Video quality was good, news is what you'd expect from AP. Fairly functional app.-Guitar Rock Tour (like Guitar Hero): boring and unresponsive on the touch screen.. you have to tap too hard to register a click, so it slows the gameplay down and is exhausting to play.-AccuWeather: fairly accurate weather forecasts, though typing ""weather [zip]"" in Google seems to give more accurate results (AccuWeather seems to return results for the city you're in, but in a large coastal city like Los Angeles for example, a few miles can make a big difference).Usability:-----------There's a volume control button on the side that pivots up or down, and it only seems to work on calls. Since the buttons are there anyway, why not put them to use by allowing users to scroll up or down through menu items or web pages? Dragging around on the touch screen is frustratingly inaccurate and a chore.-There's a nice lock button on the side of the phone that seems fairly responsive (you can lock/unlock with a flick of your thumb). It did occasionally leave the screen black when I unlocked. I've updated to the latest firmware and haven't noticed the issue since, but it's disconcerting when it happens.-Exiting applications is TORTURE. In other Nokia phones, it's fairly easy to exit (just click the menu item, press up and it takes you to the bottom of the menu to exit). Or simply press the red ""hang up"" button and it will exit most apps. Not here. Pressing the red button does nothing (it only takes you to the home page). So before you know it, you have 20 different apps running in the background, all hogging up memory.-When you enter a sub-menu like the one for choosing symbols by pressing the ""Sym"" button on the keyboard, it's impossible to exit this menu. You have to choose a symbol, even if it's one you don't want, and then erase the symbol you chose. This underscores how poorly thought out the usability is.-Typing while in touch screen mode requires you to use a 10-key pad like on a traditional cell phone, and doesn't allow you to type using a full on-screen keyboard. This is so incredibly stupid that I almost vomited.Anyway, the phone has some pluses, such as the 5 MP camera, good 3G support, good storage, fairly quick, etc, but I won't go into the positives because there are a lot of other reviews on here that do. I've found that the negative reviews are always the most helpful on Amazon, even when an item has thousands of reviews (the negatives always point out stuff that I would also find annoying), so I hope that's also the case with this review.As I write this, I look at my pretty new N97 sitting next to my clunky old E90. The E90 is a beast of a phone, and yet, it did what it was supposed to do, and didn't make you jump through hoops to do it. I'll probably go back to the E90 and its dated apps, even if I have to use the terrible EDGE network for Internet. What I lose in transfer speed will be made up for in typing speed.------------------------------------------------------------------------Update: 11/30/2009I've now used this device for a few months, and have a few more insights and grievances:1. There is very little thought put into the alarm clock function. This is something basic I use all the time--instead of a real alarm clock in fact, so it's important for it to work well. When you set an alarm, the default setting is to create a permanent alarm that would repeat in 24 hours. Most people use alarms for quick reminders, such as when you park at a meter, or to take something out of the oven. So it's super annoying to have to go through and click ""do not repeat"" through a sub menu 5 times per day. Here's what really annoys me: even Nokia doesn't believe it should repeat 24-hours by default, because when you set an alarm for an event in your calendar, the default is to NOT repeat. Why the inconsistency Nokia?2. The slider button to unlock the phone is STILL GARBAGE. I thought it was a good idea, but it works correctly only 2/3rds of the time, even after numerous firmware updates (I always keep up to date). The slider leaves the screen lit every now and then, even when the phone is locked. Sometimes it does nothing (it vibrates but screen stays dark). Sometimes it's laggy so when you unlock it, it does nothing, then you do it again and it quickly unlocks and locks. Stupid. Get it together, Nokia.3. When you're on a phone call and you have to access any applications (such as your contact list to give someone a number), it's hard to get back to your dialer quickly (so you can switch to loudspeaker or switch calls). You have to hold down the button in the lower corner for 2 seconds, then flip through your open applications to your dialer. Stupid. Why does everything take so long to do on this phone?4. Speaking of, the entire phone is TOO SLOW. Basic functions like flipping from portrait to landscape, or pulling up your contact list, or going from locked to unlocked when you answer a phone call are almost always laggy (even with no running applications).5. Browser still has no keyboard shortcuts.6. Copy function is slightly improved (you can drag your finger across text in a text message and a ""Copy"" button will come up), but pasting is still IMPOSSIBLE unless the application specifically allows you to paste. So if you get a text message with an address in it, and you copy the text message into your clipboard buffer, you can't paste it into another application like say, Google Maps. You know, THE ENTIRE POINT OF COPYING AND PASTING ADDRESSES. UGH.7. The proximity detector doesn't work half the time. I'm so tired of the phone going to mute or to some random application because it was held up to my head while the phone's screen was active, so it thinks I'm pressing buttons with my face. Stupid.8. I hate this phone. The only reason I'm still using it is because of a few opensource apps that only exist on it, and it supports the US 3.5G networks, which the old E90 doesn't.I miss my E90.------------------------------------------------------------------------Update: 9/8/2010I absolutely hate this phone. I hate it.I've upgraded the firmware 3-4 times, I lost count. Nothing seems to help. The device lock still doesn't work. Sometimes it locks the screen (if you wait 3 seconds after a call), and sometimes if you don't wait long enough after exiting an app, it locks half the screen (most of it is dark but parts of the UI are still lit). Sometimes it doesn't do anything.I'm rebooting this phone 3-4 times per week due to lock ups. I tried to update Ovi Maps, but it still tries to download to the C: drive despite setting my download drive to E:, and it runs out of disk space. There's nothing more I can remove or delete on C: to run this update. I'm so tired of Nokia. I'm not the only one... the people who used to run Symbian Guru shut down the site recently. This is a big deal. There are no bigger advocates of your product than loyalists who run sites like Symbian Guru. To quote them:""To Nokia, you guys are losing. Hard. Wake the hell up. Doing the same thing repeatedly while expecting different results is the definition of insanity. I've been a huge Nokia fan since my 2nd cellphone, and I just can't do it any longer. You guys aren't competing like you once were, and everyone but you seems to see that. You used to build the world's best smartphones, the world's best cameras, the world's best GPS units - you've lost pretty much all of that, and with nothing to show for it. You unveiled your Ovi vision over 2 years ago - I was there. Today, it's still a complete mess. I have to log in every single time I visit the site - regardless of how many times I check the `remember me' box. I spent 6 months (and about 3 hours at Nokia World 2009) trying to find someone to help me with Ovi Contacts on the web - no one knew who to point me to. You spent millions of dollars purchasing your Ovi pieces - Ovi Files, Ovi Share, and a host of other little companies - are you proud of what you `built' with them? Most of your own employees (that I've talked to) don't even use them, so why should I?""I hate almost everything about this phone. If it didn't support the faster 3G network (faster than other Nokia phones), and migration wasn't such a chore, I'd have ditched it long ago. Alas, there are no great Qwerty phones with all the features I'm looking for, except maybe the new Droid phones coming out. I think that's what I'm going to move on to. Nokia's inability to satisfy their core user base with high quality, high up-time units has lost me as a customer. Nothing short of a full refund and an apology would get me back to Nokia's arms again.","July 2, 2009",

So whats the point of so much space, when it cant be used for proper management.Email software - doesnt support HTML; cant set unique notification tones for different email account, so when a new mail arrives and a person has 5 email acc setup, they will have to browse through all 5 Inboxes to see which one has the new emailBrowser - satisfactory;Battery - satisfactory; lasts more than a day with average usage.Google Apps/Facebook/Youtube - not satisfactory at all; facebook crashes all the time(I have finally uninstalled it), GMail app doesnt notify of new mails like it does on Blackberry; Google Maps has great interface, but I loose connection all the time when I am out of my wifi range.Multi-tasking - good feature and works well as long as all phone memory is not used up!Am waiting to download the v2.0 firmware upgrade that is being so much talked about. Hopefully it will fix the software issues.","November 2, 2009",
mobile phone,I hope more...,C. Degani,RV5W45GPJ5DTU,3,"Because it was a top N Series and most expensive cellphone at Nokia during a couple months, I expected more to this investment. A lot of bugs - some solving with 2.0 Firmware, some not - like bad first Facebook app (now, better). The problem with landing page (the page of gadgets) continues I think because this stout cellphone needs a Intel processador - may be - like Duo Core for Nokia :). I really believe if this could possible, this Nokia N97 might be better than seems...The camera looks like ok, but always when I take a picture with flash, the weard fog appears in the corner below, left side...Istead of I like the qwerty keyboard it's ok and the apps available could be better in Ovi portal.","January 11, 2010",

mobile phone,Nokia N97 experiment gone bad...,O. Dee,R2C4LRO68Y89SD,3,"I was looking to switch from my Blackberry to another Smart phone that I thought could handle my daily requirements (I'm what you would call a power user). I paid almost $600.00 for the phone and consequently had high expectations. I had the phone for one day and realized at the end of the day this definitely wasn't the phone for me. The software was very unstable and if you haven't used the Symbian Interface before, it is not as intuitive as other smart phones. I'm not exagerrating when I say the phone for whatever reason froze up while being used at least 3 times an hour. I would have to remove the battery and put it back in to get the phone working again and this was the ultimate deal breaker. The fact that I couldn't browse the internet or perform basic functions on such an expensive smartphone convinced me to return the phone the very same day. Amazon.com offered spectacular customer service and I was immediately given a refund. Hope other buyers have a better experience than I did but for me, I'm back to my Blackberry Bold 9000 and waiting for the Blackberry Bold 9700 to go on sale at Amazon.com...","November 12, 2009",

mobile phone,"Nokia, N, 97.",T for Tony,R1KY8WGDWX35JX,3,"I actually DON'T own a N97 myself. But nearly everyone around me had one. Everyone had different comments on the N97, just like people here had different words about this phone. There is a situation: I can rarely see any insight reviews... Most typical example: lazybones, you don't just compare iphone to N97, OK?? I've been a s60 and Nokia user for years and years until I lost my N82 a year ago. By that time, iPhone already spread out in the world. Needless to purchase a new phone, my dad had a spare iPhone, which substitutes my N82. And you know what, I found it's poisonous, because it's completely built for lazybones, and when people start becoming lazy, they never wanna change back. It's a easy thing to use iPhone, for sure, install things by touching once, but it never made me feel like a real owner and user of the phone like I did when I was with s60 in N82... Maybe I seem to have no points on what I'm saying, but I had this statement: if you are a fan of iPhone, then you would never start liking symbian, and most unlikely Nokia...Well since I did not have a N97, I don't deserve to RATE this stuff...instead, i just typed what I wanted to comment on all those pointlessly negative reviews...

mobile phone,Incredible potential. Substandard execution.,"Kevin Nicholls ""jaded, aging hipster""",R1T7KKC62GZ5JZ,3,"I pre-ordered my N900 the moment I found out about it, back in September. And I patiently waited, and waited, while watching every demo, preview, and review I could find. With each passing day, I knew I was closer to mobile bliss. And one day, my N900 arrived.Sadly, it didn't really deliver.Having (briefly) owned an N97, I was incredibly disappointed to discover that Nokia has tried their hardest to port elements of Symbian phones to the Maemo platform. Once you're past the (admittedly awesome) desktop effects, the N900 feels disturbingly similar to the N97 in terms of use.""Mail Not Responding. Quit?""If you use e-mail, you're going to see this message. Using the included Mail application for Exchange and an IMAP account is painful, to say the least. If you're coming from another Symbian phone, you'll discover that the Mail application is every bit as slow and constrained as your old phone, but does a (marginally) better job of rendering HTML messages. If you're coming from something like an iPhone or BlackBerry, forget about it. Having an iPhone 3G and BlackBerry Bold as well, the messaging on the N900 is infuriating.The screen is gorgeous, in terms of resolution. It's trash in terms of accuracy, if you aren't using the included stylus. I don't have huge fingers, and yet, nearly every tap is either interpreted wrong, or not registered at all. Using kinetic scrolling will inevitably open something you didn't intend to open, or do nothing at all. You'll find yourself asking ""Did I tap once or twice?"".Web browsing? Brilliant. Seriously. The included web browser is every bit as good as everyone says. Pages render properly, Flash works, zooming in and out is excellent. If you just wanted a handheld web browser and nothing else, I'd recommend this ten times out of ten.""But it runs Linux! Linux, Linux, Linux!""Sure. I consider myself to be fairly platform agnostic when it comes to phones, and frankly, the ""open"" nature of Maemo is something of a red herring. Yes, getting applications on the N900 that aren't blessed by Nokia is relatively easy. Yes, you can compile OpenOffice to work on the N900. The question really is: ""Will you?"". In a lot of ways, I can see how the N900 would be an excellent tool if I was a Unix / Linux admin who wanted the flexibility to work anywhere without a laptop or netbook. And, there's a certain geek credibility that comes with doing something for the sake of doing it, especially when you have such a portable platform. The N900 is great for those things. And keep in mind, that's largely the audience that Nokia is targeting with the N900.For well over a decade, Nokia's been known for rock-solid performance on signal and voice quality. With the N900, again, they've come short. 3G call quality is decent. If you're outside of a 3G area (which is likely, if you use this with T-Mobile, and a certainty if you're on AT&T;), the N900 has a very difficult time maintaining a decent GPRS/EDGE signal, and dropped calls are frequent. Admittedly, the phone functionality is something of an afterthought from Nokia on this specific model -- but it really shows.As for carrying it around, the N900 isn't quite the ""brick"" some have claimed it to be. It's definitely substantial, compared to other phones available, though not unreasonable to carry in a pocket. The multimedia functionality is above average, capable of playing just about every type of music and movie format I could throw at it. The camera, while decent, is not substantially better than what you'd find in most midrange to high-end phones in terms of picture quality.Overall, the N900 is a huge series of tradeoffs. For many ""it doesn't do..."" there are workarounds, or will be workarounds, or might be workarounds. And that's really the crux of my rating. The hardware, in and of itself, is not very special for a phone that costs this much. And the shortcomings may well be addressed, but you have to question how much time and effort you're willing to put in to this device just to bring it at par with similarly priced alternatives. At the same time, there's a lot of wishful thinking, if you aren't prepared to roll up your sleeves and do some development work. ""Maybe Nokia will address this in a firmware update..."" or ""Maybe someone will write a script or program that does this..."" will be your mantras if you don't do the work yourself.***January 2010 Update***I'm now on my third N900 -- the previous two were defective.I had considered completely re-writing this review, but too many aspects continue to hold true.What's different:The newer N900 is much more stable, and doesn't crash nearly as often as I had described previously. That's not to say that it doesn't crash, but with the newer hardware and firmware, it no longer crashes if you look at it the wrong way.The developer community is reasonably active on the Maemo platform, and it didn't take very long for some great apps to come out. Installing them doesn't hold a candle to what you'd find on an Android phone or iPhone, but if you're familiar with CVS/SVN or can follow simple instructions, getting some repositories going is a snap, as is finding interesting software. I've been particularly happy with seeing open source projects like Pidgin and Keepass ported over so fast.What's the same:Mail is still pretty terrible, especially if you have a large inbox. Getting the number of messages down will help to make the application more responsive, however, it still is a far cry from what you'd see in competing smartphones on every major platform. It also inexplicably stops updating (yes, fanboys, even when it's not set for off-peak hours), and the ""Last Updated"" timestamp rarely correlates to reality.The OS still needs refinement. Case in point: It simply doesn't do a good job of telling you that it's busy. Sure, nobody wants to build an hourglass (or spinning beachball) in to their OS, but there are times when the OS is just bogged down when you're positive the screen isn't registering taps.All things being equal, I'm still going to hold to my original conclusion that the N900 isn't for the general consumer looking to out iPhone the iPhone. But for someone not afraid of rolling up their sleeves, the N900 can be an amazing device for Unix aficionados and hard-core gadget geeks.Oh... and a quick tip: This car charger works perfectly with the N900, and is dirt cheap: Motorola P513 Vehicle Power Adapter MicroUSB Rapid Rate Charger","December 3, 2009",
mobile phone,Good but not there yet froze a lot returned & got a nexus one,PGram,RWNQKZ0UNAI6H,3,Ok here we go. The keyboard was small not wide enough so it had me wanting my G1 badly.

Maemo store not even open yet. Basically I got this because of flash but Nexus One I just got has flash 10[...] it will be added later this month. This phone froze on me so much I had to return it. Gave me so much problems it was very annoying. Goodbye N900 good try but needs so much help. Camera is great got to give it that. Loving the nexus one right now. N900 too buggy for me. slows down when you have certain apps running. 3 stars for effort. Had to take out the battery a lot.

mobile phone,"Lots of promise, but will it be fulfilled?","tonygeno ""tonygeno""",R1C5WCLBHRAAOX,3,"I received the N900 today and have been playing with it for several hours. I find the form factor to be fine and like the heft. If feels solid in your hand. Others have done a good job of discussing the pros and cons of this device: it's got a great web browser, it's easy to zoom and enjoy the full web, the mail, calendar and contact apps work well together and the skype integration with the dialer is great. I haven't got into the media player or maps just yet and I'm not sure it will be around long enough for me to do so.There is one thing, in fact, that is really, really bad. I am running a Zimbra Server at work. With all my other phones I use activesync to update mail, contacts and calendars. I've successfully synced with an iPhone, Nexus One (everything but calendar), and the Droid. With the N900 however, exchange integration is very weird. Contacts and calendars work great, but the majority of the mail comes in blank. The header is there but there's no body to the messages and the from field says ""no recipient"". I did a search on the Maemo forums and others have reported the same behavior (some running Exchange server 2003 and 2007) so it doesn't appear to be strictly a Zimbra issue. I tried setting it up using IMAP which at least allowed me to read the whole message, but it was just too slow and I really have become accustomed to activesync.This phone was supposed to replace my jailbroken and unlocked iPhone as my primary business phone. I moved it to T-Mobile as I was dropping far too many calls on the ""more bars in more places just not my places network"". As it stands now, it won't. Unless I (or someone) can figure out a way to make the activesync work reliably, the phone will have to go back.Finally, there's been a bunch of discussion on whether Maemo will continue to be supported by Nokia. Just last week they announced an alliance with Intel and are combining the Maemo and Moblin Linux distros. They've named the new project Meego. So it appears that this may be the opening (and swan) song for Maemo. MeeGo now...","February 25, 2010",

Friendly experience of web browsing.Cons:The camera regularlly says something like 'unexpected error' (sorry guys I forget the exact words) which makes you unable to take any pictures unless you restart it. The front camera quality is a disaster.Other thoughts: By the way I tried i-touch which maybe more or less like the experience of iphone. To be honest, I think nokia did better job at making touch screen.Overall: You should buy it considering it's less than $600 and UNLOCKED!Argument:Some people may think if the product available in US does not neccessary have to include Chinese input.

I heard someone saying 'well, it's US, English is native language'. I have to say 'man,even English is not native language in China, we still like to have English input in our every device'. does that make sense? Please forgive me if this argument offense someone.","December 23, 2009",

I personally didn't find it a match for me because of the compact size of the device and I prefer the querery keyboard (which it provides) but with limited space. My fingers are pretty big so it wasn't a good fit for me. Also I found out that because I am in the US I would not be able to set up my e mail on the cellular side but wireless works great.

Go elsewhere.After owning one since they were released in December, 2009, the following still are ""show-stoppers"" for me to recommend to my non-nerd friends:* Apps are basically only from open-source hackers. You're not going to find the depth of what is available on the iPhone or and Android phone. OVI Store is basically devoid of N900 apps of any value.* No MMS without a 3rd-party app (and then not integrated with SMS)* No iSync without a 3rd-party app* USB charging won't work from most ""dumb"" chargers, such as lighter-to-USB or batteries* No distinctive ringtones* No voice dialing* GPS lock takes several minutes, if at all* Maps application is total junk, even if GPS locks* Will not sync with older versions of Exchange Server* Contacts with both a name and a company can't easily be searched on company* Resistive touchscreen requires a stylus for most interactions and is much harder to use than the iPhone or Andriod phones* Battery life relatively poor (I have to charge during the day if I use the browser)* FM transmitter (for car radio) close to uselessOn the upside, the QWERTY keyboard is an essential for me, the camera is good, the browser is functional, and it has Flash (thought not Flash 10).While PR1.2 update has improved some usability in many areas, the OS appears to be a dead end for Nokia, as their current releases are going with the Symbian line again.","June 14, 2010",
mobile phone,Meet expectations but...,Cristina,R22TSXWDNOTUS3,3,"I would like to state that I received my order promptly and in good condition. It is evident that Thriftycomputer makes a good effort to deliver in both price and logistics.However, there are issues that I would like to discuss and they definitely prevent me from giving this retailer 5 stars.I bought a Nokia N900 phone from this page:http://www.amazon.com/dp/B002OB49SW/ref=pe_175190_21431760_3p_M3T1_ST1_dp_1I chose Thriftycomputer because it offered the best price for the handset. The problem is that I based my purchase on what it said in the ""Technical details"" section. Quoting:What's in the Box: handset, battery, travel charger, stereo headset (WH-205), video out cable (CA-75U), cleaning cloth, operating instructionsThe package I got was insted a no-frills package: charger, handset, and battery. That's it. No trace of the USB cable, TV out cable, headphones, etc. Worse, the battery was not a genuine Nokia BL-5J and that fact showed in the extremely poor battery life. The package came with a manual that was for a nondescript Nokia featurephone. The whole package, in fact, was so cheap that I thought the phone was a counterfeit. Thankfully it was legitimate.Later I saw Thriftycomputer's website and I saw the same item. This time it had an accurate description of what was included. But the fact is, the Amazon.com page said otherwise.Maybe another person would have felt scammed by this. But I didn't. I wanted to buy a N900 because I had one and I lost it last April. And I had the good sense of storing all the accesories, as well as a spare Nokia battery. To be fair, the handset was all what I needed and thus the purchase did the job.That's why I'm not giving 5 stars to this purchase. Thanks.","March 4, 2013",

mobile phone,Great for geeks,omissis,R3PZILJ9Y6CKKE,3,"I bought this mobile phone because of its gorgeous geekness, but after one month of use I' ve got to say it has some annoying problems.First of all, the battery: I had to disable use of 3g network, wifi, bluetooth and gps in order to get a barely decent battery life(1.5 days). I know it's not just about this phone, but still it's annoying being unable to use 3g internet for more than 1 hour because then you run out of charge for the whole day.Second thing, some choices in the design of the case are disputable, the screen's on/off switch is on the bottom of the phone implying the use of two hands to activate/deactivate it, which is quite annoying. It can be mediated by setting the on/off button properly, but it' s not the best option.Another problem is the position of the usb(or whatever it is) port: when you have to write something, you constantly have the wire in between of your left hand's fingers, which is annoying again.Also the screen is not the best one on the market and while it's decent, iPhone's or HTC HD2 are on a higher level.Last thing, the interface: although the phone has a builtin gyroscope, it' s never used except for the gallery application. As result, this phone can be properly used only on its widescreen orientation, which is great for texting and instant messaging, but it sucks hard when you' ve got to look for a contact and call him.My final consideration is that this phone is worth buying if you're not an ""intensive caller"", because after a while it' ll drive you a bit mad with its horizontal configuration(the only moment in which the interface is vertical is when you close it right before the phone call).It doesn' t have only cons though: the interface is original and very nice to see and use, you just have to take some time to get used to it.The keyboard is probably my favourite part, it' s freaking comfortable, way better than on-screen ones, it made me almost forget I was not using a laptop to chat.The other nice thing is the operating system: you' ve got a full-featured linux distribution running on it, therefore you've got access to some of the most well-known software: firefox, xchat, pidgin and so on; the default browser is by far the best one I've ever tried on a mobile device(also thanks to the keyboard).An impression I had is that sometimes the whole system suffers a bit because of the cpu speed, which should be ~600mhz, but it's acceptable, the only thing is that it's not as fluid as an iphone.To sum up everything, I think this is a good phone for a geek(also because of nice QT development environment), but I wouldn't recommend it to the average user.","June 27, 2010",
mobile phone,"It's a good phone, but did not make me ""very"" happy","Alex V. ""Alex""",RH5UR1TQS1RT0,3,"Ok, so many detailed and well writen reviews are here so what I'm going to do is tell you my personal experience with this phone that I've been using for a month and a half now.When I first got the phone, I had a very HARD time with it restarting by itself when using the Internet or when using more than 2 applications at a time. Within a Nokia forum I found out that it was because of the firmware that the phone came with (not totally tested I guess) and that was why I almost threw it to the wall more than one time, as I was sick of having a brand new phone that restarted itself every time I used it.Thanks to that forum, I found a way to go around and manually fix the problem and it was really solved. Then came the firmware update and finally the phone was working fine using Nokia factory configurations (not a manual fix).About the good stuff on this phone: it was made to work as a little computer on your hands, which is great since it has several applications (not so many) to work with and customize it. The Internet browsing it IS like you were seating on your on PC/laptop, if you go to youtube, or facebook or amazon, etc, you will not enter the ""mobile"" sites but to the actual site.When making a call, I've had several volume issues, I've took the volume to the limit and if I'm in a noisy environment, I have a hard time hearing the other person. Even worse is the speaker phone, I really don't know why, since the stereo speakers sound great if you play music or videos, but not when using it for a call (lack of volume).The video quality is amazing, I actually connected my phone to my LCD TV and watched a couple of widescreen movies. The music player is nice too, I haven't used playlists but the phone itself categorize the music by 4 categories that are very useful, most of all the ""never played"" category.The keyboard, well, it is nice, but as many others had said, you have to get used to the space bar on the right side, not in the middle. The keyboard also may get slided accidentally when handling the phone to take a photo. About the camera, it works pretty cool to, it has several settings that are useful. I can't comment more on this since I did not buy the phone because of the camera, I don't really ""use"" it like some others. In addtion, I haven't found out how to copy and paste when browsing, since you cannot use the pencil to ""select"" text then copy and paste it elsewhere.About disk space, touchscreen usage and resolution, this is where this phone starts to be a competition to the iphone and so many other phones. 32GB is enough space to put my favorite music and movies, I can't say applications since there aren't so many apps for maemo yet. The touchscreen is beautiful, the 4 different workspaces make the phone very interesting, since you may customize one for business, one for fun/media, one for internet related stuff and another one for whatever you may like.Personally, I like to have custom ringtones for several contacts, but Im still unable to do this with this phone... :(Now, even that the phone is beautiful, fast and very useful, what I still don't like is the size, weight and grip of it. Don't take me wrong, I was not expecting a lightweight phone with all the features it has, BUT, this is way to heavy and bulky for me and that is one more reason for me to rate it 3 stars (IT IS OK).","January 23, 2010",

mobile phone,A Boiling Tar Pit with Skype Video Calls!,Noirist,R32VVWKICHW9MO,3,"The Nokia N900 has decent hardware but horrible buggy feature-incomplete software. Its operating system (Maemo5) has been abandoned by Nokia and the applications written for it are mostly written by hobbyists in python. Some are good, many are not, and some don't even install correctly. Getting basic features to work correctly -- like syncing the phone's calendar with Google calendar -- require countless hours of Internet searches and the trial-and-error installation of alpha-release hobbyist software. The phone ships with not one not two but THREE separate bookmarks to Nokia's OVI store/service, and guess what? None of them work! Nokia's own OVI store/service reject the N900 as an unsupported device. I own this phone's predecessor (the Nokia N810) and swore never to buy another Maemo device. It's simply not worth the hassle for people like me who want our mobile applications to work out of the box.In that boiling tar pit of application horror exists a brilliant and valuable gem - mobile Skype video calls. Yes, as of May 2010, you can make Skype video calls from the Nokia N900 with front-facing camera to any Skype client on any platform, either over WiFi or over T-Mobile 3G. As of this writing, this is the only phone in the world that can do that. For example, the iPhone 4 can only make video calls to other iPhone 4s and it can only do it over WiFi. The Evo 4G lacks a Skype client. And yes, it will take hours and hours of internet searches to figure out how to get Skype video calls to work on the N900. But work it does.So that leaves you, gentle reader, with a simple decision. In front of you, the boiling tar pit that is the Nokia N900 with Maemo5. Somewhere in that tar pit are the rare and valuable mobile Skype video calls over 3G. Are you willing to pay $450 to step into the tar pit and retrieve the treasure?","June 28, 2010",
mobile phone,a disappointment,Dan Lee,R19SRP522CG6ZS,3,"I really had high hopes for this phone, but ended up really disappointed with it. I've been a long time Nokia fan and this phone isn't the reason why I've loyal. The firmware needs much more work, and there simply isn't a large enough community to contribute and Nokia needs to do more to get it to the point where it can compete with the iPhone for any Android","July 11, 2011",
mobile phone,Not ready yet,"Amazon Customer ""Techno Geek""",RXLDIWF0W9CYF,3,"Waiting a week after having ordered it, I was excited to see how this phone would do its thing. Note that I have Nokia E63 and was very happy with its performance and was expecting N900 to blow it away. Unfortunately it was not so. The battery life was just awful. After using it for just couple hours the battery indicator showed halfway mark. I was told that I had to run couple cycles to create battery memory. I did not remember reading that for this phone. Other reviewers reported decent battery life and I will check to see if it improves or it may be defective. Note that the E63 initially did have poor battery life but after updating and upgrading the software for the N63, the battery life improved considerably so that I did not feel like I had to look for an electrical outlet.Email is just slow for the N900. I have Gmail account and it just works on Nokia E63. I searched for solutions on the N900 and so far have not found it. It is just inexcusable that basic things like email would perform so poorly compared to the slower cousin like Nokia E63.Map and GPS. The interface is just horrible. Not usable. No memory for previous trips; no Home feature that is expected on GPS (after finishing a trip, just click on HOME to go back home). It is Ovis Map version 1.0 and it does not have speech feature for directions. We had to go back using the Garmin GPS. That was sure disappointing.Contacts: This phone combined the email addresses, chat and IM nicks and Phone contacts into one book. I did not like it. I like to separate the phone contacts from chat and email lists. Maybe it is something to get used to. Right now, to make phone calls, I have to go to Contacts and then select a name to call. With Nokia E63 I was able to type couple letters on the main desktop and it would direct me to the Contact's list starting with those letters. It did not work that way on the N900. It could be solved with software or some kind of programming.Stylus. I was shocked to see the stylus on the phone. That brought me back memories of Palm Pilot back in the 90's and thus gave me a strong feeling that it was going backward and not forward. After using it for couple days, I do have to admit that using stylus is far better and easier than using fingers. Coupled that if you use fingers on the touch screen, it gets oily and dirty fast. The control is very accurate using stylus and it became second nature.Browsing the internet. Not too bad. Sometimes pages load slow but it is readable even with small print. I am nearsighted so it was not a problem seeing the small print. If you were farsighted and or have Presbyopia, it would present problem but you can easily make it larger by moving the volume button up to make screen larger or you can tap it couple times to make it larger. The challenge is with tapping that it sometimes works and sometimes it does not. My friend has the other unit and it does not enlarge when tapping. It seems like there is a way to turn it ON and OFF but I guess we have to read the manual.The Screen. This unit has the most awesome screen I have seen for small factor tablet / phone.They keyboard. Not too bad. I find myself with the thumbs hitting the bottom part of the screen frame. I wish that they could move the screen frame further away from the keyboard.3G Phone connection. Not bad. The WIFI connection works great though. I have downloaded the entire Don Quijote from Gutenberg site and it took seconds. There are not too many apps available for this phone and I wanted a Bible and so I downloaded several books from the Bible on the Gutenberg site and that fulfilled a need for now.My recommendation? If you are just a plain consumer who likes their product to work with no problems, I would NOT recommend this product YET. The iPhone is popular for a reason. I do not have one myself for the simple reason it is locked with ATT and that the batteries are not removable (easily at least).If you are a geek who are into programming and enjoy solving problems (believe me, there are problems with these phones!) this phone would be great for them. I went to Fry's Electronics couple days ago and the phone guy shared that they had 15 on stock and it was gone in a week.I do wish Nokia the best in producing a phone that works and specs sounded great for this phone but the reality is that it is not ready yet. That is disappointing.UPDATE:I reflashed the OS and it works so much better! The battery life became more reasonable. Email responded faster than before (but still slow).Before I used the phone I did update the software but apparently something was not right. I tried updating it but it said I had the most current software. I did check around and all I found were geeks' way to reload the camera OS by using some Linux command. A friend of mine was using Nokia's PC Suite and noticed that it had option to reload the OS and so I tried it. It did work!!********************************************************************May 3rd 2010 update:It has been three months since I had this phone and I am getting to love it!!.I had been loading apps (all free so far) like crazy and one amazing app is the Debian app that installs FULL OPEN OFFICE SUITE with word processor and full spreadsheet!! It also installed the full Firefox 3.1 browser called Iceweasel.I enjoyed taking pictures with Nokia N900. Of course my Canon EOS 5D Mark II takes far better pictures but if I do not have the Canon with me, because of weight consideration etc, then I will miss lots of shots as a result! So having a great camera in cell phone is always handy. Night time pictures are not the best, being quite grainy and all. Which did not surprise me.Firefox just introduced beta mobile version for this phone and it works quite well!! With full flash support and one is even able to save web pages as a PDF file. And also it rotates with the phone. And even though the print is tiny, it is amazingly readable, a testament to the high resolution screen. And also the new Firefox mobile for N900 is magnifiable using the volume control button which is very handy to make it easier to read. But so far I am not able to copy paste from Firefox mobile for N900. I am able to copy and paste text using the IceWeasel browser found in Debian file.About battery life, I am quite a power user and so I had to charge every day. Sometimes twice or three times a day if I am playing games like Angry Birds or the 3D game TuxRacer. Which really did not surprise me. I find it quite acceptable now. I learned to shut off the Bluetooth, WIFI to conserve energy and to lower screen brightness.Oh yes, this phone has Skype functionality built in and can use Skype networks to make phone calls. So you can make free international calls to you Skype friends. Or be in a Skype subscription program and you may have unlimited international calling. Skype was quite easy to set up with this unit. And yes you can text you Skype friends too, using the Conversation app which combined cell phone contacts, gmail contacts, aol contacts, Skype contacts and other contacts into one list. It took a while to get used to it (I was used to different contacts for different usage) but having one list actually makes sense now...I am still waiting for the Maemo upgrade. It is now available in the new models announced in Hong Kong. Hopefully it will fix the email problems. Still SLOW!! Reportedly it fixes several issues with Maemo browser. If they fix that, it probably will be the best browser hands down for any smartphone.","March 16, 2010",
mobile phone,N900: Think of it as a mini computer that can make phone calls on the side,Kingmonkey,RTC0HWBC3RHMZ,3,"Overall nice design, style and quality materials were used.Physically, I wish the USB slot had a snap on cover like my Nokia C6 to prevent dust from getting in, nice feature to have but I guess Nokia saved some money by not including this ""bell and whistle"" feature. Physically the top row of the keyboard is better spaced than the Nokia C6 (see my C6 review under my ID: Kingmonkey), which is cramped at the top so when you type your finger touches the top slider portion, but here for the N900 there is more room so typing using the top row of the keyboard is more roomier. Physically again there is a lot of chatter of the N900 being a ""brick"" or bulkier and bigger than most smart cell phones. I don't think so, I think the extra heft denotes quality, I would say about 25% more heft than C6 (the C6 is ""weighty"" too but so is my Blackberry Bold 9000). It's only about an extra .25"" thicker than the C6 and maybe .25"" wider than C6 from left to right, held vertically. The photos of the N900 (C6 too) make it seem like they are big phones, I don't think so, I can hold them in my palm just like my Blackberry Bold 9000 and my Bold is actually wider than the N900. I think the N900 is a good size and is NOT a brick or the size of a brick, again it's SLIMMER than my Blackberry Bold 9000 when you compare them side by side by width, although being slimmer it is thicker than the Bold 9000 by less than an half an inch. Bottom line I don't like big phones and I do not think the N900 is a big phone. It is a relatively heftier phone but dimension wise (lxw) it fits comfortably in your hand although it may weigh down a bit in your shirt pocket or pant pocket (I carry mine in its case and keep it in my bag for the most part).The software operating system is Maemo based. As such, compared to the C6 Symbian op system, it is a little more complicated to master/familiarize yourself with, not as intuitive as my C6. It is a sophisticated system, screen icons are sophisticated looking too. Image wise the N900 leaves the C6 Symbian graphics in the dust.As for the software side, this is where the N900 may leave some frustrated and where most of the complaints are compared to the physical aesthetics of the N900 (people mostly complain about the size and weight of the N900 but as I said above, it is surprisingly small when I first opened up the box). For my Google calendar I had the same issue as with the C6, You can use MS exchange and set up the Nokia calendar+contacts that way, but again it just populates the main calendar items (no info is populated for calendars you created such as bills, holiday calendars or whatever other Google calendars you customized your calendar with on your PC Google calendar account; it also populates all Gmail contacts which I don't want since I don't want everyone I email to be a my N900's personal ""contact"" list; I suppose there is an option to choose to populate contacts only, calendar only but I don't remember, pretty sure I saw something like that though. Anyway, deleted the calendar and contacts for the reasons stated once I tried using MS exchange to install Gmail, calendar, and contacts. Instead, like what I did for the C6, for the Google calendar I bookmarked the google mobile calendar and use this to access my calendar via the web on the N900. For contacts in the N900 phone book I enter them myself and personalize this way, linking a photo to each name if I want.Now as for linking Gmail,the details . . . what a hassle! (mind you I have an undergraduate AND graduate degree in economics, an MBA, work in finance (analytical work), and teach economics and statistics part time at a State University here in California and community college too so I have at least average intelligence and know my way around computers and all). Like I said above, I tried MS exchange option under settings and it did not work. I did also researched help forums online for ways people did it. Did not work for me after several attempts. I think I went to the email wizard set up and did it this way, after several attempts, wasted a few good hours, the whole afternoon pretty much troubleshooting how to link Gmail to my N900; finally got it to work, but it is slow in refreshing, every time you go to your inbox it refreshes and takes a few minutes. By the way, my C6 I decided to test email it, so I sent one out but it did not go out immediately, so I did another send mail and again I have 2 outgoing emails in my inbox for the C6, I noticed too that the inbox would not populate even though on my PC I see a new email (Gmail on my C6 was working earlier!); anyway decided to uninstall the gmail account on the Nokia C6 and reinstall, maybe there was a glitch, so when I tried to start fresh and install Gmail again on the C6 I can't get pass by the intial set up since when I click ""Start"" it would not go anywhere, I guess the network is down, will try again later. I tried at home and reinstalled gmail on the C6 and now can receive and send emails without the outbox holding the waiting to be sent email, it was almost instant...good. Anyway, back to the N900 . . .the next day the Google talk (preinstalled on the N900, did not have to use a 3rd party app to access Google Talk like I did on the C6, which I used ""Nimbuzz"") it was not connecting. I will need to troubleshoot why the Google Talk is not connecting on the N900 after I finish this review.In addition to the physical keyboard there is a virtual onscreen one, but you have to activate it first under Settings-->Text input and then check mark the box to enable it. Then when you type in the field entry box, for say, a text message, it pops up (the physical keyboard has to be closed for the virtual keyboard to show up)I am beginning to notice a theme with Nokia phones, C6 or N900, linking Gmail to it (email, calendar) is a pain and/or does not work well (Google this topic on the web using key words such as Linking Gmail to Nokia N900 and you'll see a lot of other people wasted a good day on the same thing--I started at 9am or so and it is now 4pm; skipped lunch too, and I just got Gmail set up and the desktop widgets all organized/customized with thoughts of returning the N900 during the frustration). Anyway for the N900 I got it set up and customized the home screens, for the home screen you have 4 screens, I customized with the following on each screen:Homescreen #1: Various ovi apps (since I need to quick access to download more apps when I have time)Homescreen #2: Various tools such as calculator, calendar, phone settings, ovi mapHomescreen #3: Various bookmarked webpages such as cnbc, yahoo, google calendar (this is how I access my Google calendar: via web), Gmail as a backup in case the email client on N900 is not behaving; web globe icon for web/internet accessHomescreen #4: contacts, people I call most (it's cool in that if there is a photo linked to the contact you see that photo), also a voicemail button,; also have am sms icon, email access icon, I need to find out how to add Google talk as an icon here for quick accessTo access each homescreen you just flick across the screen like you're flipping pages and the next screen shows left to right or right to left depending how you flick. By the way on web pages to magnify you move your finger in a circular motion clockwise and the opposite to make smaller again.Also the only way the screen will be in portrait mode (vertical) is on the phone use setting, otherwise, everything else you use the phone for, will be in landscape mode, which is disappointing, I'd wish the screen would flip to portrait and landscape for everything; if I remember correctly, my Nokia C6 flips back and forth from portrait to landscape for everything.Bottom line if you want an easy to use phone that is user friendly and intuitive to learn fairly fast (within 1-2 hours), 100% go with the Nokia C6 (which has voice assisted GPS guidance, and the N900 does not), I picked that up in an hour or two and got it all set up. The N900 is a ""sports car"" of a phone, a Ferrari that has transmission problems that is, takes more time to master the set up and screens, widgets and stuff. If you don't enjoy tinkering with gadgets (non techie type and just want a phone that works and easy to set up) the N900 is NOT for you. On the other hand, if you want to sacrifice some functionality/ease of use for looks, get the N900.","September 13, 2010",
mobile phone,It's a brick,Philip Skeete,R2Y76ZAUS2L4WI,3,"I nicknamed this phone ""the brick"", Nokia can't be serious. With such sexy smartphones on the market (nexusone, iphone 3gs, droid, palm pre) they cant really expect to sell this phone in any real volume, its just not gonna happen. This phone is in the same price range as the very sexy and capable nexusone.Here the upside (and why its not that great):- Browser support full flash (so does nexusone).- Panaromic desktop (i just couldn't think up enough things to put on them all).- Keyboard is better than droid.- Highres screen is nice.- Camera is responsive (better than the G1).Here's the downside:- Very thick (i mean uncomfortable in pocket thick).- Most menus only work in landscape mode (even the main menu).- Doesn't support exchange 2003 yet.- Screen is a finger print nightmare.- Very few supported app, no ovi store yet (not that thats saying much).Here's a list of my recent phones (last year) which was my base for comparison:- Blackberry Curve 8900 (excellent for a BB)- Blackberry Bold 9700 (not as good as 8900)- Nokia 5800 XpressMusic (loved it, it's not pretending to be a smartphone)- Nokia 5800 Navigation (same as above)- Nokia 5530 XpressMusic (same as above)- Nokia N97 (nice phone, not worth $$$)- Nokia N900 (brick)- Tmobile/HTC G1 (not bad for a first try)- Tmobile/HTC Touch Pro 2 (brick with weak software/os)- Motorola Droid (nice hardware, even better software)Nokia's real problem is that they have not managed to capture the imagination of developers like apple and google have. Its nice maemo is open source but why would a handset manufacturer use it when they can use android. And without widespread manufacturer support I don't see maemo making any real waves in the handset market.If you want to spend some $$$ on a smartphone I would take a look at iPhone 3GS (AT&T;), Palm Pre (SPRINT), Moto Droid (VZ) or HTC NexusOne (TMOB) depending on your carrier of choice.","January 8, 2010",

mobile phone,Not really a SMART phone in ease of use,"Ashok Krishnamoorthy ""Ashok all over the US""",R25DGG50TIJT5B,3,"This phone is a big brick with all the features you can find in a phone but nothing works perfectly.Let me begin with the maps. The maps are very slow. Its not a true GPS as you need internet connection (either through GPS or Wifi) to find your location. The GPS position moves slowly when you are driving. You don't have the flexibility to click on any point in the map and add it as a via point. Sure you can add point A, point B, Point C in an order for the GPS to give you a route from Point A to Point B and then to Point C. But if you want to modify a route the GPS gives you good luck with that.Now coming to the Gyro sensor. Its not that great. Sure you can change the orientation of the phone and other stuff with the Gyro. But you can use the GPS and internet in vertical orientation. Also you don't have multi-touch (which is only available in a hand full of phones) but atleast Nokia should've given people the ability to zoom into anything and take it to any zoom percentage. However you could achieve this by pressing the Volume Up and Volume Down button. But its not intuitive.The touch screen can be called a touchscreen because that's what it is. However it is no where as responsive as an iphone, nexus one, droid, droid incredible or other great smartphones. You really have to touch the same place two or three times.Also when you click on text fields the onboard touch screen keyboard doesn't pop-up instantly. Now coming to the lock button. The lock button is at the bottom of the phone rather than top of the phone and so it can't be unlocked with one hand (how stupid is that design).Now coming to the app store it sucks big time. nothing compared to that of Android or Iphone.

The screen itself feels extremely fragile, however, and I would not feel safe without a screen protector on it.CPU/GPU AND WIFI PERFORMANCE: 8/10The CPU and GPU handle nearly everything with aplomb. Wifi reception improves with Gingerbread, but range is still limited.CAMERA: 8/10I was pleasantly surprised by the high quality of the images the Nexus One produces, particularly outdoors without a flash.EXTRAS: 10/10The wired headset included with the Nexus One is above average when used for voice calls.BATTERY: 5/10Upgrading to Gingerbread will reduce power consumption for most tasks, but even then battery life is only average compared to similar devices. Battery temperature sometimes exceeds 45C (113F).BUILD QUALITY, DURABILITY AND APPEARANCE: 2/10It requires a LOT of pressure to release the battery cover, and I can feel the screen buckling under my fingers every time. The Nexus One is very fragile but overall looks good. The silver paint started coming off after one week of gentle use, and it malfunctions with high-heat activities (e.g. GPS and 3G internet). Add at least $30 to the cost to buy quality screen and body protectors.EXTERNAL SOUND AND AUDIO: 2/10The external speaker is just terrible.

It just became unusually warm (i would'nt really call it HOT!) near the processor even when i tried browsing or watching a youtube video. After some googling i found that was kinda normal with smart phones. In the beginning it was just getting warm, a few days later, it began restarting when that happened. It would get bricked in the start-up screen with the nexus logo. I had to remove the battery and let it cool down to get it to start working again. In the beginning this happened hardly, but the frequency just started going up. Last month it started happening EVERY SINGLE TIME i try to use the phone with the screen turned on (there seemed to be no problem when i used to talk on the phone, as the screen is turned off when i keep in near my ear, or listen to music with the screen turned off), i couldnt even type out a message..I hit google again and looked for solutions to the problem, but i could find nothing. I even reset to factory setting as the htc customer support guy said and still nothing. The problem was apparently the motherboard.THIS MIGHT JUST BE A MANUFACTURING DEFECT! I believe it cant be either google or amazon's fault. If at all you spot the problem early on, even when it isnt frequent or as bad, dont just tell yourself that you can live with that and go on for longer like i did. Return it immediately!THE PHONEHowever the phone itself was amazing as long as i could use it. The camera is absolutely stunning, the resolution may be a little low but the quality is just amazing, even in low light conditions. The screen even though not the best on the market today is still THE best screen you will get for this price, but i would recommend a screen guard, its not as scratch resistant as they say it is. Its fast enough for me since i dont make movies like Avatar and Transformers on it or play Crisis on my phone Lol (unlike the quad core phone owners, apparently :p). The track ball is redundant but its fun to play with. The phone seems solid and heavy and not like its made out of cheap plastic or anything. I remember the first time i looked and it and saw this awesome shine on it (both the metal and the plastic part), and i thought that it probably wont last, but even after over 3 months, it hasnt lost that lustre. I know its fast to say that but still that shine was something i really liked, something no other phone ive seen ever had. Well the battery part is decent, not too good not too bad maybe around 5-6 hours if you talk continuously and it can stay on for a whole day if you dont use it much. It's wifi was pretty bad though, i think its range was too less but im not really sure, just look it up before buying it, if that is important to you. The speaker was much louder than i expected and those headphones are just awesome. I think ive covered eveything... Overall its a great phone even without considering its cost. If this is your budget then dont look at anything else, cuz they are all a disappointment (except for the HTC wildfire, but it has a screen with lower res. so...meh! :p) Just PRAY that your piece is not defective.","May 10, 2012",

My PC couldn't recognize the cell phone after all needed guidance.3- the touch screen sometimes doesn't respond as expected.I read in interenet somemony articles about how to make the cell phone recognizable and ...etc.Finally I came up with the conclusion to return the product to seller.I might be unlucky with that cell phone as many are.","June 20, 2011",
mobile phone,"Great Platform, Stretched Hardware",Mike C.,R1YILMSTJ6GX8T,3,"I purchased this phone about a year ago and was initially ecstatic about the device's features as well as the intuitiveness of the Android platform itself. However, at the release of this device the Android platform was still growing and functioned in a much less advanced capacity than it currently does. Through several updates of core firmware, as well as various software updates to apps, the phone has become sluggish and often unresponsive.Long story short, the hardware hasn't kept up with the every-growing demands on the software front. The Android Marketplace offers a great breadth of content that is simply impractical to run on this outdated hardware. If you're looking to have a phone that keeps up with current technological trends, think twice before investing in this sucker.Also, battery life tends to become absolutely abysmal after the first 6-8 months or so, so definitely think about investing in some backup batteries.","June 21, 2011",

It randomly reboots itself and can't upgrade the O/S above Android 2.3, no apps for that. I chose this one because it had a keyboard, but after a few weeks it was easier to use the virtual keyboard.

I often don't use my cellphones much, so this was a nice option. It serves its purpose at a low price.The one bad thing about this phone, as someone else mentioned, is its ability to start surfing the web on its own. I've had situations where the phone was either off or key locked in my pocket, and would suddenly hear it making noises. It seems the buttons for turning the phone on or unlocking it stick out rather too prominently, allowing it to turn on and suddenly waste minutes surfing the web. (Wasted several phone minutes this way.)Other than that, its a nice no-frills phone for basic needs. I would have probably given it 5 stars if not for the annoying habit of it surfing on its own.","September 22, 2011",
mobile phone,Not the best in the land,"Wally ""The Great One""",R2BI57DLW1ZUS4,3,"I got this phone from Trscfone directly for $10.00 to try product and service. The phone needed firmware upgrades before being usable, I found it to meet expectations at that time. I found it annoying to have to accept Bluetooth paring every time it connected to my on star hands free system.The sound quality was good, for the pixel rate the camera was acceptable.All of the buttons were overly sensitive and would activate the browser and other functions weather in my pocket or case.Lastly after having the phone for 6 months, I accidently dropped it from less than three feet, the screen went blank with a quarter inch black stripe on the right side.I think its fair to say I got what I paid for, the money I saved from switching from a big carrier covered the cost.

The numeric pad placement is not well thought out. It is a struggle already to find the numeric pad in the center of the keyboard...how much more in the night because it is not lighted...but what else can you expect to a cheap phone. Maybe it takes time to get use to it. She is using it as a basic phone only and as a backup after office hours or during her off working days. It is cheap and it serves its intended purpose. She used to pay close to $50 a month to one of major phone carriers with all the above goodies she seldom used. She just bought $30 for 200 minutes load and that is good for 3 months.

Like others have said, if you press the end key fast enough you may be able to avoid getting minutes deducted. The other thing I am not a big fan of is the internet/browser system overall. It is kind of slow and the longer you stay on it the more minutes you are going to get deducted from your phone.

mobile phone,Not Impressed,JasonM,R226BS6UADDUR5,3,"Well, it has a keyboard and plays MP3. The camera is about useless. My old Samsung 301G has a 3.2 MP camera. The picture quality on it was pretty good. On this phone it's so grainy you can't make out any details. I was interested in the app capability. I downloaded the Facebook app. Wasted quite a few minutes on that. It loads, and the first screen is ""add friends"". The key to the right of the arrows is supposed to be the skip button. It doesn't work. That button works for everything else, including when I press the end button and get prompted if I want to quit Facebook. The same key is the ""no"" response. It works for that. So, I tried to find a friend, and it tells me I need to download an upgrade. I get charged 3 minutes when I hit ok, the it tells me I'm disconnected. I've tried several times, and I'm giving up on the app. When I browse to the Facebook site, I can type a status update, but I can't get the phone to scroll over to the ""post"" button. The only way I can update my status is by texting to my Facebook account's upload email address. This only costs me a third of a minute, which is cheaper than opening the browser anyway.The Mp3 player is a nice option, but occasionally I get an error right in the middle of a song and it stops playing. The sound quality isn't bad for a phone when it works. I do like that I can listen to music when I take a walk without carrying a seperate device. I do like having a keyboard to send texts, but the keys are tiny. I have large fingers and manage with only an occasional typo. I use my thumbnail rather than the end of a finger. Seems to work a little better that way.I tried to transfer my old number over online. Found out the included SIM card was defective. I had to call them and wait several days for a free replacement SIM from Tracfone. Once it arrived I called them 2 or 3 times before I got the phone activated. They never did get my old number transferred to the new phone. They told me it should be within an hour. They had me type all kinds of codes into the phone and the minutes transferred over, but not my number. I gave up and just used the new phone number. Not happy at all with the transaction, and wish I had just kept using the old Samsung 301G I had, and purchased an MP3 player.","December 8, 2011",

mobile phone,Rural problems,Oldanalyst,R3TQDIEMRFXZ27,3,"I thought it would be nice to upgrade to a phone that can take videos. I had an LG501C and kept wishing I could take videos as well as stills. So I spent a few bucks to buy an LG500G. It worked well although the ports seemed a bit more flimsy than those on the 501. However, the reception was generally 2 bars less than the 501 and sometimes completely disappeared. I called Tracfone and after going through 3 levels of help, finally got a reason. I was told that phones with a SIM card can not use the same cell towers (Verizon) as those without a SIM card. The person recommended that I get a phone without a card. After some searching, she told me that the 501 was the only such phone that would work in my rural area. So I had my phone switched back to the 501 and enjoy very strong signals. I guess the only way I am going to get a video phone is to switch to a non-Tracfone system. I refuse to do this because of the considerable difference in cost. So I will put up with no video but a strong signal. I would rate the 500 as a 4 but the reception for me as a 2 so for the purpose of this review, I'll give an overall rating of 3.","September 20, 2012",

I can't find out anyplace on the web how to make it work and customer service stinks. I have tried their website, calling customer service, support tickets, and even their forum. With no luck on getting any answers. So, far the phone itself seems like a really nice phone with very small keys. My 15 year old loves it for the ring tones and mp3 player.

The phone worked reasonably well. Whenever I put it in my pocket without turning it off, however, there was a high probability that a button would get bumped and the phone would connect to the internet or occasionally call home. Last month I dove on some grass to catch a ball, forgetting I had the phone in my pocket. The next time I looked at it, the screen was obscured. I can still make calls but can't see anything.

The camera could be better and I was mislead to believe that you could download apps..... you can't as far as I know there aren't any apps... I tried downloading about 14 different ones that were suppose to be for my phone and they didn't work. They were ""not compatible"". I do like the Mp3 player, I have 30 songs on it, I like the bluetooth capability and the cable to transfer pictures and songs. The games are expensive I think, 65 minutes or $5 per game. I did not add any games. I am wondering if this is a good buy just for an mp3 player for my kids... they sure like it and its large enough to not get lost! Cheap enough to replace if they do! :)Overall good price, texting is fine the letters are tiny but you get use to it, nice accessories, phone calls are clear with great reception, nice mp3 player, and I like the option of using the camera and sending the pics for free to my computer! :) I like speed dial too keeps you from misdialing :)","July 31, 2012",

No fm radio and changing settings is a major headache. Retrieving messages is not easy. Had to ask about changing to DST, you have to take out the battery and it resets on replacement! Getting on the internet is very problematic. Just a badly designed UI and poor directions spoil an otherwise fine product. My previous Tracfone was a Motorola flip which was lost, bulkier and without a qwerty but much easier to setup and use.

mobile phone,Lost $100 after LG 500G was inactivated,Gopher Kay,R2T6J91O4MWEFN,3,"This was a great, simple, no frills phone before it was inactivated due to an expired service date. Tracfone sent a free replacement SIM. I bought a card for 1 year service and 400 minutes ($100). Replacing the SIM resulted in the message ""Unregistered SIM"". Multiple attempts to reprogram the LG 500G via Tracfone customer service were futile. I bought another Tracfone because Tracfone customer service declared the LG 500G dead, i.e unable to be registered on the cell phone network. and I was reassured that I could transfer the 1 year service and 400 minutes ($100) to the new Tracfone. The online transfer and interaction with 2 customer service representatives from Tracfone resulted in a LOSS of the 1 year service and 400 minutes ($100). I am sure there is some clause in Tracfone's terms of service that does not allow a refund. Be aware, that once the LG 500G is out of warranty and not able to be programmed to connect to the cell network, it becomes a paperweight. This is truly a disposable cellphone, especially in the context of the current advances in cell phone technology.Conclusion: Tracfones are disposable phones. Trash when dead. Tracfone customer service is MOST unsatisfactory.","December 18, 2013",

mobile phone,Unacceptable performance on all levels,Grandma Polly,R1VI0MZCH1BKL3,3,"This was a gift from family member, who unfortunately decided I needed the newest, most featured electronic device available. They bought it with the contract with Verizon.Unfortunately what I needed is a new cell phone, not a multipurpose small computer. I carry my cell phone when driving or working outside for safety to call for help in event of an accident. It uses Sprint service and there is good service within 50 miles radius of my home.Since I am on the edge of Verizon service in my area, this connection is weak.To use the dial features, I have to put on my reading glasses and make multiple swipes to make the IPhone call anybody. Siri does not work at all without excellent connection service so a major feature that might have worked is not available to me.Because of the poor reception area, the IPhone keeps searching all the time for a good signal. This decreases the battery life to about 4 hours.It would be a great phone for someone in a city, who does not use reading glasses, accesses internet for sports scores and plays on-line games. It is of no value to me at all.","May 19, 2013",

mobile phone,IPhone 4,larsen7pr,R3AGV0XFT13CGN,3,"The product that I reviewed is an IPhone 4. I will tell you an experience. I got the ios 7 upgrade,and it took 1-2 hours to load and to upgrade. When I got the upgrade,I was playing with my phone and I accidentally dropped it 2 times. The next day I couldn't really see the screen because it wasn't bright enough. It turns out that the brightness was fully on. The phone was on and working, but the brightness wasn't working. I could only see a little of the screen in front of a light. I'm not impressed about the upgrade as much as I was before. Here's the good news,I can probably get it fixed when the next upgrade comes out. The bad news is,the next upgrade is in January of next year. I think that it is a good product overall. The product is an IPhone 4. It costs about $100 to about $500 dollars. The colors of the IPhone 4 are: White, and Black. The IPhone has games,apps,utilities,and more. The product is sold worldwide in most countries at Apple,Verizon,Amazon,Best Buy,AT&T;,and most Electronic Stores.

mobile phone,Black Iphone 4,Jason,R3BXKXGIGMD7DZ,3,"I have recently gone back to the Iphone 4. It is still a fine phone even with all the newer Android phones, the only thing that doesn't stand the test of time is the size of the screen.LOOK & DESIGN (NOT SCREEN)The black Iphone 4 has a nice sleek look to it. It's smooth black casing that protects the inner battery and the camera, It helps protect the phone from drops also, the iphone 4 is very durable if you drop it screen side up. Screen side down is completely different story.SCREEN SIZEThe 4.5X2,3 inch screen is way to small now with all the phones out now. Some of the Windows and Android phones have screens the size of some of the smaller tablets. The screen is very clean,clear, but it is just tiny and isn't big enough to watch Netflix, play games, or watch youtube videos comfortably without straining your eyes.STORAGEThe Apple people know what they are doing. The fact that you can't have a SD card is ridiculous. You have to squeeze all of your games, music, apps, and photos in 16 Gigs. It is easy to do unless you have an extensive collection of music or movies. If you want more storage you have to buy the 32 gig or 64 gig Iphone. It gets annoying when the new IOS come out and you have to delete stuff just to download the new operating system for your phone.HOME SCREENThe start up screen has a very nice look to it. If you group all of your apps together you can do anything directly from the start up screen like call your mom, play pandora, start itunes, check your calender, search the internet. It is a very user friendly interface and didn't take me long to figure out all of the in's and out's of the Iphone $.BATTERY LIFEAlong with the screen size this might be the thing that iphone fans complain about the most. If you are playing a lot of games your battery will last you 4-6 hours before you need to plus it in. What is the point of having to be tethered to your charger? Sure it could last all day if you only use your phone for random google searches or the occasional itunes song. Most people don't do that, at some point their phone gets a lot of use and it drains there battery pretty quickly. I hope when the Iphone 6 comes out this is fixed.CONCLUSIONThe iphone has became just another smart phone. They once where the innovators of the phone world. Now it seems like they are just posturing. Coming out with small advancements one phone cycle at a time. The Galaxy is now water proof, i know Apple can do that too. Writing this review made me realzie how unhappy I am with Apple and as a loyal Iphone fan I might be making the dread jump to Android if there isn't something amazing coming in the future very soon.","May 18, 2014",

mobile phone,Flaws within some of the key features made this phone a bit disappointing,David L,R1ENOGXLH20ARP,3,First off i purchased this phone for my girlfriend for Christmas last year. Now my girlfriend loves pictures and taking pictures and using apps to edit them into collages. So when i found this phone with a nice 5 inch screen and a 10MP camera with flash at a very offordable price i was all over it. However some flaws with the camera kept her from enjoying it like we wanted. For example it says 10mp camera however the quality of the pictures look nothing like it and no its not because i have the settings wrong...it just doesnt look that good and the flash is COMPLETELY UNUSABLE. When you take a picture with the flash its like the timing of the flash is off and the picture always has excess brightness...then on top of that about 2 weeks ago the camera button on the bottom right side of the phone quit working so its difficult to take pictures of us together.As far as the actual phone it actually works really well with no white noise and never drops a call unless signal is completely lost. Battery life is not the best but not bad either about 10 hours with moderate use. No over heating and downloads/runs most apps quite smoothly.So overall the phone is not too bad just i meant this review to be a warning to the people like me who are thinking about buying this phone for picture/media related purposes. If thats the case i strongly advise you considering other options.,"July 9, 2013",

mobile phone,Used Droid X,Scott Price,R1IMH30UUBO8TO,3,"The phone came in pristine condition with only a few minor blemishes on it, you honestly could barely tell if you looked closely that it wasn't brand new. It obviously didn't come with the Motorola Packaging or with a micro SD card which were minor hits as I used my old SD from my OG Droid. Overall pretty satisfied with the phone and would purchase another phone this way without having to extend my contract. Any disappointments with the phone were purely hardware/software based but given that the phone is 14 months old at the time of purchase isn't surprising (I'm a bit of a geek and like to modify my phones, should have known that Motorola locks the boot-loaders to ridiculous levels). Not a fan of the Moto-Blur skin that Motorola now uses on all of their phones, kind of a bummer coming from a ""pure Android"" experience from the Original Droid. Doubt that would effect the average person just looking to replace a broken phone or someone looking for a bargain without having to extend their contract.","January 28, 2012",

First world problems right.Luckily I can get all of the android apps that I had on my last phone, so it's not too much of a downgrade.The call quality is fine, the camera sucks.

mobile phone,Not happy at least when used with Sprint,Picante,R3MVQ5W737XQRP,3,"My biggest complaint is the poor reception characteristic of this phone. I have found a number of other factors to be somewhat obtuse. To be fair, most of the problems that I have had are probably tied strongly to Sprint. The phone's reception is just poor, however, as other Sprint users get signal on other phones when I cannot get service on mine. If you primarily use your phone outside in a nice flat area with lots of towers and no large buildings, or just use it as a camera, you may be happy with this phone. Personally, I get tired of having to walk outside to get decent reception. The battery runs down fast if I use the 4G or bluetooth features, otherwise, it is OK and it does recharge quickly.","November 26, 2012",

mobile phone,Its a Gamble!,Chris Macias,R136X5Y58YDG64,3,"The GT-i9100, also known as the Galaxy S II is one of the best android phones on the market. However, there are two factors that prevent it from attaining a perfect score. Firstly, there are known problems with the camera sensor, there are two different kinds out there, and it is mostly up to chance whether you get one that works or one that doesn't. The other issue is really poor samsung support, after scouring the xda forums for a solution it was evident that a possible firmware solution to this problem, has yet to be released to the public.Design: This is one of the thinnest dual core phones out of the market. Coming in slightly thinner than my girlfriends iPhone 4s. I appreciate the fact that the headphone jack is located at the top of the device. My previous Droid (Inspire 4g) had both the usb port and headphone jack on the bottom of the device, it was quite crowded, and unsightly. You have your volume rocker on the left side of the device. It can sometimes be difficult to tell if you are hitting the button, as the volume rocker cannot wake up the device. The power button is located on the right side of the device. This is not only an odd place for the button, but it can be very irritating if you are holding the device with one hand and accidentally hit the power button, forcing you to re-enter your PIN or Pattern. I think the power button would have been fine up top with the head phone jack.The international has one tactile button and two capacitive buttons. This is one button less than the American version, which has a dedicated search button. While initially i missed the dedicated search button I have learned to live without it. The tactile button is your home button similar to the iPhone, you press this to take you back to your home-screen. You can double tap to activate Samsung's voice command module. The capacitive button to the left is your menu button, and the one to your right is your back arrow button. Both are responsive and function the same as the American version.Display: The super AMOLED screen is bright, and vibrant. It is large and responsive. Supposedly some devices have had the dreaded oil slick issue, fortunately I did not have that in my unit. However, this further adds to the gamble of purchasing this device. This thing is a finger print magnet, if you don't have a screen protector (I'm waiting on mine) you may want to carry a microfiber cloth on you so you can wipe off smudges.Software: One of the major advantages to purchasing the international version is the fact that it does not have any carrier bloatware. The device is travel friendly since it has a quad band radio and unlocked sim card. The Touch-Wiz 4.0 interface is lightweight and does not appear to bog down the processor. All the built in android OS features are there such as the wireless hotspot, and USB tethering abilities. These features are traditionally removed in the American version to force you into shelling out more money on to their two year contracts with them. The device can handle multi-tasking beautifully, and picks up GPS signal much faster than my Inspire 4G.Camera: Probably the most disappointing thing about the unit I have received. Unfortunately I have a faulty Fujitsu module. I have yet to determine if this is merely a firmware issue, or a true hardware flaw. The camera cannot focus on any object at all. Close up photos work well. However, this is hardly practical. The front facing camera appears to be okay, though I have only used it a couple of times. In either case, you may be out of luck with warranty support if you are stateside.Battery: The battery life on this thing is excellent. I can stream music continously for up to 6-6.5 hrs before I have to plug in. With light Internet browsing it can easily last for 1-1.5 days That is a significant improvement over the Inspire 4g I had which had to be plugged in to last the day.Overall: I really enjoy this device. I love it. However, I am truly disappointed over the camera. I have given much thought about this, and decided I will try to stick it out. I hardly ever take photos, and I love everything else about the phone so its hard to say that it is a deal breaker for what I need it for, which is, mainly calls, messaging, and light Internet browsing with the occasional navigation.","March 13, 2012",

However, at least I DID get the 1200 minutes, 1-year activation and am told that I will be getting the triple minutes for life, even with the new phone (haven't tested this by buying minutes, yet).I'd encourage potential buyers to call Tracfone and make sure the LG800g will work in your area, but then, most folks do not live as far in the boonies as we do!The LG501g is ok but will likely end up being given to my middle-schooler, who does not mind the tiny buttons; my search for a phone continues!","August 8, 2011",
mobile phone,Language Change: Spanish to English Tracfone LG800G,J. Corpe,RGTA2VYYW6L3Q,3,"I bought this phone for my friend and within a month, she had accidentally set the phone's language setting from English to Spanish. If you don't know Spanish, this can be a pain to fix! I'm not really reviewing the phone. This ""review"" is my version of tech support for everyone who has purchased a Tracfone LG800G, and cannot find anything in the phone's guide about how to fix this. Also note that I'm doing this primarily because several other reviews I read had people complaining about the issue, yet they didn't share any helpful knowledge with us.Here you go Internet:1. Choose the dice looking icon (which is the shortcut to the menu). 2. Choose the gear icon labeled Configuracion (settings). 3. Next choose Telefona (phone). 4. Choose Idioma (language). 5. Finally, if you're following along, you should see English. Click that and it will be saved.Hopefully this will save you the hour I spent trying to find an answer to the problem and staggering through the menu system blindly pressing buttons.","January 8, 2012",
mobile phone,Some Buyers Remorse,"Mr. Cheap Skate ""Mr.Cheap Skate""",RT7ADHCRUT6Y4,3,"Well I have had an older basic Tracfone for a few years and have had affordable mobile cell phone use at very low cost for myself and my wife. I read the reviews on this LG800G and at first did not go for it because of some of the negative comments. The phone arrived priorty Mail 5 days after I ordered it. Inside the box was the familiar Tracfone package and the LG800G life time triple minute phone inside. Also a sheet of paper explaining how to add the minutes and the pin number for the minutes on the same sheet of paper. Activating the phone first online was easy(phone comes with 20 minutes), then adding the 400 minute 1 year (1200 after tripling) minutes using the tracfone online site also worked fine and i got 1220 minutes and 425 days of service. This is the best way to deal with Tracfone...add minutes online. My main gripe is the touch screen. First it feels like frosted plastic. Second it is not as senstative to touch as I hoped for. I have an Ipod 4th generation and so I am spoiled. I put a screen protector on it as soon as i could because it just seems very ""scratchable"". I was concerned about accidental Internet ""browsing"" but I was able to move the Icon for that off the main screen. Also I tried the browser very breifly and it was just .5 unit for under the minute i was connected. It gave me a warning I was about to go online and gave me the option to back out. I did not go any further with that until I find the manual for the phone that is suppose to be somewhere on the Tracfone Website. The Manual that comes with the phone (English and Spanish) is not bad for basic use but not enough for all the options. It doesnt tell you want happens after you hit the browser Icon...It will be trial and error as your minutes get used up. Text message was .3 unit and seems fine. I have not talked on it yet but dont expect that to be any less than what I am accustomed to with my older Tracfone. This LG800G phone is ok but don't expect good touch experience. I wanted the ablilty to occasionally get on the web to check email and that is why i upgraded to this level. I liked the design of the Tracfone T404G slide out keyboard but was concerned about the many accidental browser button mishaps reported in the reviews...no touch screen to compalin about with that phone...so I did not get it...mabye I should have gotten it? There is my remorse. I am going to keep the LG 800G phone anyway. I did not order a USB Cable because I have so many cables I thought i would have one that fits...WRong! LG cable needed for this phone. There is a $2.5O cable on Amazon that I just orded today...includes shipping. If you don't have the cable you can't connect the phone to your PC to put things on the micro sd card ( you need to buy that too)...it sits under the battery inside the phone...that would be a hassle to remove it everytime you wanted to add or delete MP3 songes or whatever to the card ( and mabye lose all yur settings you made on the phone)...so you will need the cable. The 1200 one year minute deal is great so I am happy with that. Tracfone is still in my opinion a good way to go for people who want mobile phone use at the lowest possible cost. Very nice to have when on vacation!!!!! Good Luck with your decision and hope you make the best choice for you! Hopes this helps!","January 26, 2012",

mobile phone,Buttons keep getting pressed while in pocket,The Engineer Critic,R16NRR22X2I4L5,3,"I use this phone for infrequent calls and it seems like a good deal for a year of service.My main issue with this phone is that buttons are getting pressed when it's in my pocket, causing it to randomly call people and waste my minutes. I guess we had better watch what we say since the phone might have called somebody. :-)I would switch back to a flip-phone if Tracfone offered a decent one. At least the buttons would be covered.On a few occasions, the phone powered itself off and could not be turned on. It was necessary to remove and reinstall the battery to get the phone working again.Also, if you use another phone to check your voicemail instead of wasting your Tracfone minutes, note that the phone will still indicate that you have voicemail messages even after you've deleted them using another phone. It seems that you need to call voicemail from this Tracfone (wasting a minute or two) to clear this.","June 25, 2012",
mobile phone,very confusing phone,rob eaton,R3QSEHQWLZ6P9O,3,"I have had this phone for 3 weeks. The phone calls are fine and clear. Very difficult to set up. Must have customer service connect some of the ""features"", if you can understand very heavily accented chinglish. Still can not send e-mail or e-mail photos, even following instructions letter by letter. Expect a very steep learning curve on this phone. Phone quality deserves 5 stars. Ease of operation deserves 2 stars and customer service gets none. There is a ""press-and-hold-to-unlock"" button which can not be dis-engaged, lives in the way of every task you want to do and is extremely frustrating in it's repeated insistence at every screen change.

mobile phone,"Great value, but could be better",Simple Sign,R2KQZ2I4095NLO,3,"For the price, this phone plus the amount of minutes you get is an amazing deal. Other people have gone on and on about that, so I will focus on the sticklers and why I gave this product 3 stars. I've owned the phone for 2 months now.The phone itself goes unresponsive if left alone for long periods of time. It has trouble coming out of stand-by mode or whichever you wish to call it. The only way to wake it up is to fiddle with the power button, and even then it takes a good 20 seconds. Fortunately it responds just fine when receiving phone calls.As others have stated, it is so very easy to accidentally hit the internet button on the phone. You will be immediately charged just for accessing the internet, then charged a rate after that. If you don't catch this as it happens...you will lose a *lot* of minutes. Be warned. I bought a silicone casing LG Cookie Style (800G) Gel Skin Case - Black that reduces this risk considerably by making that icon harder to accidentally push. UPDATE: You can also remove the browser icon from the screen. Gel case still recommended for durability.UPDATE #2: To get the most out of this phone you are going to need a Micro SDHC card. The max memory this phone can hold is 4 gigs. I bought Sandisk 4GB MicroSDHC Memory Card with SD Adapter (BULK Packaging) and it works just peachy after I formatted it. It would *not* work before the format, and you will need a computer with a microSD card reader to do the formatting! If your card is incompatible/wrong format, the phone will let you know by displaying a tiny crossed out memory card logo on the top of the screen. For those wondering, the proper format for this phone is FAT(File-Allocation-Table).The coverage in my area sucks. Not this phone's fault, and I am not docking stars for that. Do your homework and find out if it will work in your area before buying.Lastly, if you do buy this phone, keep your old number. The phone number provided gets calls/texts/pictures *all* the time from people I don't know. It is quite amusing, but not all people would think so.UPDATE #3: The Tracphone site *sometimes* has an option for 250 bonus minutes(promo code needed) when you add the one year card subscription(this phone comes with that exact card, how nice!). So if you set up your minutes online, make sure to hunt down that promo code when adding your minutes!","August 4, 2012",

However, I live in a mountainous area and the cell phone doesn't work at my house. My previous similar Tracfone at least got a little bit of coverage. I also recently had an issue when I was out of state attending a conference. I was texting my husband who was in the same vicinity about a very urgent matter, and the phone kept dropping the calls. Very annoying. My husband's smart phone works fine in all the aforementioned situations where my Tracfone doesn't. So, with its limitations, it's a good deal.

mobile phone,Great offer on a sub-sub-par device,luke doty,RXA9Z0Q5RYDGO,3,"The main reason I purchased this phone is for the triple minutes, and in that respect it is a great phone. If you're using tracfone long-term, it's a worthwhile investment. This phone's issues have a lot more to do with usability. The touch screen is laggy and imprecise, at best. It is apparent in many aspects of the design that insufficient time, money, or effort were invested. For instance, although you can use a keyboard to text people, you have to use the old 9-key input method to add a contact to your phone. The device is loaded with this little inconveniences which, although not the end of the world, make it frustrating to use. Another example: I am a male with what I perceive to be ordinary-size fingers and good hand-eye coordination. But I have immense trouble typing with the keyboard. It's a gamble every time whether the phone will recognize the letter I pressed or the one next to it, or whether it will respond at all. Similarly, when I click to start writing a text, cancel sending a text, answer a call, wake the phone up, anything, the phone has a substantial delay before responding. And sometimes it just doesn't respond. So a good portion of the time, I'll press a button for the phone to do something, see that nothing is happening, and press again right as the phone does the initial task, only for it to recognize the second pressing and go off on another entirely unintended task.Long story short, I am glad I have this phone. The triple minutes are great. But if the triple minutes were ever available on literally any other device, I would recommend avoiding this phone. It's a great offer on a less-than-mediocre device.","September 4, 2012",

mobile phone,Received this phone yesterday,W. Brunner,R2X6ZHWH5BW2WQ,3,"I've been using a very dependable Blackberry for about 14 yrs, the same one. Worked great. There are three of us bundled on a family plan and we decided it was time to end the expensive contract.We first bought a Samsung Proclaim with the air time from HSN. Without notification, they canceled the order stating they could not fill all the orders.We then bought the same phone on Amazon and have been trying to work with that for just about a month.I personally don't like it and no one was able to use much of the phone without a capacitive stylus. I ordered the stylus on Amazon, that order was lost in the mail.With only a week left to buy my phone, I read the reviews for this LG800 phone.I had little issue transferring my old number via the computer. Activating it was another story.I waited 12 hours and decided to call for help. I got an automated answering system that had me go through numerous codes of nearly 200 some letters to input into the phone. It did work after a very frustrating time with the machine not accepting my voice prompts. I have only made a couple of calls so far and not at all impressed with the speaker phone, which is what I use exclusively. It starts to break up at about 50% volume and gets worse.The phone looks and feels nice. I liked the features, what I could understand of them. The case leaves a lot to be desired.I will be missing the blackberry for sure. I may have to find another phone however.No evaluation is being given for many of the phone funtions. I am just reviewing the issues I had getting service and using the speaker phone.I would not recommend this for anyone that does not have a house phone with speaker phone options, which I would higly recommend be used, to activate the new phone.Update: 9/18/12I received a second phone and upgraded my rating to 3 stars. I asked for a replacement phone just to see if the loud speaker worked any better. I found they are good up to 3-4 bars. Not so great after that and IMO, the weak link in the phone.An inexpensive capacitive stylus does wonders.When I activated the first phone, I had to enter at least two hundred digits. The second was much easier, except, I was not able to transfer the account by the web site as the minute balance did not match and I would have lost a few hundred. When I did activate, the web site offered another 200 minutes, which the representative did add to the phone.The case that comes with it, not so good. However, I used an I-pod case I bought earier in the year. That works super! It hangs lower on the waist, and looks great.Have to see if I can locate that information in my files.Lots of nice features on this phone. I have left it on standby for about a week so far. Still has a full charge. My Blackberry would have been dead in two days.update 12/23/2012The original phone no longer held a charge and became difficult to turn on. A replacement phone was received in 3 days. To activate the new phone, I had to call Tracphone about 5 times until I was able to reach someone. In the process, I had to again input well over 100 digits of code. I then found the woman put the wrong phone number in the phone. I did not find that out until I needed the phone and was not able to receive any calls.When I called back to straighten that out, I was then told I had double minutes for life, instead of triple minutes. Still working on that issue.Sure was a lot easier dealing with problems via ATT. Thankfully I still have a land line to use to get this phone to work.I found that keeping the phone set to airtime info did not allow me to bump the broswer and waist minutes by mistake.A nice phone when it works properly.I do miss not being able to input more information such as addresses, extensions and names etc., for each entry.update: 12/23/12 Five or so hours later, I still can not use the phone. My original phone number was not transferred to the replacement, reconditioned phone. Now on my 4th tracphone rep and hours later, not so thrilled to have to wait another 3-5 days for yet another SIM car so I can get my original phone number reinstated. One rep I had to hang up on due to very poor phone connection, that after 15 minutes attempting to work with that person.I never had problems like this with ATT. Thankfully, I do not depend on nor need this phone very much.","September 6, 2012",
mobile phone,Good deal comes with texting problems,sunder,R1DQOG5PFOOOLW,3,"Great deal on the minutes, bought for the QWERTY. Nice touch-screen interface. Unfortunately, the upside of this phone is outweighed by problems with texting. In an area deemed by Tracfone as ""the best area for reception,"" the phone began to receive duplicate text messages (hundreds of them) that rendered the phone useless for in/out texting. It is unclear what causes the problem, but possibly texts long enough to trigger splitting them into two. This problem can go on for days and recurs often. Tracfone customer service was unable to fix the problem, after many hours spent on the phone with them. When they ""elevate"" the call to a specialist who has better capability to provide a solution, the specialist must call back according to an appointment time, which they missed by three hours. After rescheduling, they never called again, and claimed to have no record of the elevation. We attempted to resolve this in three four-plus-hour phone sessions with Tracfone, to no avail. And they never offered or agreed to replace the phone when I suggested that as a solution.Not usually one to complain, but fair warning: This appears to be a problem with this model, since our simple Samsung slider never had these problems. Bought three for the family -- one has had no problems (short texter in a different zip code), one has occasional problems, and the third one (nothing but problems) from the ""best area"" zip code seems to have finally stopped duplicating and will now allow accumulated texts through after driving out of the zip code. Go figure.Update to review: Son went to college and immediately began to experience the same text problems (used in an ""excellent coverage"" zone). Spent another 3+ hours with Tracfone customer service (in addition to the 12+ logged hours trying to fix the same problem with my daughter's phone at college - didn't get fixed - and they insisted they had no record of our previous calls, until I read back the transcripts from those calls - long story, but yes I had the whole thing). Tracfone finally agreed to replace our phones but refused to replace my son's with a triple-minute since their system showed him as only having double minutes, instead sending a reconditioned phone that is not even on the list for our zip code. And just today, my daughter began having the same multiple-receipt of same texts again. Such a frustrating experience. Be wary; weigh how dependable you want the phone to be, and verify upon activation that you will indeed receive 3x minutes when you add minutes, or you may be very disappointed. Extremely frustrating experience. Rude customer service.","March 3, 2012",

If you live in any rural area, put in the zip code of two or three of the towns around you. This will tell you if this phone really does work pretty well around in your area. My address has one zip code but where I actually live is closer to another zip code which Tracfone says a different phone works better. It has been a three ring cirucus trying to get this phone that I purchased switched to the phone that should actually work in my area. I normally am on the phone an hour to get one little simple thing done. It has been a big put off to staying with Tracfone. In many areas a GSM technology phone works. But in really rural areas you need to get the CDMA technology phone--like it has a C in the model number instead of a G. It's been going on about a month and still have not gotten this resolved. I will probably try to call Florida this week to get this all straightened out. In the meantime, no phone. Not sure how many people have this much trouble but it seems the nicer you are on the phone the more dilemas you have.","February 25, 2012",

It sounded like a good deal and I had hoped the triple minutes applied to the 1200, but at least it is for life. The rollover days are nice as well. This way you do not lose any minutes. 3 texts per minute is pretty nice. I am new to the touchscreens. Well, let me just get right into it. The calibration touch does not seem to change anything. The QWERTY keyboard would be more useful if you could use it to help transfer over all those contacts if you need to swith phone carriers. The lockscreen is annoying when you ar in the middle of setting up your voicemail even after you turn off this function.

mobile phone,Decent unlocked smart phone for the price.,Eliza,R237T5FMFVTEC0,3,"I bought this unlocked phone to see me through the rest of my current cell phone contract after my basic non-smart phone gave up on life. The main things that attracted me to this phone was qwerty keyboard, the price tag and the wifi capabilities. I don't currently have a data plan and didn't want to get one, but live in a city where there's free wifi readily available just about everywhere.I've had this phone for just over a week and here are my main issues:Wifi/3G:The first thing the phone requires you do to is to set up an Palm profile. The phone will automatically connect to 3G and uses data to do this. The phone also frequently checks for updates and if you set up your email through the phone it'll frequently check in to give you up to date emails. I bet these are neat features if you have an unlimited data plan, but if you have anything less than unlimited you should be aware of the frequent updates and backups that will drain your data and cause you to go over. This is apparently a common problem with AT&T.; You can turn off 3G and set the phone to wifi which is what I've done.Alarm clock:You can't sent alarms to go off on custom days. You can only choose ring once, daily, weekdays or weekends. In the end you have find an alarm app that will allow you to set custom days if you have any needs for custom alarms like I do.The alarm sometimes won't go off but will only vibrate, even when you have it set to make a sound. If you hit snooze the alarm does not sound when it goes off again but will vibrate only.When the alarm is set the alarm notification shows up at the bottom right of your screen, rather than the top left, like every other phone I've ever had, so you have to know where to look. If the screen locks and you unlock it there is a perplexingly large notification on the bottom of the your screen letting you know there's an upcoming alarm. I don't know why this is necessary.I ended up downloading an app to use as an alarm clock. I think it's kind of stupid that I have to find apps to replace the phone's built in functions.Vibration:I haven't found anywhere to adjust the strenght of the vibration. The vibration can be described as subtle, or discreet. It's weak to the point where I didn't feel the phone vibrating when it was on my lap while I was driving. Not being able to feel the phones vibration over the vibrations of the car is quite a drawback for me. This also means that when the phone is on the bedside table next to me sleeping head, quietly vibrating to let me know my snooze alarm is up, I don't hear it and oversleep for work. True story.Contacts:Once you have your email set up and download a facebook app all of your email and facebook contacts will automatically be imported to your contact list. Instead of having the 30 or so phone numbers of people I programmed in ready to go, I now have a list that's 100s of people long. The list just alphabetized - you can pick if you want it by first or last name, but it doesn't sub-categorize where the contacts came from. It would have been neat if it just had a little tabs for facebook/gmail/simcard or something. If you try to clean up the contact list by deleting all these extra people the phone will tell you ""facebook profile can't be deleted"". You can, when you have the contact card open go to preferences and set it to only show you names saved in your palm profile, or only names saved on your sim. I was really annoyed that it didn't ask permission or give any sort of notification about this mass importing of contacts. People I have as facebook friends only are there for a reason. If I wanted to call them I would have programmed their numbers into my phone to begin with. I read up about it and and app called Supercontacts was recommended as a way to manage this overload of people. Again, I think it's sort of ridiculous that you need an app to get your phone to be functional.Palm Apps:My only frame of reference is the apple app store we use for our Ipod touch. In comparison, this palm app store is cluttered and clunky and difficult to navigate. You can sort apps into ""hottest right now"" and ""new"" and alphabetical, but I really miss easily being able to pull up the top 100 free and paid apps. I miss being able to group apps into categories like you can on the Iphone/Itouch - instead you just have an endless list of stuff. It's harder to navigate and not really intuitive. It's hard to search for apps that do a certain function without knowing the name - the search doesn't autocomplete and start pulling up things that you might mean. I had to look as various online reviews and suggestions and then go back to my phone to look for those apps.The only other issue I have with this phone is that I wish I could have programmed it to have the screen wake up if I push any button. Currently you have to touch the power button to wake the screen and then drag the lock icon upwards to unlock the screen. This is fine, but I miss that extra bit of customizing that my old cheapo cellphone had.The phone is pretty fast, call quality is good and there's a good collection of preprogrammed ring tones. It's pretty easy to get used to although I had to look up what all the gestures were plus I didn't realize the black part below the screen was part of the touch screen and where you swipe to the left to go back/minimize.I'm happy I got this phone since it's a huge step up from what I had (LG Neon - would not recommend) but if I got this phone from a cellphone provider as part of a contract it would be going back for something that's a bit more streamlined and something where I can set custom days on an alarm clock. This phone taught me that not being able to set custom days is pretty much a deal breaker.Update: 01/2012: I've grown use to this phone and am enjoying it. The alarm function still sucks - even on the alarm app I downloaded it'll only ring when it first goes off and all subsequent snoozes are vibrate only. I can't be the only person with this issue, right?In the comments people asked about if it comes with a data cable. The phone had a cable that is a usb/micro usb in the box, with a wall attachment so you can charge the phone either by plugging it into the wall or your computer. It's the exact same cord the Kindle uses, incase you're not familiar with what a micro usb is. I haven't attempted to use this as a data cable, but when you plug it into a computer a message pops up on the screen that asks you ""charge only or usb"" and you can pick.My current cell provider is AT&T; and they did NOT require me to buy a data plan with the phone. They require you to get a data plan when you get a smart phone from them but apparently not if you just buy an unlocked one. The phone is branded AT&T;, and my sim card is with AT&T;, so I can't really say if the phone is actually unlocked. I assume it really is since there are reviews on there from people with different cell phone providers.I would recommend this phone if you're looking for a cheap compact phone with smart phone capabilities. I used the smart phone capabilities pretty infrequently, and I can get away with charging it only every other day. One of my favourite features is the qwerty keyboard for txting. The only issue I've had with it in all the months I've owned it is that the m of the palm emblem on the back of the phone peeled off. Nothing else. No problems with it freezing or switching itself off or dropping calls.","August 30, 2011",

mobile phone,"Small phone, great value.",Jeffrey,R18TZNFOCZT3DP,3,"This phone does not have the newest version of WebOS. It has 1.45, vs 3.0 for the Touchpad. The keypad is very small and hard to type on. Seems like the perfect phone for younger teenagers. The phone itself has nice features for the great bargain of 70 dollars, and I appreciate that. WebOS does lack some features and customization options but it is pretty and runs well. I was able to add a lot of features and make tweaks to the operating system using ""Preware"". I suggest downloading it. You will need to connect your phone to your computer to install it.Overall I am very happy with my purchase. I am using it with T-Mobile. If you set your plan to ""Pay by Megabyte"" you will be able to activate your phone (it requires some data). After that I suggest setting it back to no data.

mobile phone,"AT&T; no contract, no data",MR4569,RS7QVI55JPKWY,3,"I have an AT&T; account, but my contract ran out a long time ago.

This phone pretty much meets my needs, having WiFi and 3G that can be switched off, mp3 capabilities, and an alarm.FOR PEOPLE WITHOUT DATA PLANS ON AT&T;:You are going to need to ask a friend or family member with a data plan to give you a hand. Following the advice of another recent review on this phone, I asked my roommate if I could borrow her SIM card, because she has data. Using the SIM card with data, the phone could activate and get set up, and then I put mine back in and it has been working fine. So this is one way to get around the punitive data plan laws of the smart phone world. Good luck!","January 25, 2012",

mobile phone,Good Cheap Phone for Traveling Abroad,W. Burnham,R3195YJUUXA1HC,3,"I bought this phone to use when traveling in Europe or Asia. Using an unlocked GSM phone allows me to use a local carrier in each country and avoid the ridiculously expensive international data/voice roaming charged by US carriers. At only $55, it can quickly pay for itself vs. international roaming charges.I have used this phone in several countries in Europe without an issue. To use it I just bought a SIM from a local wireless carrier and put some money in my account (usually $20-$30 was enough to get a 500mb-1GB of data and more voice minutes than I could use). In Europe I was able to get HSPA data rates in some places and voice quality was excellent.In the US, I picked up a SIM from T-Mobile and have signed up for the ""daily use"" plan where you pay $5/day but only if you use the phone. This effectively makes the phone a great emergency phone or a good loaner phone for a visitor as you only pay for the day that you use it.The phone itself is a pretty basic smartphone. Palm, the company that made it, is effectively out of business so there is no support available and the software is no longer being updated. That said, it's pretty easy to learn how to use everything and in my experience the phone has been very stable and reliable.I would not recommend this phone as a primary phone for heavy/daily use. It's not that fast and the battery will wear out by the end of the day if you use a lot of data.The positives of this phone:- Very cheap for an unlocked GSM smartphone- Very good email client that syncs email with MS Exchange (mail/contacts/calendar), GMail, Yahoo, etc.- Nice keyboard for inputting texts and emailThe negatives:- You have to activate the phone before using it and that can be a bit of a pain in the neck if you don't already have an account with a GSM carrier (AT&T; or T-Mobile). Make sure to do this before you take it overseas.- The Palm OS has very few apps for it outside of the basic ones. If you require access to mobile apps when you travel, this is not the travel phone for you.- No Google Maps or for that matter any mapping application at all (outside of web browser). This is the one app that would be really nice to have when traveling abroad.","April 16, 2013",
mobile phone,Palm Pixi Nice Phone,Rabbis,R1MOD2XDQT98LY,3,"I bought this phone thinking that it would suite my needs, but I quickly found out that it is really small. The keypad is great for actual keypad lovers/users. The screen is very small as the phone fits in the palm of your hand. I needed smoething bigger after realizing that I had to put my glasses on everytime I looked at my phone and being a person who only uses glasses for reading it was really inconvenient. The touch screen is nice and I liked the option of having a touchscreen and keypad, but too small as I said. I am going to a lrager phone so that I can see my text messages and icons better. The one real downside to this phone is that it does not have the option of not locking the phone, so it would lock every 3 mins which was annoying to me as I utilize my phone often. Also on the downside everytime it locked, when I would get a call the phone would jump back and forth from my bluetooth to normal, really frustrating, I had to keep selecting bluetooth.....:0( Ultimately returned the phone just to many negative variables.","January 22, 2013",

mobile phone,"Great for a Senior, less so for the Elderly","J. Norvell ""peaknorvel""",R1EIE2O4OP8NJN,3,"The SnapFon ezONE-C Senior cell phone is about as simple as the standard model cell phones that you used to buy ten years ago. It is NOT as simple as a landline phone and that made the phone perplexing to the 91 year old woman that I got this for. It is smaller and lighter than I thought it would be, but that could be a plus or minus. The buttons are about the same as a cheap calculator; they are large but you need to press in the center. It has a radio function and a flashlight, which may delight a less elderly person, but I taped over the side switches that operate those with gaffers tape so that they wouldn't confuse. The display is large and clear.The phone works with an AT&T; SIM card. I bought a SIM card on Amazon, but, as it turns out, you must actually buy one from AT&T; anyway or they won't process you to get on their network. The purchased SIM card did allow me to get the phone going earlier however, although it did take repeated phone calls to AT&T; and most of an afternoon to get the phone set up. The phone comes with a SIM card from ""PureTalk"", a reseller of cell phone time, and I presume that setting up with them would be easier.The advantage of a cell phone is that any landline number can be transferred to it. My phone user was being moved into an assisted living facility, just far enough away that she couldn't get a landline with the same number without keeping the old landline and buying a forwarding service -- sheesh. The port to the cell phone went well, but, again, it did take some time on the line with AT&T; folks. I just added her to our family plan and she is saving a lot of money, although you do need to absorb the cost of the phone, the SIM card, and a $40 fee for the new service. She no longer needs the landline at her old home.My elderly user is perplexed that she needs to press down for a period of time to autodial, but she only presses for a short time to hang up. As a result, she keeps turning the phone off, since the ""hang up"" button is also the power on and off button. For seniors that are used to using cell phones previously, this may not be a problem. For a life-long landline user, this is a problem.","October 9, 2011",
mobile phone,"Large buttons are good, it's not simple to use however",dood_up_north,R1JT60GXVLO32B,3,"I purchased one of these and the buttons stopped responding. Amazon promptly refunded me and the second one seems fine. These things happen so this does not affect my review.I also purchased the cheap case ($5) and the cradle. Worthwhile additions.Let me start with the positives. Large buttons. I got this for my step dad and this was the primary reason for the purchase. There is nothing else like it. Sound. The old skool ringer is VERY loud. The speakerphone is fairly loud. The earpiece is unfortunately just so-so volume wise. The mono screen is easy to see and that really helps battery life. You can also have the phone ""speak"" each button you press which can be useful. It's a quad band unlocked GSM phone (no GPRS or data) and you are not stuck with pricey service like Jitterbug. I'm using h2o, an AT&T; MVNO that costs $10 every 90 days (14c a minute airtime). There are lots and lots of options for service depending on user needs. These are the primary reasons for getting the phone and they make it worthwhile.There are two features of the phone that have no business being on this phone. 1. Flashlight. 2. Radio. Those two buttons on the side of the phone could confuse people and get left on by accident. I would have had the volume rockers on the left and the lock on the right. That's it.The SOS button on the back is a good idea but confusing. It took a lot of reading to understand how it works. You program up to four numbers and it sends a SMS and dials each number in order until someone answers. You cannot turn off the SMS.You cannot turn off the annoying start up and shut down tones unless you silence everything (not recommended).The software running the menus is not simple. It would have been nice to disable most of the functionality and remove it from the main menus. That would have made it much easier for a senior to use.The menus are somewhat confusing.

Works in Canada with Rogers.","John Faughnan ""John G Faughnan""",R3I4T121BHNV53,3,"I bought my 83 yo mother the unlocked GSM Snapfon ezONE-C Senior Cell Phone with Big Buttons for about $80 (it's $60 now) along with its car charger (forgetting she doesn't drive any more!). I then carried it to her home in Montreal and activated on a Roger's 40 cent/min (but 0$/day) PayGo plan.My mother likes her Mac Mini and iPad, but she's largely blind, quite arthritic, and has peripheral neuropathy reducing her sense of touch. So most phones won't work for her. This was the only phone we could find that she might be able to use. She needs, for example, to be able to call for help when Montreal's sometimes unreliable wheelchair transport service fails to show up - leaving her stuck in her wheelchair as snow swirls, water freezes, and hungry wolves approach over the ice.It is impressive how few devices are made for people like my mother. I assume the demand isn't there. Certainly if she were younger she might do well with a VoiceOver iPhone, but the combination of age and diminished touch make VoiceOver hard for her. In any case that was my best guess, but the next best choice to this $60 phone is probably a $700 iPhone 5.Based on limited use, here are my impressions of the device. I'll start with the bad, then the good. Bottom line: I think it will work, but I'd rather buy a better version for $100 than the current phone for $60.THE BAD- It doesn't get its time settings off the mobile network. Very weird.- I fear it doesn't persistently store its configuration. I don't want to test this, but I think prolonged removal of the battery will wipe all setup - and setup is a bit painful. File this under ""suspicion"" not proven. Settings do survive a quick battery swap. (Maybe it's storing some data on the SIM card, in which case I might have been confused by a SIM swap.)- This is a very Chinese product -- feels like it was built for the Chinese or Japanese market. That is, it has a number of weird add-on features like an FM radio and a flashlight that mostly add complexity and seem weird for the US market. On the other hand, I think my mother might actually use the FM radio. It uses the ear set as an antenna. In my testing it worked well with an iPhone ear set and with iPod ear buds despite the manual saying only Nokia and SNAPFON earphones work.)- It has too many features that can simply cause confusion and will never be used, like 'conference call' and 'call waiting'. Even SMS is of dubious value. The radio introduces many options.- The power connector is small and hard for my mother to find. I stuck a rubber matt near it so she could find it. It is easily confused with the headphone jack.- It feels fragile and unreliable. We're not talking iPhone 5 build. I'd happily pay $40 more for better build quality.- Display is small and text layout is a bit off. I suspect it was designed to show characters, not Roman letters.- Buttons take some push -- they are cheap!- It comes with ""PureTalk""; it's probably not the best PayGo solution but it's not entirely bad. For the US market I'd suggest H2O Wireless instead.THE GOOD-Big buttons!-Ringer is LOUD, and phone is loud and audible even at an intermediate setting.-The instruction manual is large type.-I could get a camera lanyard into the lanyard hoop with a bit of fiddling (essential accessory, should be bundled with phone).- It speaks numbers as they are entered. Great feature!- Seems to have very long battery life.- The quick dial numbers will work well I think, even though we decided not to enable the SOS feature for now.- Yes, the flashlight and radio are quirky, but my mother might actually come to like them.I created a large print 1 page handout for my mother that included a simplified version of usage directions and the numbers I programmed in for her.","October 12, 2012",
mobile phone,Not completely Happy with it yet,trekker gal,R1X821KAY3L0K2,3,"Purchased for my elderly mother. Seemed like a good idea from the reviews. Unfortunately she is having trouble adjusting to it.Pros:inexpensiveno contract (if you sign up with the service via ezOneLarge touch keypad numbersClear loud voice that says the numbers as she is dialingthe ring and call audio is VERY loudEasy to set up on AT&T; and if you already have a family plan with generous minutes the cost is around 9.99. No internet or texting. Texting is an extra $5locking keypad prevents accidental callsFlashlight comes in handyCons:unable to import phone numbers. We had to manually enter themYou cannot enter multiple numbers to one contact so you have to list a contact for each phone number.Buttons stickshortcut dialing difficult to set up. We still have not been able to do it.the buttons stick which might have somethinng to do with the setup issuesVoice mail not easy to set upradio feature not all that good so she doesn't use itShe doesnt like the phonebook. You can only view one number at a time instead of a list of numbers.The screen with the numbers is small and somewhat difficult to read if you have poor eyesightThe concept is good, which is why I will give it 3 stars. I will update my review in a few weeks to see if she has adjusted to the phone and perhaps will be able to provide a more positive review.UPDATE: had to return this item. The biggest complaint she gave was the phonebook only shows one entry, each entry only had one phone number (where other phones have cell, home etc in one entry). To get to the phonebook is cumbersome for someone with poor eyesight and nimble fingers. The middle menu button which is used to navigate between menu items is impossible to use. No arrows are provided and you have to be careful where you push on it.This phone would be perfect for someone who has no use for the phone book and can manually dial. It is LOUD which is good for those hard of hearing.","December 30, 2011",
mobile phone,"Cheap phone, but works",kmichel,R34JI0SH7R11VO,3,"I purchased the Snapfone for my 93 year old father. It works is about all I can say.Pros:The voice quality is good, and it has quite a loud volume when turned up which is nice for the elderly. The buttons are large and easy to see, and it speaks the numbers as they are pressed. The SOS button on the back is a nice feature. The phone does not come with any sort of service, so it has to be added to a cellular plan - but it is unlocked and will work with any GSM carrier without a contract ( in the USA).Cons:Features like voicemail, texting, and address book are accessed through the arrow buttons. I have found this to be too confusing for a 93 year old. It was easier to teach him to simply press the numbers for the number he wants and ""press the green button."" (or red to hang up). Getting him to understand how to use the voicemail has also been a challenge, so I usually end up having to check it for him. Also, the phone is made quite cheaply.Overall, what you get for the price is good.","October 16, 2013",

Even the ATT staff said they don't have anything as 'clear' and simple as this.He is getting used to it. The only drawback we can see so far is the sound quality is BAD. The first time he called us--I had no idea who was calling - his voice had changed! Sounds like he's talking through a filter.The phone is light and about the size of a deck of cards.

mobile phone,It's Okay. But Not for Everyone...Elderly Included!,"Jamesisit ""Jamesisit""",R100A33QNMYENP,3,"I bought this Phone Specificly for my Aged Father who just went into a Nursing Home. The Phones Size is Smaller than Expected, but the Buttons are Large. The Major Design with this Phone is it's Designed to be a Seniors Phone, but Far Too Many Gadgets were included. The Sliding Buttons on the Side are just plain Stupid! FM radio, LED Flashlight, Phone Button Lock, and Volume all on the Sides where a Seniors Larger Unsteady Hands Slide them by accident Far to Often! I had to Super Glue all but the Volume Buttons to keep My Father from switching something he didn't know he had switched. The Menu Driven Center Rocker between the Call and End Buttons Should have been Better thought out also. A Senior Doesn't understand as easly as we more technologicaly adept persons about pressing menu, then OK the same thing you press to call someone, ""Why I'm not calling anybody yet"" then Menu, ect... And I know the Manufacture means well, but We Need Some way to get Rid of 911 on the Phone Directory Menu. It's the FIRST number that Shows up, and not everybody needs or wants to call 911 all the time. That's what the Emergency Button on the back is for if you want to program it for that. My Dad's situation Never needs 911, and he is in a Nursing home. I hope this Review helps people understand what this Phone Does more indepth than just the Hype on the sights. I would Love it if there were Actually a Senior Phone out there that were actually Just a Phone, sized for Seniors, Without all the Cute Added Features they don't need. They Just Need a Phone to call Family, Friends and keep in touch.Also I bought the Stand to hold the Phone upright and charge it when not in use, thinking it would be easier for Dad just to put the Phone into the little slot and pick it up when it Rang. Wrong! The Little Delicate charger plug pin in the base / phone makes the phone not easly set in the base. Further the base has absolutly No Weight, so when you try to pick up the phone the base comes with it, I even Taped the Base to the Table and that didn't work. When you set the Phone in the Base it can rock pressing buttons in the process. Very Poor Design Again.

My mother is extremely hearing impaired and wears 2 hearing aids. She can only hear voices with the speaker. On snapfon, my she has to answer the phone in the regular way. Since she can't hear on the phone, she has hope her caller can hear her tell them to hold on while she puts them on the speaker, then hold the ZERO button for a few seconds which emits a loud tone that the caller hears before the speaker is engaged. Once connected it is tricky to get the caller's voice to be loud enough without getting reverb.It isn't perfect, but it will certainly work in an emergency and you can't beat the monthly fees.The good points are the numbers are large, it is relatively simple, has a flashlight which we have used and an SOS button.","January 31, 2012",

I received it quikly after purchasing and all that was advertized was in the box. Having set up the phone for my mother, I however have two (2) concerns, the first being that I have not found a way to delete contacts from the phone book on the sim card; secondly reading text messages is difficult as on scrolling the text does not aligne properly in the display.","January 3, 2013",
mobile phone,bought for elderly mother,sittie74,R3KIJWHQR2J4NT,3,"I bought this phone to replace a go-phone my 82 year-old mother had been using for years. Since she is a very active senior citizen, but is hard of hearing, I was looking for something with large numbers,loud volume,and that I could place an existing SIM card in. This phone has all of those features. However,from the SET UP process, thru actual use, I found this phone to be very complicated. It is not easy for her to use since she has to go through several steps just to make a call. For example,in order to find her phonebook listings she has to scroll up to PHONEBOOK, press OK when BROWSE appears on the screen, scroll through her listings, then she must press OK again when DIAL appears on the screen. Also, in order to call her speed dial numbers, she has to hold down the number she wants to speed dial for a longer period of time before it starts to dial that number, otherwise the speaker will just say the number. Then she must press NO and try to speed dial again. While I am pleased with the volume, large buttons and overall size of the phone, I think it is way too complicated for most people, especially older people, not to mention those who are truly elderly.","October 9, 2012",

I am 82 years old and cannot easily operate a flip phone.Since I could not find a flat Doro phone I purchased a large button flat Snapfon phone from Amazon It is ok but not as sophisticatated as the Doro. It is not as easy to use as the Doro phone and the directions for using it are very poor and took me and hour trying to figure how to get all the settings set correctely.Since I could not find another flat phone Doro, the Snapfon phone is really the second best for senior citizens and I do recommend it.","September 11, 2012",

AND...by the way the providers, all of them that workedwith phone do not have good reception inside her apartment so part of her reason for getting a cell phone was lost...ie; falling down far from her land-line. The instructions that came with the phone, while in large print (which was helpful for some folks I am sure) were poorly written in that they left out certain steps critical to the initial set up of the phone.Large buttons are great, but do not make up for the difficulty in certain functional screen menus. Also, the emergency red button function was a joke. Since it was easy to accidentally just hit #1 and then you got an auto dialing of 911...a felony for a false call. The phone turned out to be too large to hang around her neck and too large for herpocket since it seemed to turn its face on, even in the ""locked"" position for the keypad. This bugged my Mom...who declared she ""didn't like it"". She is going to keep it anyway,but our monitoring of her use shows she isn't using it! There is definitely room for improvement.

mobile phone,Nowhere near loud enough unless you put it on speaker (hard for an older person to remember),T. Simmons,R44ETLD1WSAQU,3,"I got this for my dad due to the large numbers and thought the speaking the number option was good so he could hear what # he pressed. But here are my gripes.1) The volume even at max volume was so low I had trouble hearing it unless I put the thing right up to my ear and it was very low then so my dad who's 89 and wears hearing aids would have trouble hearing that in any location that was not particularly quiet.2) The only way to put it on speaker phone is to wait till the call is connected (hopefully you hear them say hello) THEN you have to press the OK button twice in succession. ? There is no menu option to leave it in speaker phone mode and you cannot go into speaker mode until the call is connected. My dad isn't going to remember all of that.3) the back plate was very hard to remove to put the sim card and battery in. If you have strong, sticky hands then maybe you'd fare better than I did4) The FM reception was crap. Basically useless.5) Although not a huge gripe, w/o a flip top, you must press OK to answer and the power button ONCE QUICKLY to hang up and my 89 year old dad isn't going to remember the difference between pressing the power button ONCE QUICKLY and ONCE HOLDING IT. He was 18 in 1945 so none of this stuff is easy and he is pretty much technology ignorant.So, I actually returned it and got the Jitterbug phone which is working much better. Louder, flip top so he only has to open/close to use it (no worry about off/on or accidentally pressing buttons), dedicated speakerphone button that works even BEFORE the call is connected, and although I've had problems getting the ringer to stay on though it could be that it's resetting due to some software flaw or updates, it's working better for my dad than the Snapfon.Just my opinions after actually getting the phone and using it.

mobile phone,Best Virgin Mobile Phone. . . so far,"Jeremy D. ""Jeremy""",R1L6YTWHV3PKMV,3,"I should preface this review by informing you this is my first phone without a physical keyboard--I have always had flip, slider, candy bar, or Blackberry-like telephones with a T9 or Qwerty keyboard on it. Needless to say, using a virtual keyboard takes some getting used to and I do text a lot but also needed a larger screen to view webpages and wanted to give Virgin Mobile a try after some disappointment with larger, more traditional providers.The Good: Virgin Pricing/BusinessVirgin does a great job of being a low-cost mobile carrier that appeals to a wide variety of consumers and utilizes a major network of cell towers (Sprint) that follows large cities and the US Interstate system. Plans for this phone are $35 up to a modest $55/month for everything. Data is unlimited but speed throttling starts at 2.5 GB/plan month (change occured in March 2012). Set-up, number porting, and support is easily done through Virgin's telephone service or website. (Unfortuantely the website does not have chat support, but holds are short or non-existant on their support line.)The Good: Camera/ScreenThis is by far the best camera I have purchased inside a phone. The rear-facing 5MP camera (I have yet to use the flash or front-facing 3MP camera) takes incredibly clear photos and uploads them quickly to Facebook when attached to a 3G or greater data connection. Daylight photos are astounding and it has some type of image stabilization that is the best I've seen in a small lens camera like this. The screen is very clear and I can even read some webpages when they are displayed in a desktop-computer type view. Controls are all on-screen, not sure if the side button can be programmed to act as shutter. Pinch/Expand is quick to respond as well.The Good: Processor and AudioI've used this phone at my office and in my car to stream Pandora digital music and it handles the app and reproduces audio beautifully through it's headphone jack to an aux audio cord for my car stereo or through earbuds. The speakerphone is average and not a good music player but serves its purpose adequately for calls.The Good: DurabilityI've had this phone for a month and while I haven't put it through rigerous paces, it can withstand a short drop (hand to counter) and has a slightly rubberized case for shock-resistance and ease of grip. The surface is Corning Gorilla Glass so it is unlikely it will crack or scratch. The four ports (micro HDMI Out, Micro USB charge/data, and 3.5 mm headphone jack) are uncovered and reasonably simple to keep clean.The Good: AppsThis phone will support almost any app on the Android Market/Google Play, I have yet to come accross one that refuses to install due to incompatibility and Verizon doesn't load on too many that are unnecessary.The Bad: AppsFacebook's App (Ver 1.8.4 for Android) really hates this phone. I've used that version successfully on older phones and it doesn't have critical failures like it does on the Motorola Triumph. No damage to the phone or other applications, but it will close instantly when trying to load Facebook for no visible reason.The Bad: Coverage/WiFi compatibilityI live in a metropolitain area and believed there would be good coverage; unfortunately I am in a brick building and the network Virgin uses is Sprint-only (not their affiliates), so only a few area towers are accessible but this device overcomes that dilemma by using my WiFi network. Unfortunately I can't find a good VOIP application and unlike my old Motorola, this one does not have it installed or I can't locate the mode. The result is I can get quick internet inside my apartment using my WiFi network but when a call is coming, I need to lean out the window--with the weak cellular connection the phone keeps detaching/re-joining my wireless network which is frustrating for sending text messages or using data.The Bad: Something every phone should haveEvery manufacturer who puts a ""flash""/high intensity LED on the back of their phone should keep a ""flashlight"" app/button to give you 15 seconds- a minute of light while dimming the display to make it easy to find things in the dark. I know it drains battery fast--everyone does, but we want this feature!!!The Ugly: As with all smartphones, battery technology hasn't kept up with power-hungry processors and displays and like all phones, this one will not maintain power on standby for a full 24 hours without recharging. Motorola should know we'd gladly carry around a phone 2mm thicker with an extra 2 ounces of weight if it could hold a charge longer than a day!Bottom line: This phone is a good start for Virgin Mobile to carry an Android phone and the price point is appropriate but there are a few improvements needed in this model as well as the Virgin network before it can satisfy customers used to the coverage and handsets offered by traditional cellular carriers.","April 3, 2012",
mobile phone,Good deal for the price.,Codex,R1M4KYEEYIZV2R,3,"I have mixed feelings about the Motorola Triumph. Virgin Mobile's monthly rates are excellent, and have significantly reduced my phone bill after switching from Verizon. Furthermore, porting my old number from Verizon wireless was a very simple process.The Good: The Triumph is a very nice looking phone, it comes with stock Android 2.2 without any modifications by Motorola. The phone feels nice and responsive, apps and screen transitions are definitely more fluid than on my old Moto Droid. The battery life feels adequate, at least in my case. I don't stream a lot of media content, but for standard browsing and app usage, the charge easily lasts a full day. The AC adapter/USB cable is standard Motorola, additional chargers can be found very cheaply online.The Bad: Signal strength is very weak. I typically only get one or two bars. Consequently, upload and download speeds are much slower than what my Motorola Droid was capable of on Verizon's network. Online forums and reviews have led me to believe that this is an issue specific to the Triumph, and not indicative of Virgin Mobile's service. Call quality is acceptable, and I haven't dropped many calls in the month I've had the phone. So, it seems to do that well, even when only showing one bar. Your results may vary. The screen is difficult to see in direct sunlight, even with auto brightness enabled. Light leaks from where the screen meets the body of the phone. Lastly, the phone has been out for several months now, and the problems I've outlined seem to be very common. Motorola hasn't done anything to address or acknowledge the connectivity issues, and frankly, I don't think they intend to at this point.In summary, I would recommend Virgin Mobile as a service, but not the Triumph as a phone. Go with the LG Optimus instead.","December 7, 2011",
mobile phone,A ok Smartphone with a sort of decent battery life,Girl Gamer,R1ZO3WRP2R3K6Z,3,"A great phone. The battery life is GREAT when you do the following steps.TO PRESERVE BATTERY LIFETouch the menu button.Scroll down and click on settings.Scroll down to Accounts and sync settings.If there is a green check next to ""Background data"" click it. After you click it, the check should look gray.With background data on, the phone will automatically receive data (such as weather, news, etc.) and update applications which DRAINS the battery SIGNIFICANTLY. If you use the phone with background data on, you will need to charge within 10 hours (even less if you are a HEAVY user.) I also decreased the brightness on the screen which helped.TO ADD MUSICUse the USB cord add music. Taking out the SD card and using the microSD adapter caused my computer to crash multiple times. So plug in the phone and those errors will cease to exist.This phone is amazing. It's all I've ever wanted. I changed networks from an EXPENSIVE blackberry plan with unlimited texting on AT&T; to a $35 plan for Virgin Mobile. I thought I would have a big problem changing from a trackpad to touchscreen but I didn't. It has a huge screen and with great resolution. Keyboard takes a little getting used to, but it's not a problem.ACTIVATIONStraight forward. It's free because you DIY. I had a hard time, but I realized my trivial mistake. The help line is easy to use. You can keep your old number also.EDIT 5/17/2013I've had my phone for a couple months now and I've noticed some other things about the phone & service-The gallery (photos) can take a long time to load-Indoors, your reception will be HORRID-The green light (for notification) will blink for no reason-The keyboard for texting can be a pain-Use the included charger because if you use something different like the power pad, it won't fully charge.-Has weird glitches , especially during a phone call-Battery sucks , its on %50 after a day of only texting. Add a phone call & the battery is done with .This phone would be good for people who need an upgrade from an older phone , other than that I suggest you choose something different .P.S.

Privacy setting is limited with no option to deselect automatic backup etc. The only thing you can do is do a factory reset, so when I was done using an app (like Google Maps) and I wanted it to stop u/p and d/l from my phone, or just plain stop pinging my location and sending data packages constantly I had to do a factory reset, uninstalling does not work.2. White background flickers/pulses sometimes.3. GPS is rubbish, takes well over 5 mins in a car to get location lock, then a very long time after that to get actual directions.4. Wish I could answer the phone by pressing the power button as opposed to swiping to unlock, but this is true of lots of andriod phones.5. For some reason contacts I key in manually do not stick despite it telling me that the info is saved.6. My computer always has to fix the drive before it can see it upon USB connection.Like:1. Beautiful screen. I love love love the screen size and clarity; it is awesome.2. Clear audio from videos and music playlist.3. It's not a beveled smooth slippery phone, instead it's rectangular and solid with a nice grip.4. Loads web pages pretty quickly on Wi-fi, not so fantastically on 3G since I'm in a bad reception area.5. However, for some reason calls are clear and not spotty.Can't comment on Bluetooth since I never used it.Overall I like the phone, however the screen flicker on both makes me nervous and I wonder how long the phone will continue functioning. I wouldn't mind so much and would totally keep one were it not for the fact that I have to do a factory reset so often.","September 21, 2011",
mobile phone,Motorola Triumph,krstre02,R2UXGYBUQ2MAYR,3,"I've had this phone for 6 months now, before I had the LG Rumor Touch (with virgin mobile also) but wanted a smartphone, the Touch was a ok cell for text and calling but surfing the web forget 'bout it. The Triumph is an ok smartphone for what I need to do. Mostly texting, calling, basic GPS, Apps, and web. I also listen to music on it which isn't to bad, I have a 16gb micro SD card for my phone which helps with space.The negatives are the battery life on the phone sucks, I'm a college student and when i have breaks in between my classes I like to check facebook and etc, etc. But I do have a portable phone charger in my purse when I need it, which was most of the time before I got the battery saver app which helps a little bit. And I also bought a new battery just in case.I don't know if I got lucky and got a defective phone or what but it works for awhile and I'm happy with it than all of the sudden I'm browsing the web or on an app and poof it turns off and starts over on me thta gets pretty annoying if you ask me. Another thing I've just notice is once in awhile the phone will turn off and turn back on, than it is frozen on the Motorola symbol and I have to take the battery out for awhile or replace it with a different battery for it to work, again I'm sure why it does that but for me it does get annoying after the 20th time or so.All in all it is an alright phone for now, I honestly wouldn't recommend this phone to anyone.

I will mostly get a new phone but stick with virgin mobile b/c I'm not paying 200.00 or whatever a month for a contract phone.I like my 25 bucks a month. and even willing to get a new phone and pay the 35 a month, if I can find a half decent phone.","June 8, 2012",

mobile phone,800G won't work in my area,"Amazon Customer ""Cat""",R225E9RD0EP1MK,3,"Other than being it really small (and I have small hands), the phone itself is probably fine. (It's also really slippery--get a rubbery case.) Had to go with 3 stars because of the following:It's hard to talk much about the 800G's features, as I can't get signal on it most of the time, and when I do it's roaming. (Even outdoors I don't always get signal!) Since it's roaming, I can't access the internet/browser, which was kind of the point of getting this model. I spent a lot of time on my home phone with a very helpful Tracfone person today, and she ended up having to send me a different model (LG 505C) as a replacement. The 800G doesn't work where I am without roaming, it seems. And I'm not in a really rural area; the University of South Dakota is just a few blocks away. (There's an ATT tower less than a mile away, though, which is apparently the problem.) I can send and receive calls, just no internet.On the plus side, Tracfone was great about figuring out the problem and sending a replacement, even though it wasn't ordered from their site. On the minus side, it'll take 3-5 days to get here, but since that one is the same price on their site as it is here on Amazon, and was more expensive, I'm okay with waiting. (Tracfone sells the 800G for my zip code on their website, but apparently even it doesn't work in my particular part of my zip code.)

The little english to spanish is a very annoying button also that i accidentally hit many times. Tough screen but it did not align with texting very well. Fingers do not work that well on these tiny keyboard, you need something else. After several months my keyboard went haywire so its done for. It has a nice little camera etc. but I am more of a texting person. Also it is not as user friendly, like other tracfones, as I have had with other companies but for the price it is worth it.

mobile phone,Basic phone only,Myykke,R4DCSNSPKGUEK,3,"Texting on this phone is difficult because the virtual buttons are so small. I often end up not getting the letter I wanted. So, I use the eraser part of a pencil when I have one to use. The calibration trick mentioned in another review didn't seem to make a difference. I can only text with my index finger if I don't have a pencil eraser handy. However, texting is obviously much easier compared to my old flip phone!The sound quality is not great, but acceptable in a quiet environment.It does NOT have any indicator light when you have a text or voice mail waiting for you!

The only drawback to this particular phone is that the face is so sensitive that without realizing, I get connected to sites I don't want and minutes get deducted whether I get on the site or not.

I like all the features the phone has to offer. Although I would like to be able to delete unnecessary sound clips, files, etc, etc, I will never use. The manual is more like a ""quick"" guide than an in-depth tutorial on how to use all the features. For a poor man's touch screen phone, it's not a bad little gadget.

It will display some good online websites, such as Weather Underground weather radar. The triple minutes are GREAT. Online time is metered generously, you won't use much while browsing.

mobile phone,It's barely acceptable,M. K.,R3PDUX52PN9Z7R,3,"This is my 2.5 star review, based on my impression that each Pro is equally balanced by a Con and therefore this is a middle of the road product.I bought this for my MIL. It was one of the few Tracfone options which came with triple lifetime minutes, which I needed to make her budget work.It's hard for her to use. Scrolling through the address book (even one with only a few dozen entries) is exceptionally difficult, and slow. We bought a stylus and that helped, a little.The screen locks immediately during a call. This is a feature to prevent the touch screen from registering any action while a call is in progress. This includes calls to voicemail, which require you to.... press the virtual number pad (on the screen) to perform various messaging actions. So the end result is an awkward dance of holding the phone to your ear to hear the voice prompts and then pulling it away to unlock the screen to show the dialpad to press the number, all before you run out of time.There are a few 'screen lock' options and being a technical person I tried them all. None of the options prevent the screen lock.On the positive side, you can place and receive calls, so it does perform the basic function of a phone.This is likely a reasonable phone for someone who is moderately technically savvy. I would not recommend it for situations like mine-- an older relative who is not in touch with technology.","June 26, 2013",

mobile phone,Best option out there for an Android phone on Sprint!,dt2008,R1ZVRMA6JQUNNI,3,"I got my Galaxy S II Epic Touch 4G (longest and completely unnecessary product name...ever) at the Sprint store, but the phone will be the same if you order it from Amazon or Sprint (though you can save $50 through Amazon, because upgrading or purchasing new with 2-yr agreement with Sprint, the phone rings in at $199.99 as of December 4, 2011). A Sprint told me I would have to pay a $35 activation fee for upgrading my phone (this is after he had already swiped my card, he didn't tell me this before, but that's neither here nor there).Positives:1. The phone's screen is HUGE. It's beautiful. The color can be vibrant or soft depending on the settings which you can tweak a variety of ways.2. It's extremely snappy! No lagging in most of the apps that I use (Kindle, Fandango, Movies, Chase Bank, YouTube, Gmail, Facebook, SoundHound).3. You get a cool notice with how much percentage EXACTLY is left on your battery charge, and then when the battery is done charging, you get a notice to unplug the phone. This is good for the battery, and I like the latter notice.4. Samsung was smart and gave the back of the phone a little bit of a grip, and this makes me feel MUCH safer pulling this phone out of my pocket!! It's so thin and lightweight that you really can forget you even have it on you!5. The photos taken with the flash come out looking better than most cheap sensor-having digital cameras. Really no point to have a $80 Point-and-Shoot anymore, just use your cellphone. If you need a better camera, I would get one for sensors and the zooming lens, otherwise this is fine (and I have 2 cameras!).6. Vlingo Voice is a great addition to Voice Commands! It understands 95% of what I say. Once I get a phone holder for my car, I can safely get directions, receive notifications or send quick text messages/calls. Vlingo and Google work seamlessly on this phone to help you search the web or your phone.Negatives:1. The Audio Jack doesn't work with the 3.5mm auxiliary cable from Monster that works with my old HTC Sprint Hero and iPod nano. The phone's Audio Jack is at a slight angle, so there isn't a true connection for the metal. If I hold onto the jack, the stereo in my car can somewhat pick up the sound and it hollowly echoes in my car speakers. This is awful. I need to find a new cord (extra money out of my pocket) or jack adapter just to listen to Amazon MP3 from this phone. The speakers are also not that great for watching movies, so I would suggest using earbuds, but make sure the jack fits! On the plus side, it fits with my cheapo Memorex earbuds (which, granted, have a slightly thinner jack area than the Monster cable).2. The battery seems to be doing okay, considering I have the screen shut off at about 5 seconds of no use in the ""Home"" screen. This is not my preference. In the actual ""phone/wallpaper/apps"" area, if I don't use the phone for 15 seconds, the screen goes black. I have the setting at 30 seconds, but it fades at 5 and then turns off at 15 seconds. I need to tweak this more.3. Android Gingerbread still doesn't have the full features of Gmail. You cannot ""filter messages like this"" anywhere inside of Gmail, you must manually label each e-mail is my understanding. Well, at least the lables are color-coded like they are in the web version of Gmail, right?4. I am not sure if the battery icon is accurate enough in pixels. When I first bought the phone, it had a slight charge good enough for about 2 hours before I got a low battery notice. OK, that makes sense, but I couldn't understand why the green battery icon showed more than 50% full.5. Adding application widgets to a screen isn't intuitive. If you want just the icon, you need to go into the Applications screen and hold it down until it allows you to drag it to a home screen. If you want the application's widget (example: YouTube widget vs icon), you need to go to the Menu -> Add -> Widget feature. Google needs to cleanup that OS feature, because it makes no sense to anyone.6. The OS doesn't automatically capitalize proper pronouns or names, which drives me absolutely crazy. Even my HTC Hero which wasn't on Gingerbread knew the difference between Japan and japan!!!!7. Cheap and shorter than a hooker's mini-skirt USB charging cord. I've already ordered a replacement/back-up cord because the included one is LAUGHABLE.Conclusion:This phone is the best choice for Android on Sprint. The size of the phone is large, but you really are just at the sweet spot before ridiculously too small for reading and too large for pocketing. I wear women's skinny jeans and this phone slipped beautifully into my back pocket! Also, new women's handbags are making wider mouthed mobile slots, so you can easily get this in there. I picked up a white iPhone to compare the screen and weight, and the iPhone 4S was HEAVY and thick compared to this beauty! The Samsung Galaxy S II has elegantly flushed side volume and power buttons, so you really don't have any strange protrusions like with the iPhone 4S in my opinion. Most of my complaints about this phone stem from the Google Android OS Gingerbread, not the hardware, so take that into consideration.","December 3, 2011",
mobile phone,"If you value GPS, avoid this phone like the plague!",Jen,R2MCLE14VEUPMZ,3,"In many ways I love this phone. It's got a gorgeous screen, ample storage space, great camera, and very responsive. However there are two glaring issues that I'm having a hard time getting past.Signal strength - coming from an Evo I'm used to pretty good signal. The Epic Touch 4g has 1 bar or no signal in the exact same places. It's annoying but not a dealbreaker since I can still get enough signal to make and receive calls most places.GPS - horrible horrible. You can use the GPS but if you turn it off and back on, you'll have to restart the phone to get a location lock. Even with apps to clear the GPS cache, I still have to power off and on if I want to use the GPS. Even then, you better be outside when doing it, and it will still be slow. With Beautiful Widgets I very often get ""invalid location"" whether I've got it set for wireless network or GPS. That's not due to an update in the app., it only started happening when I bought the Epic Touch 4g. For someone who travels often, the GPS is a complete nightmare.If you don't have need for GPS, the phone is a good option if you are in a WiMax area since Sprint will likely make those the last places to get LTE, but if you value your GPS like I do - you will want to choose a different phone.","May 17, 2012",
mobile phone,"Have 4 SII's on a family plan, phones working better with new software!",Mike840,R3S14JE453KJ4P,3,"I originally had our 4 SII phones rated with a 1 star, but I'm updating this review because we found a Sprint store that was able to help us out. We were having a lot of problems with our 4 SII phones, but had a software update installed and the phones are now working great.Before the upgrade, the phones would lock up, turn on and off by themselves and have poor battery life. With the new software upgrade, the phones are working as one would expect.Also, Sprint's phone service seems to be getting better as well. The coverage was somewhat spotty when we first moved to central FL, about a year ago, but now it seems better and we have fewer dropped calls. Family members recently visited relatives in northern Wisconsin and they had much better coverage with their Sprint phones than family members that had service with other carriers.Bottom line, Samsung Galaxy SII phones from Sprint are good phones, but go with the S4. It's the best phone on the market (including the I-Phone).","June 8, 2013",
mobile phone,Performs well IF you get 4G now,Amazon Customer,R3450GU05XOR19,3,"I got this phone to replace my aging Palm Pre. Being a frugal person, I wanted to stay with Sprint because I had a grandfathered SERO derivative plan called SERO Premium ($50 plus tax per month for 450 voice min, unlimited text and unlimited data).The phone absolutely kicked butt when I used it at my home office via WIFI (I have FIOS 25/25 service). Speedtest.net averaged around 5 mbps down and 6 mbps up.Unfortunately, its a whole different story when using it on the road where Speedtest.net averaged around 600 kbps down and 500 kbps up in Central NJ.There are no existing 4G towers so I am defaulting to 3G which pretty much cripples the phone.To boot, Sprint STOPPED rolling out 4G WiMax towers and will instead be rolling out 4G LTE towers during 2nd half of 2012 and into 2013.Although they are both labeled 4G, these are two distinct technologies and my current Samsung Galaxy SII Epic Touch is ONLY ABLE to operate under 4G WiMax.So what does that mean for me? Since there is no existing 4G WiMax service where I live now, and any new 4G LTE will not be compatible with my shiny new phone, I would be using it EXCLUSIVELY as a 3G phone for the life of the contract (2 years).It would be nice if Sprint employee informed me of this when I purchased it, don't you think? Well, I decided to return this phone (within 14 days and eat the $36 activation fee) and will be porting out to Verizon Wireless where they have extensive 4G LTE coverage in my area.So, if you currently can receive 4G WiMax signals where you live, by all means upgrade to this phone. The phone itself is awesome and you won't regret it.But, if you are like me living in a 3G area only, forget the upgrade and wait until Sprint starts rolling out LTE compatible devices (projected to be 2nd half) but with Sprint/Lightsquared fiasco going on now, I would seriously consider porting out.","January 27, 2012",

mobile phone,Great phone besides non-functional GPS,Kannon30,R2DPA1P4XW1XMZ,3,"I bought this phone about three months ago, after upgrading from an HTC Evo 4G device. My Evo's GPS was awesome. It would pick up very quickly and I had no issues with it. This phone has a completely unusable GPS signal. I've tried looking for fixes, but they all involve flashing third party ROMs on it (not too easy to do for the regular joe who isn't on top of technology).Pros:-Very slim. Pop this thing in your jeans and hardly anyone will know.-Cheap accesories. As it uses standard cabling, you can buy cheap knock-off accessories and they work fine.-Big, vibrant screen-Feel in the hand (I know this is subjective, but it feels really good in the hand)Cons:-Battery has gotten a bit ""meh"" after 3 months. I can get through about 8 hours without charging it. This involves no video watching, only streaming podcasts (~ 1 hour) and push email on.-The worst GPS I have ever seen. I could be in the middle of the city without a cloud in the sky and it would take me anywhere from 10-20 minutes to get a GPS positioning. Even when it's on, it'll say I'm in the wrong part of town, sometimes even 8-10 miles away.

Now that was comparable to my T-Mobile and so I figured that my taxes and surcharges would be about the same and my monthly bill would be about $85.00... then I get the bill and am shocked at 97.00 and that's not even including the device protection plan which I was suppose to be signed up for but they didn't.I called them thinking it must be a mistake or error on their part and much to my dismay find out that besides having less service area (I knew that when I joined with Sprint) I am now paying as much as if I would have joined Verizon or At&t.;So, since I got the phone for a penny on Black Friday, I am debating on whether to pay the $300 cancellation fee (still less than the cost of the phone) and switch back to T-mobile.

mobile phone,Samsung Galaxy SII-A bit much technology for the average user,"M. Reynard ""kairosdreaming""",R27XXM11PUWH7K,3,"So this was my first data phone ever. And part of my decision to get this phone was because it was so pretty and sleek. And if that doesn't clue you in to how proficient I am with cell phones, this will; I am not very up to date on cell phones, so this review will be from a slightly below average user of a cell phone (and there are surprisingly many of us with the same affliction). I sadly lost my 5 Year old Cherry Chocolate when the charging slot broke. It was a very tragic day for me. I'll come clean and say that I've never really seen the need for a data phone. All I do is talk generally on a cell phone, and very rarely text (as I can't stand texting, it seems so inefficient to me) and since I never had data I didn't know what I was missing. But hey, when I switched providers I was offered an unlimited plan to go along with this modern data phone so I could text, talk, and surf all I wanted. So I figured it was time to break down and enter the world of technology that all you young whippersnappers are in. I'm still not sure how I like it, but I learn a little more every day. For reference through this review, my current provider is T-Mobile with the 4G service.Operation:The Galaxy S II is a touch screen phone. Its main screen is used to swipe, tap, etc. all the features that are available. This screen can be viewed horizontally and vertically by how you hold your phone. There are also four buttons at the bottom for contacts, home, back, and search that are used by tapping the associated pictures. There are a couple regular buttons on the side of the phone, and these are used for volume control, and power. The two ports on the phone are one for your charger/computer hookup area (yes I realize I am a technical vocabulary master) and an area for a headphone type plug. A quick note on the charger, it is also the cord to hook the phone to a computer as well, it just involves unplugging from the ""head"" and using the extension. So it serves two purposes which is great!The actual length of the phone holding a charge is more disappointing though. I take the phone off the charger in the morning before I leave for work, and by the time I leave work its almost dead. And I don't use the phone while at work. All the battery sucking applications are turned off and I don't have a bright screen, so I'm not sure what phantom is taking all my power, but something is making it not hold a charge very well. But I suspect that's the way of these phones.There are four main screens that can be reached by swiping across the screen. The home page has applications like the camera, and any other applications you may place there. Another screen is blank and used for whatever you want. Another holds weather and news, and the last monitors your open applications and usages. Getting to any of theses screens is easy to do. Pressing your finger down on any of these screens for an extended period of time allows you to push back the screen to an ""edit"" area where you can alter the icons or access widgets, folders, shortcuts, and wallpapers.The bar area at the top of the screen monitors what your phone is doing. Here you can find the time, any open applications like the alarm that are currently running, battery power, service level and notifications. To access the notifications you use your finger to drag the bar down and then have access to some shortcut buttons that allow you to quickly turn on/off the Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, GPS, SilentMode, and AutoRotation features. You can also install updates from this screen, access visual and regular voicemail quickly, and see your downloads.The speakers are decent on this phone. While headphones would probably be better, it can get pretty loud with a regular ring tone (if you don't use the vibrate feature). Playing music on it is very doable though and you can hear the words clearly and the music doesn't sound distorted. It does tend to be a little softer as far as volume goes when talking to people or playing music as opposed to the ringtones, someone hard of hearing might have some trouble with the volume.I'm sure there's a lot more to do with the operations of this phone that I haven't even discovered yet, but as a partial luddite, I'm unlikely to discover them very quickly if ever. So this review is more coming from a casual technology user, and hey, there's plenty of us out there. So don't feel bad if you don't know all the bells and whistles on your phone.Talk:This phone is kind of average for talking for me. My biggest complaint is that this phone is incredibly hard to hold between the shoulder and head because of its slim sleek design. Normally this thinness would be a plus, but as I lack a bluetooth it makes it incredibly tough to do anything else while talking on the phone. Not to mention I haven't been able to master holding the phone in one hand while manipulating it with the same hand, I have to use both hands. Which may seem like a petty complaint but efficiency is everything for me. And since I use the phone for talking mostly, it has to be one that I feel comfortable using. I'm adjusting, but its slow going.The volume always seems to be good while talking. I have no problems hearing anybody I talk to, and I'm told that they don't have any problems hearing me. So the audio seems to have good input and output despite the speaker areas being miniscule.The software that goes along with making calls is interesting. There is no quick dial on this phone. Or at least no the quick dial I was used to with the older models. This phone requires you swiping to get in, and from there a couple of button pushes to make a call to the person you want. And this is even with me having a shortcut to the contact on the main face of the phone. Compared to the quick call on older phones where you pressed a button and then send its a complicated system. Not a good phone for dialing while driving, not that you should talk and drive at the same time without a bluetooth. And that is my safety warning for the day.One neat feature about the calling is that phone numbers located in texts and web pages can automatically be called by holding your finger down over the number. It will give you the option to call from there. So incredibly handy when you don't have a pen to write down the number with when searching.Text:Surprisingly, since I'm not a big fan of texting, I actually don't mind texting with this phone. The small touch pad keyboard takes some getting used to with big clunky fingers, but once you do it is much more efficient than pressing the same button four times just to get the letter ""s"". I'd say I text much more than I used to because of this feature.Another great feature is the fact that the text retains the history of texts. So you can tell what you've said before without flipping through numerous screens. Its just a matter of scrolling up or down with your finger. I also enjoy that you can insert pictures and videos directly into this text ""chat"" itself as well.There are several shortcuts to the texting, such as the Swype feature when turned on that lets you just drag your finger from button to button, and the quick words that appear at the top of the keyboard where the phone tries to guess which word you may be spelling and offers you a quick button to use instead.Data:This is the feature of the phone that I didn't expect to really use. And I was partially right in that assumption. Perhaps its just my provider, but I usually only get a good connection to the internet when I'm driving in my car (which means I am NOT surfing the internet) or standing out in the middle of my street, which is also not very safe. I don't get any signal inside my home. The techs said this was ok though because I could just use my wireless connection for my internet there. Sadly, this proves to not be the greatest either, even when I'm sitting five feet away from the wireless router. So I guess I'm just not meant to enjoy my internet.When I do get access it is very slow to bring up pages and sometimes will spin forever until I give up. Most pages that I do access have to be expanded on in order to read anything as well, so scrolling is sometimes interesting as well. But it is handy in a pinch when I need to look something up or check the price for certain items that I'm considering buying. I'll even check my email once in awhile. Supposedly I should have fun streaming music and video on this phone too, but I haven't even attempted it since regular pages have issues.Camera:I love the camera on this phone. Its quite possibly my favorite part of the phone. Great picture, extremely good clarity, and it takes pictures out of both sides so you can use it for a self portrait (which honestly the clarity is so good that I don't do that because it makes me look terrible, every flaw revealed). Zooming is done by the same method you use to expand or shrink other screens. And it holds quite a few pictures because of the storage space. The video is exceptional as well but it does take quite a bit more room on the storage.I've actually taken to just taking my phone when going on trips as opposed to my Nikon because its smaller and the pictures are almost as good. And that really says a lot since I like my Nikon. And like a regular camera, this phone can take pictures in different formats from black and white to sepia, the resolutions can be adjusted, delays can be set, and many other standard camera features can be achieved with it.Applications:I've only downloaded a few applications, but I do enjoy the Angry Birds and the few Restaurant locators I've managed to nab for free. And there are so many different applications that I'm sure there's something out there for everyone. And unlike the internet, the applications usually run at a decent speed.GPS:Since the signal works ok with driving I've had some success with the GPS feature on the phone. It hasn't gotten me lost anyway and the voice is clear and easy to understand. The features that allow you to search for your locations are easy to use and you can have it pick a destination for you by searching for different restaurants, or you can type the address in manually. Another neat feature is that the GPS can be used automatically when browsing the internet. If you find an address on the page, simply hold your finger down on it and it will offer the GPS option to that address.Alarm:Ok, this is probably a weird thing to comment on. But I really like the alarm that is featured on this phone. I haven't used a regular alarm in years, and this one pulls out all the stops. You can adjust volume, what days, frequency, music, and just about anything you can think of on it. And you can set multiple alarms at the same time. Its very convenient and I use it everyday.Overall this isn't a bad phone at all. I wish the battery stayed charged longer, but it has some interesting features. I also would love for the calling options to be easier but since texing is easier maybe I'll start using that feature more. I think that a more tech savvy person might enjoy it more than I have. For an average user this phone may offer a little too much to wrap your head around. I certainly don't use it to its full extent but I haven't felt the need to either. I can't say that if I could go back and buy a different phone then I wouldn't, but now that I have this one I'll probably keep it for a few years as I'm in no hurry to replace it with anything else. It's definitely been a very informative phone for entering the world of data in.Review by M. Reynard 2012","March 14, 2012",
mobile phone,Change,Keri,R1G0IKC3Z0TKY1,3,"This phone was a big change for me, I really wanted to stick with HTC but I don't want or need 3d, so after being on the fence I just took the plung.My first thoughts are these:Con's1 even though it loaded my contacts from Gmail (which i joined in Gmail) it separated every last one of them. Meaning that the contacts that have more than one phone numbers, email addresses, regular addresses etc are all separate. Even though it looks like I can join each one manually it should have loaded them they way they are in Gmail.2 the touch screen seems a bit wonky, I choose the pattern as security but no matter where my finger was tracing the phone when the opposite way. I disabled security for that reason. I have the same issue with the keyboard, as well as on occasion especially when the phone is charging when I try to type it acts like crazy and letters from the opposite side of the keyboard are chosen.3 the little vibration when you touch the screen is a bit delayed. Not as nice or as smooth as the EVO 4G.4. One more Keyboard complaint. I got very use to the HTC Keyboard with had little arrows at the bottom to move the cursor around, they must be exclusive to HTC.5. The last thing I didn't know but is that each Android phone apparently is not universal so if you have an app that you absolutly can not live with out like say HULU then check before you buy because some of my fav apps have to be remade or programmed different for the Samsung.6. no dual antennae. Seriously not cool, in a cutting edge phone.Pro's1. Very light. Amazing how light it is. Slim very comfortable to hold.2. Call quality is great on my end, and I haven't had any complaints from the callers either.3. Fast boot up.4. Signal strength is good.5. Programs start up quickly, no force closes, or freezes yet.6. Speaker is very loud, I am very surprised by this since the opening seems so small.7. The camera is great. Starts up quickly, takes fabulous pictures with very little delay. The HTC EVO had a 3 second delay before it would take a picture sometimes more, I am happy to report the delay is a second or less.Over all I like this phone a lot. I would give it more stars, and I may after I play with it some more, there are a ton of bells and whistles to toot and jingle :)","November 5, 2011",
mobile phone,Customer service not so great,James D. Denson,RSGAI0JMXCRWN,3,"Prior to purchasing a Samsung phone, I suggest you try and reach the Samsung customer service department.I had a problem with my phone Verizon could not resolve. I called the Samsung ""Customer Service"" department for 3 days, multiple times and was never able to talk to an actual person. One of the most frustrating phone loop systems I've ever encountered.If you feel customer service may be of value to you in the future, check it out before you purchase their products.An over acceptable product but their customer service SUCKS!","September 4, 2012",
mobile phone,Just ok,Hellskitten,R2MCUXDDO2QIB2,3,"The new SGE4gII is great if you only want a camera or texting phone. But if you rely on an actual phone to make calls this is not the phone for you. I returned this phone within 8hrs had to charge it to make sure that was not the issue. Replaced with Photon best talking phone for smartphones. service almost everywhere. country living causes issues sometimes. Like I said it is a great camera but I needed something as a phone since I have no other service to rely on at home and the PHOTON won. Epic II has beautiful colors and so many things to do with them but we don't live in the city or in 4g area so not for us. Chicagoland area outside 4g area, Northern Indiana. Good Luck and enjoy you new phone. Also when had service it was not loud enough to hear on but speaker volume for radio was nice.","January 20, 2012",
mobile phone,Voice Talk may be a dealbreaker....,Enzo,R1D2HN7QPMMXFY,3,"I just bought two of these phones for myself and my wife. We just came from Evo's which we loved.I love everything about the GSG2 except for two main things...The generic dialer that comes with the phone is awful. You have to toggle between contacts and logs to see history whereas on the old Evo i could see recent calls and the keypad in the same window. Possible Solve for this: Download ExDialer - excellent app, only flaw with that app is you can't erase missed calls, it keeps adding them up and you'll have 100 missed calls displaying in notification and have to ""clear"" it every time.MOST IMPORTANT PROBLEM FOR ME: Samsung's partnership with VLINGO. On the HTC I was used to hitting my talk button on Pro Voyager bluetooth and saying ""Call Michele"" and it called my wife every time. With this new software it goes through Vlingo and you CAN NOT use an alternate application (whole purpose of Android). I've tried saying Michele and it doesn't recognize the name and says the contact does not exist. I have been searching the web for hours to a resolution to this and you'll find there is none at this point and Samsung and Vlingo are not speaking about it.Buyer Beware - I wish the HTC One X (Spring will cal it HTC Jet) came out now so I can return this phone for an HTC....Not sure what to do now. If I return this there's nothing else good available in my opinion (even the Nexus Prime isn't out yet)","March 27, 2012",

I contacted my provider, we tried troubleshooting, different configurations, etc, nothing worked. I went to the store, the SIM card was changed, it still did not work. Since it was unlocked I had to contact the manufacturer. Because it is an international version, Samsung US said they could not fix or repair. I emailed Samsung UK and they said that because I was located outside the EU I should look for a local repair center. I finally went back to Amazon and they had the best customer care service and I returned to the seller for a refund.

mobile phone,Beware,Roland,R2S6DS9HAQCCZ0,3,"Give it three stars cause of delivery was on time and packaging was ok, could of been a smaller box doh. But beware cause the Samsung Galaxy S III/S3 GT-I9300 Factory Unlocked Phone - International Version is not unlock. To use any other sim in is totally not possible cause it is region lock to the UK. A note from Samsung Germany that the Note 3 along side some other Samsung phones is region locked only until activation. Once activated in the European market on a European carrier the lock is removed and users can use the phones without any restrictions but nopes that ainâ€™t the truth peeps. The region lock has appeared on newer versions of Samsung Galaxy S4 and S4 mini also so I just want you guys to be aware with this factory unlock stupidness with Samsung phones. The phone would only ask for Sim Network Unlock Pin, note that this is the region lock and not your actual sim card pin, if enter too many wrong numbers you are looking for more trouble with the phone. I give it three stars also cause I had to pay $50US for it to get unlock which was nearly impossible to unlock, after unlocking the phone the phone works great. It Is a really cool phone to have.

I tried everything and looked on the web to correct the issue or work around it. No luck. Without such connection it is difficult to load any music on the phone.

mobile phone,First time smart phone user,"K. Sutton ""x_incinerate_x""",R1P7U06PA0PW1M,3,"So I've had this phone for about 4 months now. It is the first smart phone I have had, I haven't even figured out how to do the touch sharing thing that they advertise the phone with. It's a pretty awesome phone but it does have some problemsFirst off, the screen freezes. It doesn't happen very often, maybe once a month since I've owned it. I don't know if that is something that happens with all smart phones, but apparently, it needs to be restarted every once in awhile. It doesn't seem to make a difference if I have the phone off for a few hours every day, since I turn it off while I'm at work or in class. I've talked to other s3 owners and the same thing happens to them as well.I don't know if this is the phone or the provider (T-Mobile) but sometimes my phone won't receive service. This happens more often than the screen freezing, restarting the device seems to fix this problem as well-which leads me to believe that it's more the phone than the provider. This one annoys me more than the screen freezing because I've missed several important calls due to this problem. Technology is making it possible to do all kinds of amazing things, but we shouldn't be moving backwards. A phone should still have the ability to make and receive phone calls.They break REALLY easy. Mine hasn't broken but I have a cover and screen protector on it. I have two friends with s3s that they were using without covers and both of them have cracked the screen. One of them cracked while it was in my friend's pocket. He doesn't know how it happened. So if you're going to buy this phone, I strongly recommend a cover and screen protector.Overall, I like the phone and what it is capable of doing but with that kind of drawbacks, I think I'd rather go back to having a simple phone.","December 9, 2012",

mobile phone,Awesome phone...EXCEPT,nanijian,R334ZZY8ITP0VZ,3,"This truly is a great device, but sadly I've received one that has the cellular problem.When making incoming or outgoing calls the phone will connect, but no sound is heard on either end. And if left connected for about 10 seconds the call will drop and I will loose connection from the cellular network for a min.I've searched high and low for a solution.. I've tried god knows how many different roms.. I've changed basebands.. factory reset, but no avail... the problem persists.Im certain that it's a hardware problem because if you tap the back of the phone you can sometimes hear the audio cutting in and out.From what I've read online the only solution is to send it back to Samsung, and apparently they change the motherboard... but thats a bit difficult in my situation as I live in the Cayman islands.Other than that pesky problem I love my s3.","September 13, 2012",

I will first tell you about the phone. Mid range device with huge marketplace of apps waiting to download on it. I'm pleased with the look and feel of this one, handy and comfortable to carry out in your pocket without no one notice at all, and sometimes even yourself. On the other hand, sometimes Android gets laggy and clumsy with some commands, taking a few seconds to respond my demands and I realized that my windows phone managed performance in a better shape than this S3. Another issue with this device, and the most difficult one, is that although in the title of the publication said the device came unlocked turns out it wasn't, and at this point is when my nightmare begins. I purchased from a different seller than amazon with apparently good rates and reviews but the customer service until now it has been deficient and I must say I'm very upset about their treatment with my complain about my S3 locked issue. They told me that Samsung are shipping devices unlocked since 5 months ago only for using under European and North American soil and it wont work properly with carriers from Latin America, Africa or Asia. I use to travel a lot because my job requires it and I wanted to try some new different and taste what everybody told me about the marvelous world of android but I couldn't do it because of this matter. Therefore, and with a great effort, I made a deal with this seller and they will pay the rooting process in order to unlock the cellphone to all regions.

I just really liked it and wanted to keep it.However, I couldn't keep it.

Yes, I checked the apps, yes I installed managers, yest I checked syncing and GPS and wifi, etc. Configured with even less functionality than Razr Maxx. And I hadnt even installed most apps yet (Soundhound, Cardscan, etc) .Alas, keeping it plugged in all day is not an option for me - so I returned it to Verizon for the Droid Razr Maxx HD.

mobile phone,I should have bought an iPhone,J. Jun,R2HL2SULT6COIG,3,"The camera quality is breathtaking. Too bad I can't share them with my friends.It's impossible to upload pictures to Facebook. Uploads fail 90% of the time, especially if I try tagging friends, adding a location, or posting to an album instead of to my own wall.I even tried using Bluetooth to transfer photos to my laptop so that I can upload them from my computer, but Bluetooth doesn't work at all. I can't even transfer photos through Bluetooth to other users.I have to plug my phone into my laptop with a USB cable if I want any chance of sharing photos.The texting application is embarrassingly undeveloped. Until recently, I couldn't even receive group texts from non-Android users. I could send out a text to multiple people at once, but the responses would come back in separate texts. When I try sending more than one photo in a message, the texting app compresses it into a slideshow that non-Android users cannot open. Likewise, when non-Android users send me more than one photo in a message, I have to open the slideshow but cannot zoom in while it is playing. I have to download each individual frame and THEN open it.I was looking forward to the Galaxy S3, since my tech savvy friends were touting its customizability as a benefit that trumps the iPhone's convenience, but I should have gone for convenience.","April 29, 2013",
mobile phone,Great phone but glass is fragile,JN,R1JJH4WYO8YCCO,3,"Ordered the phone on Friday and it arrived on Monday. I had to wait until Wednesday for the mini to micro SIM cutter to arrive before I was able to use the phone on T-mobile network. I have purchased Apple phones since iPhone 3G was introduced but changed to Samsung Android phone last year. I have purchased both Palm products and various Windows mobile variants prior to Apple OS. I have purchased at least one, sometimes 2 phones every year since the early 90's both in USA and Japan. I have purchased 8 smart phones since 2006. This is the first time purchasing a mobile phone from Amazon.Pros:I agree with most of the posted positive reviews so I will not repeat the great features of this phone.Cons:1. Data speed on T-mobile network is EDGE, same speed as iPhone 2G (2.5G technology; 200 kbps download and 100 kbps upload). If I use Samsung phones sold in USA by T-mobile I can get >8 mbps download and >1 mbps upload at same locations.2. Gorilla Glass 2 easily cracks. I have multiple cracks across the entire screen after dropping the phone from approximately 3 feet, less than a week old. Touch screen and LCD is working fine but I must deal with very visible cracks. Unfortunately the glass is fused to the display, and the display to the Galaxy S III's frame. I must purchase the entire display module including the glass, LCD, backlight, touch screen and the metal frame. The cost of this module is $300 plus shipping. I have dropped my previous phones many times (iPhones and smaller size Samsung phone) and never damaged the screen in the past. I may consider paying $7-$11 per month for insurance even with a $200 deductible for my next phone. I will most likely purchase a new phone from Amazon with a contract (Less than $150) and use my international unlocked phone with many cracks when I travel outside USA.3. Japanese language support still requires loading an application. Apple OS supported Japanese and other languages since its introduction. Single button in all applications to change language.

mobile phone,Screen broke after first fall from 3 feet high,"Mike ""Mike""",R16L1L0F1NAB8K,3,"Review from Mike's Wife:I've had this phone for 6 weeks and wish I had gone with the Motorolla. Eveyone I talked to said that this phone had the next best camera to the iPhone and that is pretty much the only reason that I didn't go with the Motorolla Droid Maxx HD (which does have gorilla glass).What I do like about this phone: the talk to text for text messaging and email is awesome! You dictate the message, including the punctuation, which has saved me so much time. The swipe to type is okay but not great (the talk to text is better). The camera and videos are nice. The phone is fast and has a nice, large screen.Now, for what I don't like: the screen broke from a fall of only 3 feet!! I practically threw my old Motorola Droid (first edition) and dropped it from multiple heights onto tile, concrete and macadam and the screen NEVER broke or scratched! My Husband has the Droid three and same story, dropped many times without problems. I also don't like that this phone doesn't always auto rotate. When I have it in the car mount, the home screen does not orient to horizontal but most of the apps will when they are open. The phone doesn't have a ""driving mode"" like the Motorola and does not ""play"" as well with all the Google functions as my old phone. when you are in the text mode, if you turn the phone horizontally you can barely see the a single line of the text message that you are trying to replay to. The email app that comes on the phone, sucks and even the wireless guy said ""don't bother"". I use the yahoo and gmail apps instead.If you get this phone be sure to get insurance on it from day one.","April 15, 2013",

mobile phone,Not senior friendly!,nelson,R1JQZX26WPZPY7,3,"I bought this item for my mother who is now in late 50s. She wanted a smartphone so I got her something that had a good review with reasonable price and big screen size for her bad sight. As I was using it, it was very complicated since access to the setting was not so friendly. For Android, you do not have access to most of the applications through device's setting, but you have to go to its own setting to control it. Also, for this device, you have to touch-and-drag to open the phone. To parents like mine have little knowledge or sense for that. It took her 3 days to figure out. Now she thinks you have to touch-and-drag all the applications to open it. She will take a long time to get used to this phone.Maybe this phone is for more young, new generation who know how to use touch screen properly. Do not recommend it for parents if you are merely getting it for the size of its screen. Yes, for me, i think it's pretty decent device to use where you can do so many things.","November 13, 2012",
mobile phone,Don't kid yourselves this is no iPhone,"J. Whitehead ""Avid reader""",R1QQ3R3BPKCR2I,3,"I replaced an ailing Iphone 4 that was two years old for the New Samsung Galaxy S3 and found it to be very disappointing. Though it does many things more than the iphone, the few things that a phone should do, don't compare to the performance of the Iphone. A swiss army knife is a poor substitute for a tool that does a few things well. Despite having a larger screen, I find the clarity and pixle density on the iphone to be better. The porcessor and ram are also better on the Samsung but you wouldn't know it by using them both. I couldn't find an easy way to shut down programs without opening various menus and had horrible battery life because of it. I ultimately just like the structure of the App store and IOS on Apple so much better. I also found that Flash doesn't work on the New Samsung so the only supposed plus over the iphone is false. I really thought that the competition was heating up against Apple but with this newest phone it looks like Apple is still ahead.","August 21, 2012",
mobile phone,"The good, the bad, and the ugly.",Everyone,R2CGZ1JW47ORJW,3,"If you don't read anything else in this review, read ""The Ugly"" section. Some of the problems with this phone are important to cover, and may be a dealbreaker for many. I've had this phone for a month now, and I want to share my thoughts. The device has some really fantastic features that I absolutely love. It also has some serious knocks against it that really drag the experience down. I honestly find myself wondering now if I should have stuck with my last phone, the previous Evo 4g, for a little while longer.The good:Most reviews rave about some specific features of this phone, and I can say that the raving is justified. The screen is gorgeous. It is bright, and the resolution makes everything crisp and clear. The camera is as good as they say it is. It is an entirely new class of phone camera. It is incredibly fast and responsive, and the picture quality is simply amazing. With my old Evo 4g, I enjoyed the pics but never harbored any illusion that they were as good as those of a dedicated camera. With the Evo 4g LTE, the camera is easily as good as any point and shoot on the market today. The slow-mo video is a fun feature, the ability to capture a pic while taking video is fantastic, the hardware button is wonderful, and most of all I love the rapid-capture ability. It really is just a fantastic camera.ICS is a great upgrade over older versions of android. On the Evo 4g LTE it is fast and responsive, with hardly a stutter to be seen. Little things like the ability to unlock directly to an app really make a big difference. The music player has been nicely tweaked over older iterations, I especially like that it now acts as a hub for all the music capabilities of the phone: pandora, mp3s, etc. I general the OS feels more intuitive and responsive than older iterations, as it should.The battery life seems to be very respectable. Part of why I upgraded was that my old Evo's battery was showing its age and could barely last 10 hours without needing a recharge. The Evo 4g LTE lasts multiple days on a single charge with light use, which is plenty for my needs.The microSD slot is pretty easily accessible, and offers the ability to cheaply upgrade the phone's storage.The bad:Apparently (according to a bit of google searching) there are multiple screen manufacturers for the phone, and not all screens are built equal. While my phone's screen is generally great, it has a VERY noticeable flicker when displaying certain colors. Specifically the light grey shade that you see when the Google Play (market) app opens flickers like an old low refresh-rate monitor. It isn't an issue very often, but it is very disconcerting.The build quality of the Evo 4g LTE is pretty suspect. The front of the phone feels super solid and I have no doubt that the glass will hold up over time. The same can be said about the brushed aluminum bezel, back panel, and kickstand. But the gloss plastic that covers 50% of the phone's backside is already showing wear and tear, after less than a month. I baby my electronics, and my two-year-old Evo 4g is in nearly perfect condition. The glossy plastic portions of the Evo 4g LTE already creak alarmingly under pressure, and I do not feel confident that they will stand up to the test of time. There is a noticeable gap between the removable plastic cover and the surrounding aluminum bezel. The build quality is surprisingly poor compared to my previous experience with HTC, and honestly even when compared to other portions of the Evo 4g LTE itself.A few features of ICS are not as intuitive as one would like. My old Evo 4g instantly and automatically linked all of my contacts with their facebook information, thus filling in things like birthdates, and most importantly profile pictures. ICS (and maybe Sense had something to do with this) did not. It took quite a bit of digging around, and some work on google to figure out how to enable the facebook linkage. Until then, all of my contacts had default grey outline pictures.The ugly:This is where the phone starts to fall apart for me. The network capabilities are awful. They are a clear downgrade from my Evo 4g. I live in Kansas City, and my old Evo 4g had both excellent 3g coverage, and excellent WiMax coverage. Ping times were the only problem I had with WiMax (typically in the 200-300 range), but I typically got 3-7Mbps down and ~1Mbps up with very reliable coverage, especially in my home. Outside of WiMax range, I reliably got 3g coverage that pulled ~1-2Mbps down and up. This is what I would expect, given that I am in Sprint's home market.I upgraded to the Evo 4g LTE after hearing that LTE was officially ""live"" in Kansas City. Unfortunately the news that I missed was that by ""live"", they really mean ""about 30% live"". There is little to no actual LTE coverage in the city. At my apartment, where WiMax was previously very strong, I can only connect to LTE rarely, and when I do the signal is so weak that my connection times out regularly. Watching antenna strength, the LTE connection sits around -115 to -120dBm (in non-technical terms, that is just a hair above zero bars). I actually disabled the LTE antenna on my phone because it is disruptive FAR more often than it is useful.""So what"", you might say. ""Just use 3g"". I would agree with you. 3g should be able to get me by in the next few months while Sprint continues their LTE rollout, hopefully with an antenna near my home. Unfortunately the phone's 3g antenna is also highly problematic. 3g signal pickup is weaker than my old Evo 4g, and speeds are considerably worse than my previous phone. Pings usually sit around 200, which is acceptable, but I almost never get above 0.5Mbps down, or up. Additionally (and even more importantly), the phone has a habit of dropping the 3g signal. I tether often, and when I do I tend to lose 3g every few minutes. This is in close proximity to a 3g tower, and with a strong signal (4-5 bars, in the -70 to -80dBm range). The phone will just inexplicably lose 3g connectivity. Google around a bit and find out: this is a known problem that many people are dealing with, and HTC/Sprint have acknowledged the issue and are trying to rectify it. Problem is, it isn't fixed. I truly hope that in the near future an OTA update will fix the problems... after all, I'm basically stuck with this phone for the next 23 months. The network issues are bad enough that I really do miss my old Evo 4g, and I'm very tempted to reactivate it.Conclusion: at the end of the day, the Evo 4g LTE is a phone, and as such I think the network issues are a pretty big deal. If you are on WiFi constantly, then they won't be an issue for you, but if you're dependent upon Sprint's network in any way, be very careful... this phone has some major baggage.Update 9/25/2012: A couple OTA updates later, and it is still in pretty bad shape. I am very used to 500ms+ ping now, and 0.1Mbps download/upload speeds. 4g coverage is still nonexistant. According to xda and s4gru, this problem is SPECIFIC TO THE EVO 4g LTE. As in an iPhone 5 and SGIII will both connect just fine to 4g, but an Evo in the same room will not.Try this neat trick: Go to craigslist and search for Evo 4g LTE. See how many nearly new Evos are being sold for less than half the price of a new one? That speaks more volumes than my review does.","August 23, 2012",
mobile phone,Ups and downs,Craig Rutkowske,R3E7IW7XQOQPU1,3,"Pros:-The battery life is good if you turn off the 4G lte antenna. I'm in a location that doesn't have this available yet.-The screen is beautiful.-The phone is faster than the original EVO, but I don't notice any huge difference.-I've had 0 problems with the phone crashing/resetting after a couple of months.-The button on the side for the camera is a nice touch.-It was incredibly easy to transfer all my information from my previous EVO, almost like I never switched phones.-The structural design is smarter, when you set it down it doesn't scratch the hell out of the camera lens like the last one did.Cons:-The multi tasking is terrible, want to reload the web page you were just looking at two seconds ago because you sent a text message? This is a common problem for me for almost any application and is incredibly irritating.-The 3G antenna is sub par in my experience. In places that I get 5 bars of cell service I constantly have data connection issues and am unable to load up the simplest things.-Can't change the battery out so if you're away for a long period of time you'll need to bring your charger.All in all it's an ok phone, but I don't feel it is worth the price I paid for it.","September 7, 2012",

mobile phone,One out of three is not good enough.,Dennis,R3TMP99A8BKTTN,3,"First. I purchased three phones two months ago. I really like the Android operating system. And this phone uses the features well. Especially since HTC offered an upgrade to Jelly Bean. But there are problems. Two of the phones have already failed. After two months. The first had a bad battery. Since this phone does not have a replaceable battery, the phone had to be replaced. This was after one month. Now after two months, the GPS chip has failed on another phone.Sprint's answer is to offer ""Remanufactured"" phones. In other words a ""used"" phone. After just two months, with two phones failing, I don't think used phones are the answer for this situation.I have had to take these phones to two different Sprint stores to even get service. The only Sprint repair facility in our town said there was no problem with the phone. Had to go 40 miles to another store to get acknowledement that there really is a problem. Now the offer of a ""Remanufactured"" phone.To sum up I don't have warm, fuzzy feelinig for HTC or Sprint.I will need to do another review about the problems i have had with Sprint. i am considering just paying the ""early termination"" fee so I can move to another carrier.","January 8, 2013",
mobile phone,released before ready,"Callan Baird ""midnightrider""",R1N5BPPCOM3CJN,3,"Big disappointment after being very happy with the original Evo4G. PLEASE READ UPDATE AT BOTTOM.The battery life is MUCH better and the camera and big screen are nice, but otherwise it is a very disappointing phone.Unstable operating system, very poor 3G speed, 3G frequently loses connection requiring reboot, no 4G networks available, the only way to access Soundhound is by going through the HTC music application, generally frustrating phone. I wish I bought the S3 instead and lost any favor for HTC and have lost respect for Sprint for releasing an product before their network is ready and the bugs are worked out of the product, consequently offering inferior performance, but still think they provide the best customer service.UPDATEI actually got the Samsung S3 and I must admit, I think the HTC Evo 4G LTE was a better phone. I think most of the issues were due to Sprints network being upgraded and some software issues the HTC had regarding that. HTC has a much better interface though, the camera was amazing and, overall, if I could have just had a more consistent connection with it, it would have been the better phone. I really don't like my S3. I guess it is just a rough time to have Sprint.","October 20, 2012",

Look forward to LTE arriving, hopefully speeds will increase to 6-8MB/s average and get to keep UNLIMITED data.*UPDATE 1/8/2013*In the 4 months of ownership my wife's device has had issues. Twice it would not power on after unplugging from charger. Each instance it took 7+ hours of repeated attempts to power on. My device has twice had connectivity issues. And today my device would repeatedly restart. Called Sprint and made an appt for repair. I am hoping for the best. Have some regrets in purchasing a device with non-removable battery.","September 8, 2012",
mobile phone,Even Better than the Original,Kenneth C. Mitchell,R1ZD9O3BY4QB6R,3,"The HTC Evo 4G LTE smartphone is even thinner, even bigger, even better than the original.I thoroughly enjoyed my EVO 4G for the two years than I used it. There were some MINOR problems; limited internal RAM for applications, and the battery was terrible (until I bought an expanded battery).The new EVO 4G LTE has resolved these problems, and added a couple of great new features. (There wasn't much room for improvement!)First, the EVO LTE has lots of internal memory, which is LOTS of space for apps and music. Second, the internal battery is far better than the original. My only concern is that there doesn't appear to be a way to replace the battery when it degrades, as every battery does.Finally, the camera is spectacular, and with one feature that I don't think I've seen mentioned in other reviews. When you hold the phone up in typical camera orientation, there's a new button that is precisely where you might expect a shutter button to be - and that's what it is. Press the shutter button to switch into the camera mode, then press again to take a picture. Press and HOLD the shutter button, and it starts taking 6 pictures per second until you release.There's even a ""Best Picture"" button in which the smartphone itself tries to figure out which of these was the ""best"" picture, and it's pretty accurate.All in all, a very nice improvement in what was already the best smartphone around!_______________________________And 18 months later.....The HTC Evo 4G LTE phone is still a delight to use; too bad it's tied to a broken service. Sprint service was bad and has gone downhill from there, so that when this contract is over, I'm switching to another carrier. It's just not worth the hassle. There does not appear to be ANY LTE service in California, even where the map says there should be some. I live in Sacramento, in the middle of the state; there's not supposed to any LTE coverage, here, but there is supposed to be LTE coverage in SF and in LA - and my phone won't connect there.Long term, I still love the phone - but Sprint stinks.","September 6, 2012",
mobile phone,Major Flaws -- Very Disappointed -- EDIT 10/24/13,Donnie who loved bowling,R1ZHR5H03JHTBR,3,"As a very happy EVO 4G owner, I was so excited to get my hands on the next generation of HTC EVO. After about a month, I'm sorry to say that this phone is HORRIBLE compared to its predecessor.Let's begin with the biggest issue: Google Navigation does not work. When I open Navigation, it freezes and crashes within a minute. I've tried everything to fix the problem and nothing works. I've done extensive research on the internet and found that this problem has existed since December for a good portion of HTC EVO LTE owners. As far as I can tell, there is no fix. HTC is not working on the problem. Google doesn't seem to be working on it.Navigation is one of the most basic functions of a smartphone, and it simply doesn't work on this phone. I've downloaded a 3rd party nav app, but that's not really an acceptable work around since I can't navigate straight from an address on a website or even using voice commands.Secondly, the stock browser is very poor. While in the browser, the notification bar keeps popping down over and over, but there are no notifications. Typing in text fields in the browser is very frustrating because the Swype keyboard starts acting very erratic, making all kinds of corrections, jumping all over the place... it's maddening. The only fix is to download Firefox or Chrome.I've also had issues with apps like Angry Birds and Calculator crashing.If you're in the market for a ""top of the line"" smartphone that has a useless browser, non-functioning navigation, and apps that occasionally just crash for no reason, this is your phone.I MUST ADD: The reason all of this is so frustrating is because this is a BEAUTIFUL phone with a fast processor, great display, and a GREAT camera. Why make such an incredible piece of hardware and then sell it with STUPID software issues? These are issues that should be EASILY resolved. Until then, I would recommend no one make the mistake of buying this phone like I did.******** ADDED 10/24/13 ********OK, so most of the problems have been resolved by this point. I'm still pretty unhappy about having to go like 6 months without functioning navigation, but whatever.All in all, this is a pretty good phone. I'm not sure in hindsight that I would have made the same choice, but at least things have gotten a lot better.","February 15, 2013",
mobile phone,Make sure you don't buy it from Sprint!,"K. Leist ""GeekyMom""",RB0E0BTX1ZOET,3,"The phone itself is pretty good. Be aware however, the battery is internal and you can't change it out yourself. Big bucks for Sprint! It does not come with an SD card and only a wall charger, so there are a lot of accessories you will need to purchase to get your phone to work at it's best. Also, Buy this phone from Amazon or Best Buy, if you decide to buy it. Sprint will not price match or Guarantee their price. I just bought this phone 4 days ago at the Sprint store for $200. They don't treat their customers well. Their response was smug and basically telling me I'm stupid for buying from them. Think twice about dealing with them.","June 7, 2012",
mobile phone,htc evo 3D 4G,Glitch-Dad,R39X8OOOGZ75R3,3,"I've been using this phone for about two months and my best descriptive term is ""meh"". I mean, it's been my first smartphone and I expected, after all the years of smartphone technology, better.The phone is a great phone - when it's working. Good display, good sound, plenty of handy features. I like the OS and UI. It is a good piece of hardware when functioning as advertised.But it seems that every week or two it locks up and I have to pull the battery to get a hard reset. It won't turn on or it won't accept the touchscreen input, but something just quits working and it turns into a paperweight until I crack the case, pull the battery and start over from scratch. IF that doesn't bother you, it's a pretty nice tool.","January 3, 2013",
mobile phone,People cant see me when on skype,"Lynica Darnell ""Lynica""",R2TUA8SSQCBVUH,3,"For some reason, people cant see me during skype, which is the main reason of me buying this phone.

They fixed it, so I can upload pictures to facebook when we were out, then that night, got a message to update the system, thinking that it will make it work, I updated it. Then the phone went back to before my visit to Sprint during my vacation.. unable to upload pictures, but connection etc. Until today, I still cant upload picture when on facebook, have to go to my picture and click to share and choose facebook to load it that way..... waiting to have time one day to visit the store and see if they can help.

mobile phone,Broken by fingernail,"Mr. ""Snazzy Dresser""",R2M5Q4HA7KEHN7,3,I purchased my S3 2 weeks ago and I have thoroughly enjoyed it until this morning. The home button on this phone is really narrow and while pressing this button the screen cracked. I wasn't even pressing hard. My fingernail was strong enough to shatter the screen just above the button. This is not covered by Samsung's warranty. They charge $178 + shipping to repair it. This has to change if they want to compete with Apple. Not recommended for fat fingered people like myself or those with the index fingernail of death.,"August 18, 2012",
mobile phone,Expected Better,suzi,R3O0KQW6E6PH2J,3,"I am a big Android fan. Never had any problems until I purchased the Samsung Galaxy S3. Within 6 weeks I have had 3 of them. Aside from getting many drop calls (Verizon) it WILL NOT work at my office at all. Can not send or receive text and Every phone call I have ever made from my office (which is in a huge service area)will not go through. It always says ""no sim card"" and/or out of the service area. I can not receive calls either. Additionally, I have had changed sim card 1/2 dozen times. It makes no sense at all. Verizon can't figure it out and Samsung can't figure it out. I am returning it for the 4th time. I'm done with it.... Hope everyone else has better luck. Everything else on the phone is perfect, but what good is a cell phone if it won't allow you to make or receive a call...","September 21, 2012",
mobile phone,"The jury is still out, but users beware---",Austin reader,R1OTMQ6AH70SGO,3,"Important Note: The following is written regarding a Samsung Galaxy S III that I bought from another vendor for use with Sprint, in the states. It is NOT the phone shown on this page.This phone will NOT give you true 4G UNLESS you live in a city where 4G LTE is active. It cannot access the 4G WIMAX network. Sad fact, I thought I was trading up from my 4G Wimax SII. Now I have a much slower phone that is stuck in 3G until Austin rolls out 4G LTE, by this year's end, according to Sprint. Also, please note that you cannot shift your apps to a mini SD in your SII and then have your SIII see them. It is not able to read apps off of an SD card. Music and pics worked OK, for me, but others have complained, online, that their old SD was invisible to the SIII. Better to dump old files to your computer, do a reformat of the mini in the SIII and then load it up. As far as the screen, speaker volume, extra features are concerned, so far, so good. I've had the phone less than 24 hrs. I will update, here, as things move along. UPDATE: 9/14/12--The battery life is not much better than the SII, if you are using your phone for GPS, texting, a few calls, a few internet fact checks, each day. I get about eight hours, just like with my SII. The main reason I bought this phone and traded in my SII was because of a site that compared them, feature by feature. In looking at that site, again, I honestly believe it was put up by Samsung and/or Sprint, to generate interest and sales of the SIII. This is not noted anywhere on the site. What is on the site is a ""stretching"" of the truth. If I had it to do over, I would have kept my SII until 4G LTE was firmly established in my area. Thinking about that, if 4G Wimax was to stay up, knowing what I know now, I probably would still have kept my SII. I don't see much difference between the two. UPDATE: 9/23/12---Just tried this phone with wi-fi at Sprint store---Blazing fast! Amazing! The salesperson said the 4G LTE will be faster, yet, and it will be in Austin by Jan. 1st, 2013. This phone is looking better to me, right now. UPDATE: 11/18/2012: You need to check out exactly what your version of this phone comes with. Because of the international consumer base, those companies marketing these phones try to give the impression that everyone gets the same unit, same features. WRONG! The US version of this phone does not have remote control. Signing up for a Samsung account does NOT suddenly put this feature on your phone. In the settings menu, the remote control option is missing, entirely. That being the case, you cannot remotely lock or wipe your phone, in the US, like you can with the Iphone. You cannot find your phone, remotely. There are apps that supposedly give you this capability. They are all garbage, and you should know that those touting their efficacy are, most likely, shills for the companies putting them out there to fill the void left by this feature's absence on this phone. In the comments section, here, you will probably find a few saying how great this program or that one is for remote functions. Try them all, like I did, and you will find that they are worthless. Be careful, while trying them, as well, since you will give the companies permissions that may make you ripe for identity theft. You've been warned. UPDATE, 1/7/2013: My area now has 4G LTE. The Verdict: Nothing to get excited about. I was told that 4G LTE was faster than the Wi-Fi I tried at the Sprint store. Nonsense! It drags and, at times, is just about the same as 3G, sluggish. Also, push e-mail has disappeared from the phone with the last few updates. You are never cued when you have new email. You must refresh to load it. This is a pain, and is not fixable, at this point, as the many, new internet posts on this problem will attest to. I am not excited about this phone, not excited about Sprint, and I've been with them since the time their name was leased by a local company, starting in 1992! They used to be cool, used to give me deals that others didn't get. Now I'm lumped in with everyone else, and that's that. In the end, this phone is OK, but only OK, all things considered. As the competition falls by the wayside, as phone manufacturers and servers drop off and yield to the two or three remaining, you can expect that all of the hassles we put up with, with the old Bell System, will come to the fore. The only difference will be that vocal quality will probably never be as clear as what it was on 1960 land lines. Kind of ironic, that. UPDATE: 2/28/13: I am on the verge of leaving Sprint. Their 4G LTE network is a joke, in much of Austin. I cannot stream anything in my home location. The tower techs say that the issue may be resolved by Sept. of this year, but they're not sure! Bah! What they're not saying is that tower climbers are hard to find and those with the tech smarts to tune dishes and antennas are rarer still. It is a dangerous business with no national certifying body. I've actually looked into becoming a tower climber as my present profession keeps me sixty feet up trees, and I love it up there. As for the phone: The buttons for volume and shut-off are very poorly placed: When you go to change the volume, you often turn the phone off because the buttons are exactly opposite each other, on either side of the phone. This is an annoying design flaw and needs to be remedied in later versions. As the phone struggles to find signals on the terrible Sprint network, it gets very hot. I'm sure, at times, it gets hot enough to cause serious burns.","September 8, 2012",

Some reviews said that the iPhone is sluggish, kind of out-dated and what not. I don't totally agree. It was reliable, this phone is NOT reliable. My screen flickers when playing games, the keyboard is a crap shoot. I can't even type a text message without having to go through and edit it. It locks up on me and at least once a week I have to reboot it because the TouchWiz stops responding.Other than that it's a good phone. I would just rather have a reliable phone. And really the keyboard is my biggest issue, I am a big texter and poster on facebook.... this phone ugh I want to throw it out the window at times!So in conclusion, if you are used to android, go for it.

I will look into an extended battery, but this situation is really worrying me. How can I travel any distances with such a battery-draining cellphone? I have had to turn this phone off at times during the day just to keep it going while I am away and even then it is at the critical ""almost dead"" zone before I get home.The phone freezes up at times. Several times I have had to take out the battery and reboot the phone. The Facebook app freezes up. Sometimes the phone just acts weird - like when it kept calling my daughter when I was trying to call other people.Not sure what is up, but if it weren't for the larger screen size and the lower price tag of the Samsung Galaxy S3, I would have opted for the Iphone 5.I am hoping that a trip to Radio Shack for some pointers will help me with this cumbersome phone.

So now, while i'm writing this review i'm on the phone with amazon trying to see what my options are on getting a phone that i spent 700 dollars on exchanged for one that is actually worth the 700 dollars i spent. After i started doing research to try and find a fix to my issue i found that there are many people that have are having these issues among other ones also. Now i'm not saying that all the galaxy S3's have these issues but it's kind of hit or miss. i was very weary on buying a phone outside of my local att store primarily due to warranty issues like i'm having now. My advice is make sure you get an extended warranty with your phone and make sure the people that have these extended warranties have many good reviews saying that they honor those warranties. Because nobody wants to be told like i just was that because it's been almost 2 months since i bought my phone that if i send it back that i might only get a partial refund that was faulty in the first place. I hope that amazon tries to help me without making me go without a phone.UPDATE: I was told by amazon that they would (One Time Only) offer me a full refund which is pretty awesome but i have to first call samsung and see if they can help me with this issue.

mobile phone,"Decent phone, lots of ""We Don't Care"" in the interface",Griswel,R35L5QF038TVSG,3,"Overall this phone is fine, camera, looks, weight, screen space. I'm not going to repeat what others have said.I do want to add my two cents on the avoidable problems Samsung has included in the phone.- silent doesn't silence the phone, apps make noise even when the phone is set to silent, so either silence each app or turn off your phone;- turning the phone off is a three step process, it's only two steps to launch nuclear missiles to start WW3 (trust me);- the text input feature screams ""We Don't Care"". Nevermind autocorrect prediction, that's no better or worse than others and actually picks up your habits reasonably well. The absence of a real keypad is a problem, too, but I have no reason to think this touchscreen is worse than others. Among other problems, if you delete back to use autocorrect, every word you have typed is deleted except for the first word and the new one. That strikes me as inexcusable, no-one would ever want that to happen. In the end, you have to get used to manually correcting anything unless you stick to very short texts.","May 23, 2013",

mobile phone,One of the best worse phones ever.,"rodjoh ""rodjoh""",R32U78XNCZ59M4,3,"The Galaxy S3 is a great phone. It really is. It's powerful, it looks and feels good, and it is relatively durable if you treat it right. It runs smoothly on Ice Cream Sandwich and not-quite-as-smoth-but-well-enough on Jelly Bean. It's a nice upgrade from the Galaxy S2 for sure. There are many cool features I like about it, such as the smart Look, motion controls, lock screen shortcuts, S Voice and more.It is also full of nasty, inexcusable flaws. The S3 has earned a bad rep of suffering from ""Sudden Death Syndrome"", constant freezes and resets and other nasty issues like charging ports going bad. These don't start happening right away.. they usually start showing up after a few months of use.I don't know if all S3s are faulty. I've read a lot about these issues, I've heard the feedback... most of the people that I know that had S3s have had issues with it, and myself as well. For such an expensive device, for it to get bricked out of nowhere is just not acceptable by any means. It is true that all electronics are subject to break like that, but when you see a trend happening then that's no isolated case.The issue seems to be related to faulty internal memories on the 16GB model. This is just the conclusion I've settled with after a bunch of reading on this issue. Fortunately if you have a little patience and if you remain under warranty, you could probably still get your phone fixed. But otherwise if you can't count on being covered like that I'm afraid to say I wouldn't recommend anyone to invest on this phone.It's a shame though, cause otherwise it IS a great device. Thankfully there are many options to choose from out there.","October 29, 2013",

I have to charge it about 3 times a day even when I turn off my data, GPS, and turn my screen brightness to the lowest possible level. The camera is pretty good, nothing to complain about. Sound quality is average in my opinion. I do love how vivid the screen is compared to others released at its time. The design in general gets boring fairly fast. The messaging system isn't the greatest, but the phone is set up to be very convenient. All in all this phone was pretty amazing when first released but with all shiny new things it's fading pretty fast and easily forgettable. Would I recommend this phone?

Samsung phones are plastic. Its a big piece of plastic and its needs a strong case. Hence it gets bulky. Angain the screen is very nice, but android is still slow even on this model. Compared to the iPhone 5, it has a larger screen. But because I find android to be unstable from time to time, I would say the iPhone is the better phone. It takes better quality photos, the iPhone is made better, you do get a year of apple involvement. You don't get and Samsung involvement. The iPhone has better resale.

mobile phone,Not bad!,Andrew Langstaff,R3DC0CB3B95C1X,3,"I had this phone for over 6 months now and below is my opinion about it.1. PriceSamsung achieved top position in mobile world due to best hardware at aggressive pricing but HTC ONE-X is quad core too clocked at 1.5 GHz and available at lesser price.2. ResolutionResolution of 720 x 1280 Pixels is very promising and produces a realistic display quality with high contrast and sharp looking images.3. ScreenAccording to a consumer survey 4 inch screens are most appropriate for single hand use whereas screens like 5.3 of Note and 4.8 of S3 have reduced the mobility comfort in mobiles. People end up using both hands to operate such large screens. Not to mention the increased risk of screen cracking due to inevitable rough usage. Otherwise AMOLED screen quality is phenomenal.4. BatteryBattery (2100 mAH) is quite impressive and works beyond expectations on heavy duty of such large screen and quad core processor.5. Build QualityPeople might like rounded corners and plastic finish but personally I feel the cheap looking plastic design is toy like and doesn't gives a premium look. Its a matter of individual taste.6. CameraCamera is 8mp same as that of Galaxy S2 with improved interface and color sharpness. courtesy- Android v4 ICS. Front camera is also provided.7. GraphicsGraphics have not been improved, same old Mali-400MP as that of Galaxy S2. But Quad core makes its own contributions.8. Other FeaturesHowever Samsung has always amazed its customers by setting new benchmarks in mobile world. Android Ice-cream sandwich is icing on the cake. S view and S stay though new features but are little unreal in the fast world where we cant wait and press for long, speak to mike, wait for system response and then affirm. Phew !

mobile phone,"It won't turn on now, but even when working it was glitchy","W. Vaughn ""Jennifer Vaughn""",R27EJNE78K9F31,3,"After two months of light use, my phone will not turn on completely. When I press the power button, it does that little buzzing vibration like it always did when starting up. The LG logo appears, and after a few moments the Virgin mobile screen (with song) pops up, then a moment later it says ""Powering Off"" and turns off without having loaded/started up at all. Or sometimes the Virgin Mobile screen with song gets cut off and it just turns off immediately.Since it is after 30 days, I can't return it. It appears I have to use the warranty, pay for shipping, and send it in for repair.Even when it worked properly, it takes a long time to start up and be ready for use.My wife has had the same phone for 3 months, and sometimes hers is glitchy. Like when pressing the icon for one app it starts up something different, and can only be fixed by turning the phone off and back on.UPDATE:I contacted Amazon customer service & they were prompt and helpful in replacing the defective phone.But I also discovered that the phone battery was completely drained & would not accept a charge when plugged in ...UNTIL removing the battery, waiting 30 seconds, and putting it back in. It must have reset itself because it finally charged up again.The paper manual has no trouble shooting tips, but you can find tips like this on the Amazon reviews & the Virgin Mobile reviews for this phone.I also discovered by trial & error, that uninstalling & reinstalling some apps (like Netflix) will fix them...but that's a pain.Also there is a loud, annoying song that plays everytime you turn the phone on. Virgin Mobile customer service said it can't be removed. So I've had to develop the habit of putting the phone on silent mode before turning it off, to avoid hearing that song again upon start up.This is my first smartphone, and it's been really handy, but there are some more annoyances. Like when typing, the auto suggest will often replace properly spelled words with other words, making me sound like an idiot on my posts & emails. I have to spend time proof reading everything. It's a pain. And on the keypad, the English/Spanish button is situated in a place where it is always getting brushed by my thumb, so my words end up getting translated to Spanish, and I have to waste time correcting them one by one.The voice recognition is sometimes nice, but often inserts words that are completely wrong so I again have to waste time correcting mistakes.","October 7, 2012",
mobile phone,"Nice and thin, handles better than my old Samsung Intercept:Update 2013","Mostlee - Cleric ""Everquest fan""",RAUTOGSSGVF3W,3,"I purchased the phone through amazon on Friday 7/20/12, received it 4 days later and so far so good. I was able to install a 16gb class 10 mini SD card, added about 50 apps, half of which I still currently use most of the time and I still have about 160 to 199M memory left. Whatever apps could be saved on the SD card, I did so to save internal memory. Thinking back, my old phone (also through Virgin Mobile) was a Samsung Intercept and I usually experienced crashes due to lack of internal memory.With my old phone, I deleted as many apps as I could and monkeyed around with it, but it still got bogged down. Enter...LG Optimus Elite! In some ways, it does remind me of my old phone, but the screen is obviously larger. Unlike the Intercept, I find myself using styli more often then not. I also picked up a keyboard that allows me to type in larger blocks of text for notes, etc. It uses blutooth and I have to remember to go through some steps to use that. I had to order bypassing software in order to run it for my phone though a company overseas. Well worth it to me though. Read my other reviews about that story.I found a protector frame (silicone?) for the phone which makes it look more like an I phone. I also have become efficient in removing the outer and inner frame in order to remove the battery, should it become necessary. And to think I also bought that other phone which prevents you from doing so. Speaking of battery, it doesn't last an entire 24 hours even with the GPS turned off, etc. I do keep a few alarms up as well as a weather updater.The surprise with Virgin Mobile for me was that my monthly rate was going up. I guess I should have read all the very fine print provided on the website stating which models or release dates pertained to that change. Turns out, I don't mind so much since I made sure to use only wifi at home and the most minutes I've used are around 200 minutes/month, so I was able to stay with the cheapest plan now offered. I can also watch a movie streaming over 3G or wifi, no problem. THAT, my old phone could never do. Internet searches are now pretty good and I've used it often to compare online prices to store's prices, not to mention, read reviews on amazon.com.All in all, I like this new phone pretty much and I would carry more often, but the added frame makes it a little to heavy to just throw in my pocket. I certainly wouldn't put it in a pocket without a case or protection of some kind. After I have had it a year, I'll update the review. I may not, if the phone is rendered old school like so many have before.6/25/13: 1 year update (11 months actually). First, that silicone hybrid protector has been a phone saver for me. I can't tell you how many times my hubby dropped his HTC EVO V 4G out of his front shirt pocket when leaning forward. Silicone = staying stuck in place. As for the phone, it's on it's last legs. Good thing that I bought it with the amazon card promo. That puts it at almost $8.00 per month for me (would have been $11.80/month at full price).Current problems: 1) The charging port is getting loose, 2) I am now not getting notifications of my calls and texts, for the most part (my first hint that I'm getting a call is when VM notifies me of a voice mail message...I did check my prefs to make sure that calls aren't getting sent to VMail), 3) getting a signal is more difficult than ever, 4) I'm able to get home long before my text gets to my intended party (I send an ""I'm on my way"" message before I take off...15 minutes later, bing!)but I'm already home. That last one could be Virgin Mobile's doing, not sure how. I'm now looking at Samsung Galaxys, jelly bean.","September 6, 2012",

However, it is not any faster than the Optimus V being limited by 3G. The most aggravating feature is that the poorly designed touch pad for text entry in the V is even worse in the Elite. There is a language switch button adjacent to the shift/numbers key. So when you type and accidently hit ""esp"" you are now in Spanish letters. If you need the dual language capability this is a great phone for that purpose.The accelerometer is a bit better as you do not have to rattle the phone as much to make the screen landscape/portrait.Unlike the package sold with the V there is just the phone and charger -- no ear buds or any other accessories.","August 6, 2013",

mobile phone,Coming from LG Optimus V - Newer not always better,"dhascall ""Non-Fiction Lover""",R3G4G5A2UGQBDA,3,"I bought an LG Optimus V, for Virgin Mobile, and their Beyond Talk plan ($25 month 300 , unlimited everything else plan) in Jan 2011. Three years later, she was getting a little flaky, so I decided to upgrade. VM no longer has the $25/month plan. They will grandfather you in, if you upgrade to a mid 2012 phone or older. VM provided me a list of phones that I could use and remain in the $25 plan and the LG Optmus Elite was one of them.I found a new in box one on eBay with a Buy it Now price of $59.99, shipped. I received it and I immediately noticed that it was slimmer. That was cool and I noticed the LED flash for the camera and a reset button. All good and in fact, as we find out later, having a reset ""hole"" is good but not in a good way.The biggest beef with the Optimus ""V"" is on phone memory. Less than 400 mb! I had to uninstall apps that i wanted to keep. Yes I could move them to the 16 Gb micro-SD card but some bits and bytes still remained on the phone and i had to have two apps to contstantly clean the memory. The Elite has a little short of 1 Gb of ""phone"" storage and a bit short of 2 Gb of ""Internal memory,"" which i assume is a virtual SD card. I bought a 32 Gb micro SD card but the phone won't let me move apps to that as it thinks that virtual SD card is real one. Google needs to add that option (iinternal SD, or External SD) to the Android OS. I will use the external for music - not apps.The processor is listed as 800 MHz while the ""V"" model had only 600 MHz, under the hood. I actually find the Elite to be a bit slower. In fact, it often hangs when using apps that you would not expect them to tax the phone. I've had to pull the battery maybe a dozen times in less than a month, as it had became unresponsive. I did discover the reset button and that stoips from having to pull the battery. Speaking of the battery. Even worse battery time than the V.Although the phone seems to have better speakers than the V, I find call quality to be substandard. The V was much nicer.All in all, if you are looking to stay grandfathered in VM's old $25 or $40 plans, this phone is an option but it's not that great.PROs:Can keep in older VM Beyond Talk $25 or $40 plansThinnerCameras has an LED flash (can function as a flashlight with an app)CONsPoor speedFrequent phone freezes / lockupsPoor Call QualitySD card slot requirews removal of the back back of the phone","February 25, 2014",
mobile phone,Has its pros and cons,DevonKate,RMUPZ4R3W6RK7,3,"I've had the phone for a little over a month nowPros:-Box comes packed with accessories. Two batteries. Car charger. Regular charger socket (I requested an Irish and American one and they were happy to oblige). USB cable that fits the socket. Earphones (mine were broken). Instruction manual. Plastic case. 8gb micro SD card.-Screen Protector already fitted.-Runs latest version Android (Ice Cream Sandwich)-Looks very good-Dual SIM function very easy to use. I have both an Irish and American SIM card in at all times and it flawlessly works both at the same time. I receive messages and calls etc. from both when they come in. When sending messages or making phone calls it asks which SIM you would like to use. I have it set to default for one of them (depending on which country I'm in) so it doesn't bother me by asking.-Battery lasts a decent amount of time. I am a hardcore phone user, generally flicking through images and videos online and texting non stop. Battery lasts me for about 6 hours of solid use so should last all day for normal use. The included spare battery is very handy.-Takes micro USB charger (International standard charger)-No problems with signal or dropping calls like some other users have reported.-Speakers are very loud, great for playing music.-Takes panoramic photos. Difficult to get used to but a great feature when used correctly.-Resilient. I've dropped it a few times now and it hasn't been damaged yet. I've been trying to find a case for it but haven't found any that I like on Amazon as of yet. Some other users recommend Samsung Galaxy Note cases for it (they fit when the plastic back is on it according to some reviews)Cons:-Doesn't charge while in use. When I have it plugged in and I have the screen awake the battery percentage doesn't increase (nor does it decrease). I charge it overnight for this reason so it's not a big deal.-Sometimes shuts off when I unplug the charger but turns back on then.-T.V. function is for analogue T.V. only which has been replaced by digital in most countries worldwide so I haven't been able to use this function.-When I received it the home key button was actually scratched pretty badly. The rest of the phone looked flawless though and this didn't bother me enough to request a replacement.-Occasionally the touch screen misbehaves or becomes unresponsive. I find this happens frequently with the charger that was included. I just use an old Samsung charger that I have. The included charger is a bit short also.-The charger port is a little loose. I find that my Samsung charger falls out when moved at all. USB cables fit it perfectly though (which doesn't really make sense as they're supposed to be the same size..?)-Camera and flash not very good. My previous phone also had a 5MP camera with flash and in comparison the Star takes really low quality photos. The flash is the worst flash I have every seen on anything. It is literally just a light. A very dim light at that.Biggest pro is obviously the price. That cannot be beaten!Biggest con is the camera/flash.","January 25, 2013",
mobile phone,Review for Android N8000 5 inch screen android 4.0 smart phone,Cryssy,RU5QVTBW7DNK1,3,"This is a good phone even though it is a mimic of the Samsung galaxy. I would have rated it five star but i was a little disappointed with some of the features. firstly, i must say i like the the big screen and its brightness. i also like the fact that i can browse the internet very quickly. what i don't like about this phone is that the front camera takes terrible pictures and the rear camera is not all that good. Also, there is no led light flash notification on the phone so i cannot tell when i get a message or when i get a missed call without having to look at the phone itself.If you are someone who is looking for a phone to make excellent phone calls and have a great viewing then this is the phone for you. Also, it is good when it comes on to downloading apps, its just that some of the apps are not available from play store. So keep that in mind. Over all, it is a good phone, I've had mine for almost a month now and no major problems yet , just those that I have mentioned so.........Good Luck!! :-)","August 14, 2013",
mobile phone,Good and works fine,Alex Agyemang,R2X4JDKWK6VAHW,3,Its a good looking phone and I liked it and enjoyed using this smart phone the wi fi is fast to,"July 30, 2013",
mobile phone,"Not great, but okay",Lisa,R31BTFBZVWSZA6,3,"I wanted to love this phone, but no such luck. I wouldn't consider this a Samsung Note knock off. This is simply a less expensive note phone with half the quality of most name brands. I was able to use the AT&T; Straight Talk sim and get the same signal as on my HTC. I only have an HTC Status and a ZTE Warp to compare this to right now.Cons:WiFi- Horrible- I don't get a signal if I'm more than 7 feet away from the router. My other phones get the full 54mbps with excellent signal.Camera- Terrible. The pictures are horribly grainy and fuzzy. There are lines that run vertically that you can see before and after you snap a pic. I don't know if this is because the camera itself is crappy or if really is 5MP as advertised. I used Gtalk to vid chat with a friend that has a Samsung S3 and she looked amazing and clear, but my pic looked bad.Screen- Weird. Pictures viewed in a browser are great, however this depends on which angle you are holding the phone. While in upright position, viewing it from the left makes it look very dark and viewing it from the right makes everything look extra bright, almost white.Internal Memory- Sad. There is only 500MB!!! Even the cheap lower end phones have 1G or more. Sure you can expand by adding a micro sd card, but it's still ridiculous.RAM- 512MB as advertised, but I have around 160 with ONLY stock apps running.Available Memory- Soooo Low. According to Advanced Task Killer app I only have 127 available memory. Facebook uses about 40MB so there's no way I'm going to be able to install it. ïŒApps- I'm having a hard time finding a browser that works on it. There have been a lot of force closes. It always resets my default keyboard (Swiftkey) back to the Android keyboard when I turn it off.It always shows the signal bars for the 2nd SIM card slot even though I only use one, and notifies me that I don't have one in the first slot.The color and items it comes with depends on the seller you buy it from. I received this in white with 2 batteries, earphones, usb charger, hard case for the back, and a screen protector already on it.Pros:-good battery time. I was only down to 85% after being on for over 12 hours. However that was with minimal use.-comes with 2 batteries-large screen-actually came with Android 4.1.1 (jelly bean) instead of the 4.0 (ice cream sandwhich) as advertised-screen protector was already on-ringer and notification sounds were loud-boots really fastOverall: Not worth the price. You're paying for the large screen and the fact that it's advertised as a ""note"". This phone reminds me a lot of the $100 tablet I bought from walmart. The screen and camera quality (or lack thereof) is exactly the same, which was one of the reasons I returned the tablet. The Pros don't come close to outweighing the Cons. I'll be returning this as soon as I'm done with this review. :(","March 10, 2013",
mobile phone,Horrible reception,rebekah,R2UPZ7D2KWA3VQ,3,"The apps are good but the actual phone is horrible. The reception is horrible with many dropped calls. At times I have to use Skype, something I never had to do before.","February 7, 2013",
mobile phone,Better than expected.,Dex Rabe,RKWU1KN8K8AU0,3,"This phone met all my expectations and more. Then again, I did not set a high one base on the reviews. The key reason I bought these phone is that I travel a lot country to country and the Dual SIM card will help hotswapping and potentially losing a SIM. And for that, this device is fantastic. No issues putting and recognizing a SIM Card from UAE and Afghanistan. As for the OS, this was my first official ICS cell. I have always used test ICS ROMs prior and with a dedicated, stable one I was able to truly experience the benefits. It is fast and full of features such as swipe capabilities to running apps. But what impressed me the most is the battery life. At first I was skeptical with this item because it came with two batteries; inferring that the battery life was disappointing. However, luckily, that is not the case. This phone had an amazing standby time. I had it sitting in my bag for 3 days without use or charge and it still had about 78% life left. I used it none-stop to play games and it lasted the entire day before needing a charge; which is amazing for having a 5inch screen. I have yet to depend or require the second battery pack. As for the analog tv receiver, I was not impressed. I was able to get a couple channels while in Afghanistan and none in Dubai but I did not get it for that. And when I did test the ability to watch, it was difficult to pickup a station indoors (as expected of course). It was too cold to be outside to test. But when I did pick up a channel or two, the station came in acceptably clear and the volume/sound was clear and loud. The antenna however feels flimsy and seems like it will break easily; I haven't used it enough to use it to the extent. The biggest disappointment, however, is the WiFi which I was hoping to rely on. At times it cannot pick up a signal that is full strength compared to the strength represented on my laptop. And when I am connected, it sometimes does not retain if I blackout my screen to save battery. I guess that may be a good thing so I am not running the WiFi constantly in the background, if we are talking about battery management. Another disappointment, which is not a big deal, is the camera. The software seems to make images darker than normal. It could be because I had it set to HDR mode but I haven't yet considered testing out other settings to see which is best. I am surprised and happy it has a panorama and HDR setting at all. Lastly, I was often spoken of as having a ""Big @$$ phone"" because many are not use to having a 5inch screen. This though is actually smaller, thinner, and sleeker than other 5inch devices such as the Dell Streak (AKA Dell Mini 5). It fits well in the hand and for the purpose I use it for it is perfect; taking notes in replacement of using paper and pen. It fits nicely in my pocket without giving an uncomfortable bulge or provide an obvious appearance. So it will depend all in all on one's expected use of this that will vary the ratings. For a phone with dual SIM capabilities and proper size for notetaking it is fine. For others, it is simply below standard.","January 21, 2013",
mobile phone,Love how BIG it is!,jazzyjuice18,RM6P7ZLBK3V2L,3,"First off i most definitly want to say that i do love this phone. it does trumph iphones and its not too heavy either. i like the fact that its an android instead of any other brand because to me phones themselves are over rated.... but anywaysPro's1. huge screen2. screen and resolution is very clear3. home and multi screen's aer customizable4. the basics camera is pretty sharp5. nice and light6. you'll get plenty of comliments :)now the bad.cons:1. it drops my calls when i have my skullcandy earpiece in (not sure if it's the phone or not)2. the front facing camera is not as sharp as the opposing camera3. the speaker could be a little louder4. cant figure out how to get auto correct for my texting.now, i have only had this phone for about 3 days but if anything goes wrong i will gladly update.UPDATE::::Okay so i have now had the phone for about a week and it is okay but i am sending it back. My screen is getting stuck on home screen without any buttons and its really annoyin it happens almost every 5 minutes. It sucks because i really did like this phone and i was hoping that every thing would work outbut i guess not.","December 30, 2012",
mobile phone,Great phone but..........,Jenni,R1GDU44U9JXMOM,3,"-So as far as the functionality of this phone; it's good. Couple things i noticed is when it's on the charger and you're touching the screen doing anything, it goes a bit WAY TOO over sensitive so it clicks things or letters that you didn't and scrolls too quick... I tried to play with the sensitivity settings and it doesn't matter really it does the same thing when ON the charger. BUT off the charger it's just fine.- I went through ATT/Go Phone plan and it worked just fine, the only thing is even though my fiance had the SAME plan thru the SAME company and a different phone... his reception was MUCH better... which doesn't make too much sense but something to consider.- Another thing I noticed is the fact that this is a KNOCK OFF of the Samsung Galaxy NOTE I717/i9220. I know this because i do now have an authentic Samsung galaxy note ( NOT bought on amazon) and i compared them when i got it.- As far as cases, I could NOT find a case for this knock off phone because the dimensions on this knock off are smaller both height and width wise and the placement of the camera, mic, headphone jack etc are slightly moved around so trying to buy anything for it was impossible. I bought a hybrid case with kickstand that I thought would work but the knock off was too small. Now, that same phone case is FOR the Samsung Galaxy note, which fits snuggly and perfectly in every aspect for the Original phone. I would give the cases 0 out of 10. (Also, If we're talking more comparisons, the Original phone has an ""S-pen"" for it.... the knock off has an Antenna which in my opinion is placed awkwardly and doesn't even work. They advertise that you can get basic channels but no matter where I went there was nothing around. So as far as ""free channels""... I wouldnt count on it.)-The battery was alright for normal use but I found after about 2-3 months of regular normal use the battery life faded and I found myself always needing to charge it. They DO give you a second battery in the package BUT.... same result. So i'd give that a 5 out of 10.-The camera is surprisingly good-fair quality. Compared to the original, its about the same but not AS good. Still if you're looking for decent camera quality, it'd give it 7 out of 10.- Call quality is decent. (besides dropped calls mainly because the reception wasn't great) 7 out of 10-The screen quality and clarity is good as well. 8 of 10One thing I will touch on though and it's on both ends. The reason I had to get a new phone was because I dropped the phone flat ( accidentally) from a height of about a foot and a half maybe less and it COMPLETELY shot the phone. The Touch mechanism went out. I could turn it on, but no luck trying to get anything to work. Strangely enough, if i had it turned on or the battery just in the phone, the alarm would go off... but it's none that I set. Random times which was irritating so i just took the battery out. So I took the phone to a cell repair shop and they took it apart to see if maybe it's just a wiring problem and said the wiring is fine but twisted in a weird way. They couldn't find a physical reason why the touch went out but upon further inspection there is NO factory Reset button ANYWHERE and there is absolutely NO way to reset it if your touch goes out. It then becomes completely useless. The only thing i could recycle ( give to them to use again) on the phone was the battery. Otherwise they said there's nothing that can be done besides sending it back to the people I bought it from and although I considered it, I know it can be pricey and I am not willing to pay that or Wait because I needed a phone.- All in all, the phone is a good phone for functionality, calling, apps, downloading, internet and I know I didn't go through every single little detail about it, but please feel free to ask me questions because I remember better that way. I personally would not buy this phone again purely because I found the original is sooo much better and you get what you pay for, basically. If it's something for a teen or starter smartphone and you don't want to pay BIG then I'd say it's okay but if you want the guarantee authenticity then it's not for you. Ultimately I recommend reading others reviews as well and make your own decisions. Thanks for reading!","April 13, 2014",

mobile phone,"Customers are not always right but, it pays merchants, to grant them benefit-of-doubt",Ashimuneze Heanacho,RPNQV1I8CPUS5,3,"I think that this is a good product but, there is always a small probability that, at least, one in a huge line of products, such as Android smart telephones, would have a defect emanating from factory-processes or post-factory handling. I got the one, such item. It worked for about three weeks and then, the touch-screen failed. However, I hate the seller, InnoMate Digital. The company lied on two grounds (1) that I did not return accessories associated with the product and (2) that I had used the unit for so long (45 days), that IT COULD NOT RESELL THE RETURNED TELEPHONE. InnoMate's complaint alarmed me, because, it implied that, if the accessories were in the returned box (and they were), the seller would probably repair and resell the telephone, without indicating that, it was a repaired item. No company should RE-SELL AS NEW, a defective product, returned by a customer.As someone, who lived in China for many years, and still visit the country, for extended periods, I am aware that Chinese transactional legislation has not adopted the Western ideas that (1) the customer is presumed to be right, most of the time and if, s/he is not, the merchant grants the customer a benefit-of-doubt, at least, to establish good relations with the buying public; (2) Chinese merchants do not agree that, goods are returnable, within reasonable time, even if, they have been used and, especially, if the product has a defect, damage, dysfunction, or inconsistent with claims made for it.While in Shanghai, in December 2010, my friend purchased for me, a shaver, which would not work in the United States. Within ten minutes, we returned to the store, and requested an exchange, for one, with dual electric systems.The merchant demurred, insisting that, the sale was final and if, we wanted the other brand, which was more expensive by, as much, as Rmb 150, we should pay for both.I refused, called Chinese Police, and was taken to a local precinct, where a European-trained officer intervened and ""ordered"" the seller, to exchange the merchandise, by which time, we had spent an entire morning and mid-day, haggling over an issue that would have been concluded in two minutes, in Europe, Australia, Canada, and the United States.I had a similar encounter in both Nigeria and Ghana, in 2012 but, this time, I inquired, before buying.No one should buy goods, that are unreturnable; no one!","November 2, 2013",

mobile phone,It was OK but not for me,Geraldine,R113D7UUPQYDVJ,3,"I would like to start off by saying I received a different phone than what was advertised. The phone I received didn't have the TV antenna which is no big deal since I am in the US and we don't use analog TV here anymore. Also the phone ran Android 4.2 not 4.0 which is an upgrade so it was a plus.Now I researched this particular phone for weeks before I purchased it. I knew there was a risk but after reading many reviews I decided to click buy. What i received was not what i researched so I was a bit upset but the phone looked great so I tried it out for about a week.The phone itself looked very nice. It didn't feel or look cheap. The screen looks great and way better than expected. Andoid 4.2 ran flawlessly and never had any lag or freezing problems in the week I had it. I was really surprised on how great the phone ran since my expectations weren't very high. The resolution on the display was bright and sharp. Most apps worked fine.Now I will explain the bad and why I returned the phone. The camera. It's bad. I have always used my phones as my primary camera since it's always on me and I have 2 little ones so I am always snapping dozens of pictures per day. The back camera was OK in very good lighting but still one of the worst phone cameras Ive seen since having about 5 different smartphones in the past 5 years. The front facing camera was so bad it was totally not useable. I also couldn't get mms to work on the phone which could have been a service thing (straight talk.) Some apps did not run well. Youtube streamed fine but netflix would not play videos. I couldn't video chat at all with any capable app. Now what was a main deal breaker for me was the earpiece was absolutely terrible.I could barely hear anybody at the highest volume setting and it sounded very staticy. It drove me crazy. Also the person on the other line couldn't hear me very clear.So all in all I think this is a decent chinese smartphone for what you pay for. Since I take lots of pictures and use my phone to actually make phone calls it did not work for. Other than than that the display looks great, Android runs good, and most apps work fine.","November 18, 2013",

mobile phone,Advise for you,M. Schlecht,R37HPOKM0O2V5D,3,"The phone has a big screen 5 inches also Android is not so far out of date like most US phones are. I really don't get why the big companies lag so far behind. Anyways, the phone has some good points and some bad points. As all phones do this is no different. I also have some unknown things if it is my phone or the services I use. I use straight talk so it's one of the cheapest services.Pros:1. The phone comes unlocked so you can put it on any service.2. Those who like big phones like almost tablet size this is it.3. Comes with plugs for other countries besides United States mainly Asian plugs.I used these for places like Philippines.4. GSM phone so works on most anywhere except with the moron companies in United States like Sprint/Verizon.5. The clicking seems to work and the battery life even with this big of screen last one day.6. The phone is cheap and has a newer android.7. The phone is compatible with google marketplace and can load plenty of apps on it.8. Wifi works well9. Blu Tooth works as well.10. Typing is pretty good just as easy as other smartphones.11. 90% of the time no problems with anything but if you use phone as your lively hood this is not good enough.Cons:1. The phone doesn't pick up your voice unless your mouth is really close often causes hangup since android hangup is there.2. The phone's speaker is very low volume for the ear piece during a phone call, I always have it at max and still very difficult to hear.3. The phone has no way to update or root it unless you can read Chinese which is the native country. They say you can on internet nothing listed or sent to me works.4. The phone has a big problem which I don't know if this is Android fault or Phone. When you receive a call the screen goes black. Why? I want to do something so I move my face away it doesn't get bright all the time it stays dark I don't have any screen, If I hit the screen it doesn't respond. Yet other times it stays lit and I hangup on people cause mouth is next to hangup. Stupid design the hangup should be a slider to hangup your moron google. Also it's front camera perhaps is the problem detecting light or dark since it is so poor.5. The phone is unlocked but not rooted so you can't get rid of 2 Chinese crap programs only disable them also you can't install programs I consider important like firewall/some full backup tools/anti-virus.Universal Grips:(Networks or Phones)The phone has TV ability yet this is pointless in the United States we don't use analogy anymore so radio would be better.The phone plug in for power often falls this is a common theme for mini-usb it's alot of phones.The phone sometimes must be restarted or network restarted sometimes to get internet reestablished especially if you have not done that in over 2 days.The phone also sounds like robot scrambles sometimes when answering. I hangup and redial it works fine. That's been happening 1/10 phone calls. Maybe NSA who knows.Cons for Android:1. The phone often hangs up since android is so dumb to put a hang up next to your cheek. If you push your facenext to the phone to hear or speak into the mic it hangs up yet you must to hear.2. You need to design a slider for hangup also don't go dark when on phone call.3. When you put a lock on Android the phone starts up in the morning starts ticking why? Why? WHY!!!I want to know why android makes a ticking sound after it boots and drains all my battery as it doesn't turn screenoff this is when you have your phone encrypted if you don't have it encrypted the phone just starts up in the morningand screen goes black yet it ticks like a stop watch on boot if encrypted.","September 7, 2013",

I don't know where they became lost but if they would have shipped the UPS or FED EX we would not have this issue.

mobile phone,"The phone is great, the OS sucks though.",Kiet,RV76AAYWT4EYR,3,"I really liked this phone, it had great potential. I absolutely loved the camera but there were a lot of faults to this phone that I would like to address regarding the OS (Operating System) and some things I don't like.1. The music player has no search functionality, if you want to find a specific song you will have to browse through your entire library in order to find it.2. The phone needs a better camera stabilizer. Come on, it has a 41 megapixel camera and it can't use any of the extra pixels in order to maintain a stabilized footage?3. No panorama mode4. Little to no apps. The free app to paid app ratio is enormous. It's like 1 free app for every 6 paid apps.5. The headphone jack is on the top (Just something I dislike)6. The camera bumper on the back provides a really bad weight distribution causing for a very bulky phone and uncomfortable to hold if I might add.","May 27, 2013",

mobile phone,Years ahead in Camera dept but also years behind in software.,rick,RXRPBRNCAAUFG,3,"Pro: Best camera-phone out there easily. Good build quality similar to HTC one X. Nice accurate RGB OLED screen Have Camera button which most phone don't had. Good calling and speaker volume. Ovi Map, great offline maps. Can zoom 3 times in the photo galley which android and iphone can't. Pretty good battery life have nice clock for screen saver. Has removable battery and accept micro sdhc. Can play most video up to 1080p Can produce very nice video it has stabilizer.Cons: Low resolution, only 360 x 640 pixels or 188 ppi. First (2 years old)Samsung Galaxy have higher resolution. Brightness is quite weak. No sensor detect light No digital zoom is use the high pixel to crop zoom if you shoot with lower mp mode. Mislead no 41 MB mode, max is 38 MB. Front camera only can use for chat program not in camera mode. Pretty heavy (weight almost as much as Samsung Note) Video light is weak compare to Samsung Note. No Panorama mode in camera. Web browsing experience is poor (low resolution and single core) take long time to load page. Very tiny apps selection compare to Android and IOS. Very little free good apps like Microsoft. The weather widget only display Celsius Very pricey phone, cost as much as top of the in android or iPhone.Bottom line this phone is like 2 years or more in term of camera, but the software is also 2 years or more outdated compare to today phone. If this phone was release 2 years ago it will definite be a game changer, but they release this phone way too late with outdated OS and hardware. Is shame such beast camera sensor should reserved better software. Hopefully this phone will comes to window and offer more function. I only recommend this phone to you if you do not surf the web regularly or ply games, if you just type of person need to have the best camera and make calls, this is for you. If you need anything else, is not for you.","August 20, 2012",
mobile phone,"Two Stars out of the box, Five Stars after upgrades",PowderedWaterToo,R233KQRFVBEV5B,3,"*** ORIGINALLY GAVE 2 STARS with title ""Two Stars = 'I don't like it,' and that's true""; see UPDATE below ***I had the Optimus V for about a year, but had to buy a new phone because the pathetic internal memory caused the phone to reach a point of uselessness. I couldn't add any apps and reached a point where I couldn't even receive text messages.So I bought the HTC One V... (all comparisons below are to the Optimus)THE GOOD:-The internal storage is much better. For a ""power user"", it might not be enough, though. Don't be fooled by the ""4gb ROM"": there are actually only 0.94GB of available space out the box. Still, this is a major improvement over the Optimus. And of course, you can add up to 32GB of external storage.-Phone is thinner and sleeker looking, plus has a larger screen without being one of those huge tabletesque phones. Honestly, the Optimus just looks outdated next to this one-Improved camera with flash-Web browser with Flash and an option to force to desktop sites (as opposed to mobile version)-Web browser also has a ""Read"" option that makes articles much easier to read-Auto-brightness (which doesn't work that well, but is better than nothing)-Keyboard functionality (WHEN IT WORKS; see below)is greatly improved. I liked Swype in the Optimus, but more often than not it was just a pain in the ass. This phone does not have Swype; it has an advanced word recognition software that knows what you are trying to type. So if you are a sloppy typer like me who usually has to hit backspace everyother character, those days are gone. Just type away with your sloppy fingers and the phone will automatically insert the word that you meant to type, with amazing accuracy. Plus having a bigger screen and more widely spaced characters makes it easier to type accurately in the first place.-Phone automatically switches to speaker phone when you flip it overTHE BAD:-Now and then the phone will not rotate the screen when I rotate the phone. Very annoying. I will hold it there for a minute and eventually it will do it. Doesn't happen all the time, but it shouldn't happen at all.-The status bar at the top of the screen is not always visible. With the Optimus, it was always there. With the HTC, when you are looking at web pages or using certain apps, they will take the whole screen and you will not see the status bar. This might sound like a good thing, but trust me, it gets annoying. What's the time? If you want to know you have to go back to the home screen. Want to check on that download? You gotta go back to the home screen. You starting to get the picture??? (FIXED by downloading Dolphin web browser; SEE UPDATE BELOW)-Pandora has significant bugs with this phone. If you get a call, the music does not automatically resume after it (this is true with Amazon Cloud Player too). Also, if you go to a different app, you can't go back into it; it freezes then restarts when you try (doesn't happen every time, but quite often).-If you want to have a screen lock (pattern, pin, or password), then you now have the extra step of swiping a ring then doing your security method. Might not seem like a big deal, but having to do that extra step every time you enter your phone is enough to make you not even use a screen lock (I did on the Optimus; I am not with this phone because it is too much of a hassle)THE UNACCEPTABLE (both fixable; see UPDATE below):-There is a significant bug with the keyboard when using a web browser (I say ""a"", not ""the"" because I downloaded a new web browser, Dolphin, and had the same problem). The problem does not occur in apps or messaging, just web browsers. If you are writing something in the browser (I'm not talking about the URL bar) and you need to go back and delete a character, good luck! The cursor will show that it is on one letter, but it will begin erasing from a completely different spot. For example, right now I am composing a message in Yahoo Mail. I wrote ""unaccceptable."" Oops! I wrote an extra c! I better go back and delete that. So I put the cursor between the c and the e. I hit delete... what happens??? It erases the last e! I hit delete again and it erases the l! Yet, the whole time the cursor is blinking where I placed it! If you are typing and hit delete without ever moving the cursor, there is no problem. But if you are typing a long comment or email or whatever and you need to go back and change something, 9 times out of 10 you will be SOL and become so frustrated you will be ready to stomp on your phone.-You know how I mentioned in the GOOD section how the phone features an intelligent auto-complete when typing??? Well sometimes when you are writing in landscape view (i.e. with the phone sideways) the auto-complete bar hovers on top of the keyboard. So it's right in the f***ing way when you are trying to type. You are tying to type a letter and you can't avoid but to click on one of the word suggestions. If you rotate the phone to portrait view (phone upright), this corrects the problem, but then you have to work with a much smaller keyboard arrangement.-(there was a problem where the battery would not fully charge, but HTC released an update for that)To be clear, these are not problems that I just happened to have on the phone I got. I originally bought this phone from Amazon, but I ended up returning it because I figured there was a problem with my specific phone. I bought another one directly from Virgin Mobile and have the same problems.The phone has memory, so it works, unlike the Optimus it replaced. But these problems are just unacceptable for a new phone. I truly believe that Virgin Mobile gets the crappy phones that the manufacturers know have problems and want to get rid of. One hour of quality control would have caught these problems, but obviously that was not a concern.*** UPDATE (11/22/2012) ***The two ""Unacceptable"" problems are solved by installing a new keyboard and web browser. I chose SwiftKey and Dolphin, respectively, which are superior to the stock options. I won't review those apps here, but suffice it to say that they rock.If you install those two apps, this becomes a four star phone.I decided to keep pushing it. I rooted the phone and installed Tasker and ROM Toolbox. Again, I won't review these apps, but they make the phone one amazing piece of machinery.If you root the phone and install those two apps as well, this becomes a five star phone.That said, my review is for the HTC One V. It is NOT for the HTC One V with a bunch of changes made to it so that it isn't a piece of crap. My initial review was two stars. Because of the ABILITY to make it an awesome phone, I moved it up to three stars. To put it differently, you can't say ""Oh this car is perfect (five stars)... if you replace the engine and transmission."" You feel me?The phone is not as powerful as some other phones and is noticeably laggy. But the price is right, and if you are willing to put in the time, it can be made into an amazing device. After rooting the phone and installing a bunch of apps that make the phone function well, I am very happy with the product.***When signing up on Virgin Mobile, please use KickBack Code ""uYv674L0"" to get 60 free minutes bonus airtime!

mobile phone,So so,maxfli,R13070O8L0GTO1,3,"Good deal since it's a no-contract phone thru Virgin Mobile for only $35 per month. Battery charging problems as noted by many others, fixed with re-boots. Far too much preloaded junk. Scrolling on web pages is irratating as the task bar pops up and obscures a lot of the screen. I really do like the Tune-In radio feature however and the battery life is good vs. other phones I've had. It's a good interim phone for now.","November 11, 2012",
mobile phone,"Wonderful at first, but over time it slowly died.",GMAN94,R19HS6JEFAEHG4,3,"I purchased this item December of last year, and for the first six months it was wonderful. After that HTC sent out a software update which my phone automatically installed. With this update I can't move most of my apps to my 32 gig micro SD card, so my phone's internal storage is full all of the time. The keyboard will show up, but won't let me input text about 3/4 of the time. Calls won't go through for about a minute after I dial them, call quality has dropped significantly (especially with Verizon phones it seems).Bottom line - If you get this phone, make absolutely sure it doesn't download the software update.

mobile phone,Decent budget smartphone but has cons,"Brett G. ""mindwideopen""",R3EF6920DGBV39,3,"I've had this phone for about a year now and as others have said the problem with the phone is it's slow. The phone is ok but do not expect it to be as fast as more expensive phones with a better processor. It does not have a dual core processor even, only a single. Most budget smartphone manufacturers now try and hide that in their phone specs or they try to not list it at all so you have to dig to get the info sometimes. It takes ok pics and video but again nothing groundbreaking. Some apps run horrible on it but a lot of the main ones like Google maps, Spotify, Facebook, and Yelp will work ok for the most part. Which is the reason I think it deserves at least 3 stars I suppose. Also another con is the Sprint network that it uses. They just haven't been able to expand their network enough. Don't expect to do a lot of video streaming or gaming on it trust me.","January 16, 2014",

I do not recommend for buyers that want a good quality and long lasting phone. I dont understand why it's curved at the bottom, this makes no sense. I do like how reasonable thr price is. You get what you paid for for about the first five or six months. Thats when the phone slows down and starts requiring a restart every two hours. Withthis phone, to save contacts, pictures, or download applications your HTC One V will need a sd card which doesnt come with so you will have to purchase seperately. Plus the pictures all come out orangish pinkish tinted, nit natural looking.

mobile phone,OK for the price,"M. Soto ""Michael""",R34Z7589U9SXC,3,"I picked up this phone when it was on super sale over Christmas knowing that I would be sacrificing some convenience for the price. Since it is my phone, I know how to handle it, but if I ever hand it over to a friend to send a text or look up directions, they throw their hands in the air and give up because it lags so much.I generally manage the lagging by making sure to close out programs that I am not using rather than letting them run in the background, and I restart the phone at least once a day to clear out the memory. This is something iPhone users are appalled that I put up with, but again, I paid very little for the phone, and my monthly phone bills are about a third what they pay.Lately, I've been having more problems with basic functions of the phone like making phone calls and sending text messages. I'll have to tap a contact's name two or three times before it'll actually make the call or take me to the texting screen.A friend of mine recently picked up a cheap LG Phone with a slower processor running an older version of Android, and I've found that his phone runs much more smoothly than mine. I imagine this may be because his cheaper phone respects its limitations, whereas the HTC One V tries to do all of the things that a higher-end Android phone can do, but it just doesn't have the processing power or memory to handle it.Aside from that, I really like the styling and materials, I like that it fits more easily in my pocket than most current smart phones, and the screen is crisp and clear.

mobile phone,Not an Incredible,C. Kiefer,R2FNPBTK6GSVUP,3,"Having upgraded from the HTC Droid Incredible six months ago, I am pretty disappointed in the HTC One V. It's the same size as the Incredible, but with an angled ""chin."" Visually, they look so similar that I can't help but compare them. Overall, I feel that this model is like the 3-4 year old Incredible, but one that has been stripped bare of certain features. If I was still using Verizon, I'd simply by a new battery and switch back to my old HTC Incredible. This phone feels intentionally hobbled by the manufacturer in order to justify the price point. I want to remain an HTC fan, but am finding it difficult.Pros:1) Small size fits easily in pocket2) The ""chin"" design gives the phone an asymetricality that makes the phone easy to orient (front/back/top/bottom) in the dark.3) Good camera (much improved)Cons:1) Missing the ""menu"" hardware button. Some apps are designed for a menu button, and not having one renders certain apps useless.2) Missing my favorite app--the HTC news RSS feed! HTC, you spent the hard work of creating the app, why would you purposely exclude it from later models?3) The alarm function is buggy--it only seems to buzz about 40% of the time. Ironically, if the phone is in deep sleep, it can't even wake itself up to wake me up! (I've had to buy an old fashioned alarm clock for my business trips! Are you kidding me?)4) The software regularly lags bigtime--even when using simple apps like text messaging. It often closes back to the home screen in the middle of typing.5) Battery held a charge well for the first 6 months, but I feel like it's quickly fading fast. Worse still, the battery is embedded in the case, and cannot be replaced.","May 25, 2013",
mobile phone,Well........,Zach,R2M3JLDQRMZXY3,3,"I initially purchased this phone for the primary purpose of completing transactions with Square. While it does that without too much of a fight, using as my daily phone has been quite a challenge. I for one am not a big fan of HTC Sense 4, and my battery life and data speeds were held back by the stock OS build (download speeds almost NEVER exceeded 300kbps even in a full coverage zone!). Thankfully, HTC makes it easy (and yes, it's legal) to unlock the bootloader and put a custom ROM onto the device. I traded the modest reliability of the stock build for much better battery life and data speeds that are much more useful (1.5mbps down).Overall, it has been an ongoing labor to try and make this phone fulfill my wants. For the cost of the device, I suppose it's a bit unreasonable to expect more from it. So in the end, it's left a sort of ""blah..."" impression with me.***Loading a custom ROM can render your device completely unusable (""brick"" it), and should only be attempted if you are willing to fully assume that risk.","May 24, 2013",

Landscape mode stopped working after only one month, or it suddenly went into landscape mode without moving the phone, and at inconvenient times. The ""chin"" that juts out at the bottom of the phone made it a little awkward to hold while typing a text in landscape mode (for the brief time it actually worked).The signal cuts in and out, making the phone even slower when trying to get some internet action. Lots of dropped calls too. I don't live in some small town either - every major wireless carrier has towers around here. Lots of dead spots in spite of that fact.Sometimes the alarm doesn't work, so I'm back to the old clock radio by the bed in use since the 80's. Applications seem to open by themselves when the phone is not in use no matter how careful I am about closing out of everything before locking the screen.Sometimes I will get a text message from someone 24 hours after they sent it. I have a friend on Virgin Mobile with a different phone, and he says that happens to him as well.Still, I give it three stars because overall the phone has increased my capabilities over my previously un-smart phone, and the photos are pretty good quality.","April 4, 2013",

mobile phone,A good phone--for a little while,eternitybound,R13EFK039S5IJS,3,"February 2013:I have had this phone for over 6 months now. It cost twice as much as the present price, back then! It has not locked up or froze a single time during use. The battery lasts all day, the services work great. The sound is great and signal strength is adequate. It is slim and fits easily in my pocket. The camera works well, but of course you cannot turn off the shutter sound. I am pleased with this phone.UPDATE January 2014: This phone, ended up only lasting 16 months before it started behaving erratically and needed to be replaced. Mainly, the phone would open apps on its own, and the keyboard would type on its own, interfering with being able to use the phone effectively. Definitely not worth the cost for such a short life span.","February 8, 2013",

mobile phone,Major upgrade for a no contract phone - wifi connection problem,iowa,R19DQEND01GLEW,3,"This phone replaced our HTC Wildfire S. Fabulous upgrade. First and foremost for us - much longer battery life. Also this one can accept a storage upgrade card, previous one would not. Superior operating system, for us with one major reservation. Have a software problem that effected our WiFi connection. Its a software problem with the phone. HTC has tried to help us resolve the issue but it's still not totally resolved. A question arose whether the new phone's battery could be removed/replaced. Still no answer on that. If it cannot be replaced that could be a problem for long term use. If it can be replaced, it is not easy and there are no instructions for it.Rating would be 5 star if we didn't have the unresolved wifi problem even if battery is permanent.","January 23, 2013",
mobile phone,Nearly perfect 3G Android SmartPhone is crippled by inability to change battery when needed.,DR-J-J,R2GS2SXYCFWL9,3,"I think this phone is a 5 star phone in a 1 star design. Don't get me wrong, the phone itself is beautiful... but the mechanical designers of the phone did not allow for changing the battery. A major problem in my book. I took my 5 star ranking and 1 star design ranking and came up with a 3 star review.I purchased this phone on sale when my phone was losing its battery. The battery just won't keep a charge after about 15 months (my original phone, I meant). In my hurry, I didn't notice that the HTC One V doesn't have a battery door... it was designed to be pitched when the battery fails. Well, if that battery lasts for 15 months (like my current samsung phone did), then I made a bad buying decision. But, should this HTS last 2 or 3 years, it is more tolerable for the price paid.What I don't know is if this Phone's battery can be changed at the service center for HTC or Virgin Mobile??? That would make me up my review rating, if that is a possiblity. This is a great little (well, 3.7"") phone. One flaw: Can't replace the battery when you need to.I will update my review if I find a way to replace the battery.JJ","December 27, 2012",
mobile phone,HTC One V review,"Dr. J ""jam""",R21XFK18DEK6JZ,3,I have had this phone for about 3 weeks having upgraded from Froyo. I am impressed with the list of features on the phone. It is very lightweight and seems to work flawlessly with most of the applications that I have used so far. I have tethered this with Easy Tether Pro and was able to connect to the internet with my computer. Some negatives are however applications from the play store download very slowly through the 3g connection compared to my previous LG phone that had less memory. My old phone came with a menu button and HTC has eliminated this in favor of one that launches views of open applications. The application menu icon on the screen is very difficult to work with. The calculator is not set in the correct font and is only partially viewable.I would recommend this for the individual who does not intend to replace their notebook with this phone.Downgrading my edit of my previous review at week 4. My battery does not charge fully. I am returning this for a replacement as the battery needs to be replaced at a service center and is not user accessible.,"September 8, 2012",
mobile phone,Switching back to LG,marianat,R29KNDWY425AWQ,3,"I've had this phone for about a year, and what a long year it's been. Initially, it worked great. It was fast and the graphics were great compared to my old optimus v. After a few months, it started to lag. I never really have many apps that I install, though it's capable of storing quite a few before I ran out of space. After a factory reset, it was good as new, only to have the same lag happen again.Then it started going downhill from there. My phone began freezing and not shutting off. The same song would skip over and over, like back in the olden days when CDs didn't work correctly. Oh, the flashbacks. I've never dropped my phone enough to give it 'brain damage', besides that it's taking much longer to charge now.Aside from that, it constantly drops my wifi. Even while my tablet and laptop going at the same time, my phone is the only one to disconnect constantly. Compared to all other phones I've had, this was the worst. Glad I ordered a new phone today.","March 9, 2014",

mobile phone,Kind of wish I never bought.....,A. Stewart,R107T3DGTAZOWI,3,"This phone is not exactly what I thought it would be, and I made sure to read a lot of product reviews before buying. Unfortunately no one ever said anything negative about it, so i am wondering about the validity of the reviews that I read....The phone does have nice graphics. It does have all the bells and whistles that a techno-geek would need. I would say that it has too many, and as such is bloated with too many apps. And it is relatively easy to use.My biggest gripes?1) Every once in a while when you have the phone inverted and are typing a message your keyboard disappears and you get a double text box, and no keyboard (unless you flip the phone back). The only way to get rid of that is to re-boot your phone.2) You can put an icon for your phone contacts, but they never appear when they call or they text you. You have to know their numbers, Doesn't even say that 'so and so is calling' like my old phones. It does show an icon when you text them, but when they reply it comes up as 'unknown'. After looking more into it my friend found blogs from people stating the same problems and long, convoluted possibilities on how to POSSIBLY fix the problem (getting a card to take some of the bloat off the phone).3)When you turn on the phone you have 5 screens to fill- #3 being the 'main screen'. I have found that in the past three months since I have had this the 'main screen' drifts and stays in the 'number c2' position. I then have to go into my settings app and re-do everything. A pain in the ass- let me tell you.4) camera ain't that good. Video quality is better, but not by much.I am getting frustrated with this phone to the point that I am looking to buy another. And after only a few months. My old phones I had for a couple of years each. This?Meh..... I wouldn't recommend it to anyone.","February 9, 2013",

When stacking the price of this unit up against others it was obvious that it would come up short when stacked against an iPhone or Samsung Galaxy. But this phone didn't even reach my pedestrian expectations.This phone is virtually worthless when driving. The voice recognition software on board is a joke. It has yet to make the proper call.The keyboard is, at best, difficult to operate in either portrait or landscape mode.

mobile phone,"Acceptable phone, unacceptable service","J B W ""jweakman""",R34S0X7XY98NDD,3,"First let me say that I've used Virgin Mobile service for a number of years for my old basic flip phone, and never had too many complaints. I live in an area with good VM coverage so I didn't think I'd have any issues with upgrading to a smart phone and keeping VM as my provider. So after pondering it for a few months, I decided to go with the HTC One V phone.It's a good little phone. Easy to use, and it comes preloaded with most of the apps I use frequently (Facebook, Gmail, etc.) I hadn't used an Android phone before, mainly I've used my husband's iPhone. The interface is similar, but perhaps a bit clunkier on the HTC. I didn't like that the apps had a seperate button to press to access them on a different screen. At times it made navigating seem choppy but for the price I wasn't going to complain about that. Internet was good, I didn't find it to be too slow. Call quality was good as well.What wasn't acceptable was Virgin Mobile's service--I could send, but not receive texts from anyone. VM customer service response was to tell me to just keep waiting; wait four more hours, wait five more days, wait, wait, wait. I know you get what you pay for and a lot of people might accept these glitches but I was really irritated by it. It made me feel as though I'd never be able to know for sure if I was EVER receiving all the texts I was supposed to be receiving. A Google search revealed that there were plenty of other people who had the same issues with VM service, even going back a number of years. I could not trust this phone with VM as a provider, so back it went to Amazon and I painfully coughed up the money for an iPhone with AT&T.; And guess what? I've never missed a text.","September 7, 2012",
mobile phone,Nice phone but problem with voice clarity,Bill Green,RGXV0V3Z24MPY,3,"Bought this phone from RS for 100 dollars for use on Virgin network. Overall the phone was about what I expected in this price range as far as processor performance and overall performance. Wifi worked quite well.Battery life seemed to be pretty good. I live in South Jersey area so signal strength varied on Virgin's network,sometimes real strong with 3G and other times no bars showing at all,but I could still make a call even with no bars. One problem that I ran into was the keyboard was just a tad too small,would hit the wrong letter a lot. The other problem was voice clarity. A couple times had to ask people to repeat what they just said,because I couldn't make it out. Voice clarity is actually better on the 2 twenty dollar Tracfones I have,and one of them is a 10 year old Nokia candybar type. Even tried a few calls on speakerphone and they still sounded a little muffled. I don't know if the problem is with the phone itself or Virgin's network. I could have lived with the keyboard problem but I ended up returning the phone due to the voice clarity issue. This is the first time I tried a smartphone so I guess I'll just stick with the Tracfone for now. I definetly want to get a no contract smartphone eventually. I'm thinking maybe I'll get 4s Iphone in 6 months or so from Virgin if the price drops a little by then. The RS salesman said that Virgin was having some issues with I phones right now,maybe they'll have it figured out by then. I would prefer a phone with a smaller size screen like the One v or iphone. Would have rated this phone 4 stars if not for the voice issue.","February 26, 2013",
mobile phone,My Review of the HTC One V,Bryan Leichter,R13LDJQPDLCXQL,3,"I've recently gotten the HTC One V as a replacement for my last phone, the Motorola Triumph. Although the Triumph and the One V are in the same price range, they are nowhere near the same device. The Triumph has a few things the One V doesn't, for example, a front facing camera,an .3 inch larger screen, and an HDMI slot. In most other areas, the HTC One V is victorious. Motorola phones are a strange breed. There are some excellent Motorola phones out their, like the Droid Razr Maxx. But there are also a ton of sub par phones out there. The problem is, Motorola just makes far too many phones. The Motorola Triumph is one of the victims of this model. By comparison, the HTC One V is available from multiple carriers, and is not just a model that was put out there to be the ""Virgin Mobile model"". From a design standpoint, these phones are largely different. The Motorola Triumph isn't far from looking like a brick. It's very square, and isn't exactly ugly, but it's one of the more plain looking phones out there. The HTC One V, however, is a beautiful, fairly thin phone. It's the same with as an iPod touch, although about twice as thick, and the screen is closer to a 16:9 ratio, just like the newly released iPhone 5. And like the iPhone 5, the HTC One V is a unibody design, except for the small part at the bottom that can be opened and a Mini-SD card can be inserted. Compare that to the Motorola Triumph. I've had two of them, and on both of them, the pesky battery door kept falling off the back. In fact, one time the door fell off and I ended up losing my Micro SD card. The operating system on the Motorola Triumph is 2.2 Froyo, where-as the operating system on the One V is 4.0 Ice Cream Sandwich. In those 2 generations of updates, there are quite a bit of differences between these 2 phone operating systems. The reason the Triumph never got updated past 2.2 is presumably because Motorola doesn't see it worth their time to port the newer updates to this phone. I've mentioned earlier that the display on the Triumph is bigger. This is true, but I did notice that on the One V, the colors are more vibrant. The color red, especially, pops right off the screen. The rear camera on the Triumph is not very good. While the one on the One V isn't the greatest either, it's definitely quite better. And the included shutter and aperture settings make it possible to get a pretty good picture in low light even without using the flash. This is a good thing to hear for video, wherein the flash wouldn't be of use anyway. I did notice that the Motorola Triumph had superb audio quality in the voice recording department. I was quite surprised that I could get such great sound out of my phone. And when I tried my One V's voice recording feature, it didn't quite stack up. At least not at first. I realized after a bit that the One V has a more sensitive microphone, which causes it to over-modulate very easily. Because of this, I found that the best way to record sound on this phone is to hold the phone at least 2 feet away from your face. HTC Sense is included in all HTC Android phones. Personally I have found it marginally useful, something I could take or leave. The audio on the Triumph is fairly good to begin with, but the Beats Audio Technology exclusive to HTC phones is amazing. The HTC One V is available from US Cellular, Virgin Mobile, and Cricket. The Motorola Triumph is exclusive to Virgin Mobile.","January 13, 2013",
mobile phone,Its alright for the price,Jose V. Perez,R3734FS7GL6U62,3,The samsung galaxy s3 is by far the superior device. But on the other hand the price of the HTC One V makes up for the preformance.,"December 25, 2012",
mobile phone,Virgin Mobile users pass on this,Christopher T Foose,R9FYRPO7Q4G4,3,"Currently I am on a grandfathered Virgin Mobile plan. That means as long as I keep using my LG Optimus V I can stay on the $25 ""unlimited"" plan. Their plan is not truly unlimited as they throttle data when you hit the 2.5 GB mark. However, you can get through this by topping up again.I mention this because Virgin Mobile has long done away with their Unlimited text and data plan for $25 and has bumped rates to $35 for my type of plan. If I didn't have the grandfathered option I would drop VM for another carrier. They had cited the 4G network as the reason for the price increase and if you keep to a current list of 3G phones you could keep your $25 a month rate.The HTC V One is a 3G phone. However, if I wanted to transfer my services to it I would be giving up the $25 a month plan and have to pay $35 instead. For a phone without 4G capability causing this type of price increase it is not worth it.The retail price is too high for this type of limited hardware. I bought this phone during a RadioShack special for $50 which included $10 back in credit. Even paying this price for it I have second thoughts of whether it was a good buy.Here are some good aspects to this phone.It records video in HD quality. I considered buying a Flipcam, however, I never did because that product is not longer being made and eventually will stop being supported. This is an excellent alternative. The video quality is very decent.As a music player it is great. Audio sounds great. Supposedly there is Beats Audio technology included in the phone however I have heard that this doesn't really do much besides compress the audio.If you can get VOIP working on the phone it is a great extra handset. The build is sleek and slim. The glass feels smooth and incredibly sturdy and scratch resistant.As for the hardware tweakers who want to install a custom rom you will be severely disappointed especially if you wish to use the camcorder and camera aspects of the phone,. When using this it does crash a lot. I have heard that it is due to propietary information that HTC has not released to developers. I have also heard that the auto-focus crashes the phone. The custom roms I have tried have all been JellyBean based and have had these identical problems. Since I really want this as a video recorder I reverted to a modified version of the stock rom. That means I am using Ice Cream Sandwich, which is okay.Also, I want to mention that this device is a pain to root and install custom roms. If you are looking to modify this hardware for your specifications I would pass.The small display is really good and crisp. I love looking at pictures and watching YouTube videos on this handset.Overall I like having a small sleek device to take pictures and video with. However I recommend that most people pass on this particular phone. The main reasons being that it lacks 4G capability and is limited when it comes to modifying. HTC might release a JellyBean update for this but I wouldn't count on it.So... pass.. do not buy.","January 4, 2013",

mobile phone,The most basic things soured an otherwise great phone,Amazon Customer,R3A7D1TVOYRWRS,3,"The two complaints I have about the phone should be non-issues for any phone.1) Frequent reboots for no reason.

Touch it for 1 millisecond and the phone wakes up. Touch it for 2 milliseconds and the phone powers off. And the power switch is VERY sensitive.If I can keep the phone on when I want it to be on, I am very happy with it. I love that I can get over the air radio stations (they should advertise that feature and make the software for it more easily available), and that there are lots of cases available. I didn't buy it for the 3D camera, I knew that was just gimmicky. It works just ok.

My first HTC EVO V had a dead pixel so I had to return it, my second HTC EVO V had a dead pixel and the vibrate function did not work so I had to return that one!, the third phone had another dead pixel in the screen. I am now on my 4th HTC EVO V and I'm very disappointed!. I constantly get this notification titled ""Radio Interference"" it doesn't matter where I am or what time it is, this notification pops up randomly and when it pops up, I can't send or receive messages or even call. I've done research on this problem and it seems to be something that is wrong with this particular phone. It's a deal break for me, especially when I am waiting on calls from work and the ""Radio Interference"" notification is on my phone I can't receive any calls, then an hour later I have a voicemail that I had no idea even existed. Besides all that this phone has alot of pro's. The camera is pretty good and the 3D is fun to play around with. The Android 4.0 OS is very easy to use and highly customizable with apps!. The battery life is decent, it depends on what you do on your phone for that day. If you use it for only texting and have your screen at 50% it will last you a whole day. High end games from the app store seem to run pretty good. Overall I'd give this phone about 3 out of 5 stars. If it wasn't for all the problems I had when first purchasing the phone and the constant ""Radio Interference"" notifications this phone would be perfect. I wouldn't recommend this phone, i'd save up for a better one because from my experience it's pretty much like rolling the dice, there is a 50-50 chance you will get a decent phone or a bad one with either dead pixel problems or the vibrate function not working or even the very frustrating ""Radio Interference problem"".","December 1, 2012",
mobile phone,"Seemed great at first, but maybe I got a dud",DJ Apoc,RPBOX1JURYLX8,3,"At first, this seemed like the best phone I could get from Virgin Mobile. I did not particularly care for HTC's Sense UI, but found it workable with some tweaks.Unlike the other, lower end Android offerings from Virgin, the PCD Venture, and the Chaser, this is a much better quality phone. The build quality is decent for the price, and it feels good in the hand. It has a tendency to get warm, but not uncomfortably so. It's reasonably fast, and the 3D display looks fantastic, although it strains the eyes.I loved it for a couple of days, when suddenly I began getting ""SMS errors"". The next day, the phone simply refused to make or receive any phone calls, even with full bars, despite several restarts, and restores. I was sad to have to let this one go, but maybe I got a dud. Worth giving a shot if the gimmick of a 3D display seems worth it to you. I ended up settling happily on the Samsung Reverb after this.","October 25, 2012",
mobile phone,Best Android on Virgin Mobile with some reservations,Kurotch,R2F49TIJG8BDLC,3,This is my very first android phone and must say the learning curve is greater than an iPhone but i like this better. My only problem is what other customers had already said.... Delayed text messages... Phone doeskin ring or cant make call out... Even error messages.... But my phone seems to have stabilized as for the past month and a half it has been operating normally or minor glitches. Usually a power reset would fix the problem but during the initial phase i would pull the battery. I assumed due to my massive amounts of app downloads this may have caused my phone to lose it mind but it appears to be a false assumption. With all that being said i would give this phone three and 1/2 star if i could because of all the issues listed above. If i could do this all over again i would buy a GSM phone from Google or amazon and sign up for some of the new pre paid service providers that i didn't know about until this past month. As i some times travel internationally GSM service is readily available vs Virgins CDMA network.,"October 5, 2012",
mobile phone,Too expensive,Alcinda49,R1VUW1X9M0M0UO,3,I found the same phone at virgin mobile for a lot less money. I found the phone for $189.00. So l am choosing to buy it else where.,"December 18, 2012",
mobile phone,"Nice phone, but terrible service (no 3G, no calls) from Virgin Mobile","my2cents ""my2cents""",RNIWW7X5D0BJB,3,"This would've been an excellent no-contract phone. Have only had it three days and two of the days I've had no 3G or even telephone service from Virgin Mobile. Other than that the phone itself has great features and works flawlessly on wi-fi. With no phone service from Virgin Mobile (or very undependable at best) I'd need to have a backup phone if I were to keep this thing. A couple years ago I also tried Virgin Mobile and it was horrible. Thought I'd give them one more try - lured in by this nice android. I'm surprised they are still in business - taking people's money and not providing the service. There should be a class action lawsuit for sure.UPDATE: After pursuing the issue further with Virgin Mobile, I now have phone and 3G service. I didn't make any modifications to the phone on my end - it was something at their end. So, I am changing my review to 3*, instead of 1*. If Virgin Mobile continues to provide the service I pay for in the next few months, I will update the review again and add another star or two.10/10/12 - LAST UPDATE: I'm returning this phone. Still have no service at all - for days in a row. Just took a trip and had no phone or internet the entire time (in Chicago area). I am a VERY light user - average 25 calls per month, 1 or 2 texts per month max, and internet usage is very low also because I mostly use wi-fi, yet Virgin Mobile can't even supply this minimal amount of service.","September 17, 2012",
mobile phone,My speaker is cracking :(,Kay P.,R2B91WN7PRY9IG,3,"I like everything about this phone except the fact my speaker crackles and the phone is brand new. I googled the issue and it is a problem for the Evo, I am assuming the Evo V same thing. If Im using an app like voxer or even when replaying my home videos it crackles. I tried lowering the volume and it helped with the voxer app, but then I can't hear too well. I would replace it but with my luck I feel I would have the same problem with the next phone.. Ugh.. I am not sure if I want to chance it, so I might just return it to Radio Shack where I got it.","September 7, 2012",
mobile phone,Key Lock should require a password,Kamiyama,R3URR95AUCD2BS,3,"First off, I want to say that in terms of functionality, this is the BEST phone I have ever had. It is the first phone I have had that has both a USB and microSD card that lets you load your own apps onto it - plus it has a large screen, a qwerty keyboard, wifi, and triple minutes for life. For 30 bucks I don't think you could possibly get anything better.The *one* problem with it is how easy it is to unlock the phone. There are two ways - one by pressing the left softkey and the okay button, which are right next to each other and could easily be mashed together if the phone gets bumped in your pocket. The other way is by pressing 0 three times and then either the left softkey or the okay button, which dials 911.This is a major inconvenience for me, because I like to keep my phone in my pocket and I don't want it coming unlocked or dialing random numbers without me knowing. I wish phones today came with an option to set a password for key lock that would prevent accidental unlocking from bumping the phone around. If I could lock the keys with a 4-digit number, I would have given the phone a 5 star rating. Seriously this is a stupid, stupid, stupid design flaw. Modern cell phones should come with this option as standard.","November 14, 2012",
mobile phone,Beware: It calls 911 even when key pad is locked!,A. Tsang,RMCESSWCCIZXI,3,"I had high hopes for this phone and do like it mostly, but my big problem with this phone is a HUGE one. With the keypad locked, the phone has called the equivalent of 911 on about 12 occasions. Each time the phone was in my bag, not being touched and the keypad was locked. Imagine having the sheriff's office calling you back asking if you need emergency assistance. Once, my two year old son was having a total meltdown in the car with me as my phone, which was in my bag on the passenger seat of the car, took it upon itself to make a 911 call. The 911 operator heard that. They called me back a few times and when I answered the call, they questioned me - while my son was still having a melt-down. Try explaining that everything is fine to a 911 operator when they heard your child screaming in the background?! And it's never the same number dialed, when I look on the call log. Sometimes it's 112. Sometimes it's 0000. Sometimes it's 121. Sometimes it's 7334. There is no rhyme or reason to this.I like the rest of the phone features and don't have any issues with it - EXCEPT the 911 calling. This makes me afraid to keep the phone on or handle it wrong so that a button gets pushed and calls 911. I have no idea how to fix this problem.","October 2, 2012",
mobile phone,Good but has some major glitches,Jeremy McCracken,RTPLRXLYGLBBE,3,"First and foremost, this is a Tracfone phone, and I would highly recommend that you use a carrier other than Tracfone. It was a pain to get my service switched from my old phone to this one, and their tech support isn't good at all. If you're thinking of buying this phone, you should check if other prepaid carriers use the same model (and remember than Net10 and StraightTalk are both owned by Tracfone).For the most part, this is a great phone. The first thing I noticed about it was its size and weight- this is by far the thinnest and lightest phone I've ever held. It's a good bit lighter than smaller Tracfone models, and it's about a quarter of the weight of an Evo Shift 4G. It's also very thin; it's barely 3/8"" thick.The wifi antenna works very well (it seems to have an easier time finding hotspots than the aforementioned Evo Shift). The screen is fairly low-res (for the cost and size, it's worth it), but it's still easy to read. The menus are straight-forward; you'd be able to figure out most of its functions without a manual (which is good, because they don't send you one).That being said, there are a number of small issue that can be a real problem. Added together, they're bad enough that I knocked two stars off what would have been a five-star review:1) When the phone locks, it's unlocked by pushing one soft key, then the other. It turns out that it's very easy for those buttons to get pressed in the correct order in a pocket. Twice in the first day I'd owned it, I pulled it out of my pocket to find the browser open. (And yes, I locked it before putting it in my pocket.) There's a phone password option, but it only prompts for the password when the phone turns on, not when it unlocks. Buying a belt holster is *mandatory* with this phone.2) The USB port (which is used for charging) is clunky. When you insert a cord, it feels like it's in before it's fully inserted- it hangs up on the inside of the port, feeling like it's bottomed out. This is especially true with the included charger- if the cord moves around and the screen doesn't light when you plug it in, it's not in all the way, and it's not charging.3) The space bar types two spaces when you press it. It appears to have two buttons under the keyboard piece, and each one registers separately. The problem is, the space bar is about the width of a thumb, so pushing just one side is a real pain. It becomes especially annoying because the autocorrect turns double spaces into new sentences (changing it to a period and a space, and capitalizing the next letter), so you end up using the backspace key a lot in text messages.4) This is the worst one. There's a glitch in the phone's internal operating system: If you set the dialing display font to anything larger than ""small"", it starts wrapping numbers to a second line if you manually dial a long enough number. However, once it skips down a line, it moves the text insertion point back a space, so that the numbers you're typing are inserted in the middle. I found this out when I went to test the phone on my home phone, and dialed a wrong number; by watching the screen, I saw what it was doing. It doesn't do this on the small font (though a typical phone number won't wrap down a line in this font, anyway), and it doesn't do this if you start with a one (must be the auto-hyphenation). If you live in an area with an area code overlay, thus meaning you always dial ten digits, you're stuck with small font for dialing; it can be difficult to read unless you hold the phone fairly close to your face.","November 27, 2012",
mobile phone,Best tracfone I've ever had but...,A. Wiersch,R29TWJ92BYQJ7M,3,"I'll make this review fairly brief, only mentioning the major pluses and minuses.Pros:* The Samsung S390G is the best Tracfone I've ever had and I've been using Tracfone for years. My wife and I now both have one.* The screen is nice and basic functions are fast.* Size, weight, and battery life are very good.* Wi-Fi enables browser use without using up minutes/units, but I don't know how one could stand using the web browser on this phone except in emergencies. One nice thing I do like about it is that I can now check the weather radar when I'm out, but I'd never use it for ""normal"" browsing.* No complaints about sound quality like with other Tracfones I've had.* I was able to transfer my phone number, minutes, and service days from my old Tracfone to the S390G using the Tracfone website.* Cheap: The cost for me with Tracfone comes out to less than $8/month on average, including all taxes, fees, and phone costs (all prepaid).Cons:* MAJOR: Minus 1.5 stars for not being able to change the right soft key from being the 'Browser'. It's too easy to accidentally press it and waste minutes. I worry about it accidentally getting pressed and the phone staying in the browser for a long period of time. My wife complains about this too. It's really unfortunate because otherwise I'd probably rate this phone 5 stars for what it is (a good voice & texting phone).* Too easy to press space bar and get the "". "" instead of just a space. I think it's too sensitive. If you have this problem, try quickly pressing the space bar on the side instead of the center. If you hold it down longer, it inserts a period then a space. This is suppose to be a time saver but I find it more annoying that anything else.* My phone seems to have turned off by itself at least two times. My wife, who has had this phone longer than I, said the same thing happened to her when she first got it, but it doesn't happen anymore. For now, I'll assume that this is some automated update process and that this behavior will stop (I'm fairly certain that it wasn't due a low battery condition). If this behavior doesn't stop, then I'll update this review. If you know more about this, then please comment.Overall, 3.5 stars, rounded up to 4.UPDATE 2013-06-30: I'm knocking .5 stars off because these phones make it too easy to call 911 by accident. Both my wife and I have locked our phones, but they have still called 911 on several occasions... we get a call back saying to lock our phones to prevent this, but locking them doesn't work as they still allow 911 calls.","October 6, 2012",
mobile phone,Deducts Minutes when not being used.,Donna V,R1N2D4W6MYXKGC,3,"It really is a nice phone, easy to handle, comfortable. I like the scroll button, once I got used to it. I have had a problem with the browser and have been in contact with tracfone. They put some codes into the phone and said give it a chance. Well, now it's too late to send back the phone and it's still not fixed!The problem: I will have the phone on LOCK, wifi is OFF, NOT in browser, phone is sitting, yes sitting on my desk not in my hands, and it will deduct minutes frequently and say login failed. If this could be fixed and I could get clear, easy to understand directions ( for dummies) on setting up and using the browser/wifi than I would problably love the phone.","October 30, 2013",
mobile phone,"As ""smart"" as a Tracfone gets; nice keyboard, but obnoxious in its flaws","Amazon Customer ""robotech_master_01""",R2DRWFG3PPQMRJ,3,"So, the thumb keyboard is nice to have for writing text messages. That's the biggest benefit of this phone. If you do a lot of texting but don't need the processing power of a smartphone, this might be a good choice for you--except for its tragic flaws.Although it looks kind of like a smartphone, it's really just an ordinary candy bar phone with a better keyboard, and the ability to hook to wifi so you don't burn your minutes browsing the web over its pitiful built-in browser. Note that although Gmail is on the bookmarks menu of the built-in browser, you can't actually load it. Install the mobile version of Opera, it works much better. And the mobile Facebook application you can get for this phone is surprisingly good--the only downloadable app I actually ended up using very much apart from Opera.That being said, the phone has a couple of major drawbacks. One, as many other reviews have noted, is the unfortunate tendency to butt-dial or pocket-dial 911 EVEN WHEN THE KEYS ARE LOCKED. If you punch 000 or 112 or perhaps some other keyboard combinations, even through lock, it will ask you if you want to dial 911. And if you then mash the enter key, it will dial it. I got called back by 911 a couple of times while this phone rode in my pocket. It's really embarrassing to be asked if you're under duress when you tell them it was an accident! And even turning it off isn't necessarily any protection--I've had this phone TURN ITSELF ON in my pocket before.The other big problem I noticed is minor by comparison, but still annoying. When you call a number that asks you to spell something out using the letters that are normally affixed to phone number buttons, there's no way to know how to do it--these buttons aren't labeled with the right letters. If there's some way to call up on the screen what letters correspond to what numbers, I don't know what it is.If you're going to text or email a lot, and plan to keep this phone somewhere OTHER than a pocket, this phone could be useful. If not, you'd probably be best off going with something else.","September 23, 2013",
mobile phone,Pocket dialing 911 is not good,"P.Q. ""fpkwaile""",RZAOKGSQ44Z6B,3,"I purchased this product about a year ago. The wifi worked great and I really loved the full keyboard for texting. All around good phone, except for two things.1. It takes 30 seconds to lock on it's lowest setting. If I put the phone in my pocket too soon, it may not lock properly. I managed to solve this by getting a cell phone case.2. Even when the phone is locked I can pocket dial 911, which is not acceptable to me. I'm selling mine and getting an lg840g. I can deal with most quirks on a phone but I don't like pocket calling 911. Within the past 3 months this has happened about 10 times.","September 23, 2013",
mobile phone,"some good qualities, some bad",samuel,R2J4EFC2WJ0NBW,3,"I got this phone last week and I've been using it for about 4 days now. I bought it from amazon for the features and the price. I read the reviews about it ghost dialing emergency and was worried about that but managed to find a way around it. there are several number combinations which will dial emergency on this phone (911, 112, 000) and possible others. so I found to prevent this you cannot carry this in a pocket with any other hard objects such as keys, pens, coins, wallets. basically I just designate one pocket for this phone and everything seems to be fine. I carry it around all day at work doing hotel maintenance. if you throw it in a purse with other hard objects it will probabally ghost dial when moved around, so you could maybe get around this by putting it in some kind of soft case lined with neoprene or foam padding and then throw it in a purse. if you wear tight jeans and put it in a pocket it may ghost dial. the space bar does have a bit of a defect. there are two triggers under the space bar so that it will work if pushed on either end, the defect with this is that if you push too close to the center it sets off both triggers causing a double space which on this phone causes a period with a space, supposed to be convenient but is more of a pain actually. to get around this you can train yourself to push on just the end of the space or you can practice pushing it ever so slightly to get just one trigger to click, if you play with it you will notice the second trigger clicking if you press just a bit too hard. I don't have the skill to do this so I just leave a bunch of periods in my texts and look like a retard, oh well. the buttons on this phone are small and close together, but this is my first blackberry type phone. my finger tips are wide so I easily press the wrong button, but with practice I find if I turn my thumb tips vertical its easier. the menus on this phone are inneficient, there is no single press button that takes you to your contacts like there was on my last lg flipfone. most of the ringtones are pretty lame, and most of the alert tones have a huge discrepancy in volume from the ringtones. the wifi works okay, and I can use it to acces my mail through the browser, but I can't get the email sync to work on my phone to auto load my emails. which is funny because it was so easy to do with my ipod touch, maybe the ipod sync is interfering with syncing this phone? yes using the browser eats up minutes and tracfone sets up buttons that make it easy to accidentally do this, but I am used to it from my last lg tracfone which I had for two years and my Samsung net10 phone which I had before that. you just have to be mindful that there are buttons you can't ever touch unless you want to go browsing and use up minutes. you must train your brain and you will be fine. I haven't accidentally browsed in over a year.now for the good qualitiesthe phone is very attractive, it looks like a nice smartphone from the back and sides, the weight and texture of it feels like quality. the battery seems to have a fairly good time between chargings. I go about 6 days with light use. the call quality seems better than with my last phone (an lg fliphone) especially from cell to cell even when I don't have full bars.so in short this phone has many little problems, but on the upside it is cheap, handsome, has wifi, a full keyboard, triple minutes and many other features.UPdate: so I've been using this phone for about two weeks now or so, and I am noticing some major problems.first of all I tried reactivating my old lg phone with a new phone number for my dad to use. but in order to do this I had to call tracfone tech support. they told me the phone needed a new sim card because it had been deactivated, so they sent me a new one in the mail a few days alter for free. then i had to call back tech support to reactivate it with the new sim and this is when all the problems started. after being on the phone with them for over an hour and repeating my personal information several times and having to pay 20 dollar for minutes to reactivate the phone, they ended up switching my old phone number back to my old phone and deactivating my new phone. suffice it to say, this same s*** has been going on for two weeks now with multiple calls and hours to tracfone tech support. and things are still not as they should be yet. I don't know if they are even capable of getting things the way I want, all I know is I was with tracfone for two years and had no problem till tech support. tracfone works flawlessly as long as you just use the automated internet or direct phone options. its a piece of cake to activate a new phone and even port a number from net 10 and to even upgrade your phone all through the automated system, but once you call tracfone tech support you are basically screwed. because they don't seem to have a clue what they're doing, or it seems like their system is super complexed, it seems almost as if they are writing code while trying to fix my account.another thing, the phone seems to shut off while in my pocket, I guess from a button getting pressed or something. and then it won't let me turn it back on for several minutes.update..... so I've been using this phone for almost a month now, and yeah it seems to pretty much suck, the scroll button is a piece of crap, twitchy and jumpy. the phone seems to shut of completely about once a day when I travel around with it in my pocket...I think it has something to do with service dropouts or something and then it won't let me turn it back on for about three minutes. when i'm at work having to kneel doing hotel maintenance the buttons get easily pressed in my pocket and it unlocks itself and starts browsing about once a day.the call quality is still far superior on this phone as with other Samsung phones. talking to a person on an I-phone is no problem, clear and no digital distortion as with my last lg flip phone where I couldn't even understand a person on an I-phone. but because of the other problems with this phone im gonna have to get rid of it, I bought an lg 840g which seems lovely so far but I haven't activated it yet. fingers crossed.also I have figured out the secret to tracfone tech support. the main tech support people have no clue what they are doing and just give you a run around and act like they know what they are talking about and screw up your service and your account and will try to make you feel like you are the idiot and its all your fault. some of the supervisors know a little something and will screw up your phone and service a little less, maybe. the managers are the only ones who may know what they are doing and can get it done in any reasonable amount of time...say maybe a half an hour to an hour. the general technicians will transfer you to a supervisor if you request it. the supervisors will transfer you to a manager if you request it. the manager got the job done for me finally that previously took six calls and four new sim cards sent in the mail without success. the managers will probabally transfer you to another manager if you request it or maybe there is even someone about the managers, I don't know. if they are very busy you will have to wait a long time to get a transfer. they were not busy at 10 am Hawaii time on Wednesday. therefor if you are getting a bunch of b.s. from a tech or super or manager and they are making you feel like you are stupid and they are talking a bunch of jargon that doesn't even apply to you immediately request to be transferred to someone higher up. and don't feel bad about being rude to them, but don't be too rude or they could cut you off. you might just get what you want.","July 27, 2013",
mobile phone,"Solid, ""smart-er"" Tracfone",Coach,R3GLBSQ021VQIA,3,"I was getting a little tired of having such a low-feature phone. While I rarely used it for more than texting or calling my family or very close friends/colleagues, I realized the benefit of having features like 3G access or a full keyboard when I was travelling or at a store wishing I could check reviews on a product.I did my homework, and decided I liked either this phone or the LG 840g for their wi-fi capabilities. I've had the 390g for 2 months now, so I feel like I can share a pretty solid pro-con list for those looking to buy.Pros:- The keyboard is great. Some review complain about issues with pocket dialing, etc. I have had none. I just hold down the ""lock"" key, stick it in my pocket, and go about my day with no worries.- The wifi is pretty easy to use. I'll admit, I haven't used it a lot, but when I have, it's been pretty easy. I don't love the browser, but I know I could download a diff't one if I really want to.- The look/menu is very user-friendly. Easy to make calls, navigate the menu, take pics, and find whatever I need to on the phone.Cons:- The battery. I work in an office with ZERO reception. Even Verizon users have spotty reception. My battery was dying after mild use form me and NO use at work... in about 36 hours! I've started putting in in Airplane mode at work, which does give me a solid 5-ish days of battery... but I shouldn't have to do that, you know?- The sensitivity of the scroll button is a little hard to get used to. It's more of a personal preference issue. I'll adjust my volume then press the scroll button and it's so sensitive that it re-adjusts the volume. Not going to be a big deal to some...Overall, I kind of miss my t301g. I think this phone is really close to being great, it's just not quite what I want it to be.","February 7, 2013",

mobile phone,"Have had it a year, bought another one reluctantly",jmonte,R1JBLD7CFYFAC2,3,"I had been with TracFone for over five years before buying this phone. My first TracFone was a nearly indestructible Motorola V170 flip phone. That phone had free incoming text which was really nice and I had bought a lifetime double minute card for it. I wore out my belt holsters for it, some in as little as a day and eventually started keeping it in my pocket uncased. I started with it in my hip pocket and broke the antenna off (a little nubby antenna) in a couple of days. Replaced the antenna and moved the phone to my front pocket where it lived for many many years only getting slight scratches on the outside from my keys. When it started falling apart, I could only find one like it for over $100 on eBay and I had only spent around $30 new at Wal Mart on it to begin with. The battery didn't quit on me until after five years. (I kept it turned off except when I was using it or expecting a call. Once it started falling apart, it took about a year for the screen quit working, but I could still charge it and make calls with it. Then it started being hard to turn on. So began my search for a new TracFone because I liked the TracFone system and the phone was so well made.I finally picked the S390G because of the free triple minutes for life and the WiFi. I read all the reviews at the time and decided I could probably live with it even if I didn't like it much. After about 11 months the ""mouse button"" or ""trac pad"" quit letting me scroll or move about on the screen with it. It still worked as a button when you pressed it, but wasn't much use if you couldn't scroll to what you needed to press on. Then a couple weeks later it would sometimes charge and sometimes not. I thought maybe it was just the battery wearing out so I bought a new one at Batteries Plus for $40 (twice the price of a new phone with a new battery) and found out it wasn't the battery. I returned the battery.......So began my search for a third TracFone. There was only one other model with WiFi besides the S390G. I decided I didn't want to try the other TracFone with WiFi and I liked the S390G well enough to go ahead and get another one.Now for the pros and cons of the S390G based on owning one for a year and a 2nd one for a week:Pros:WiFi - the WiFi on the first phone would connect to some sources and not connect to others. I have converted several Linksys and Cisco/Linksys wireless routers to repeaters running on dd-wrt firmware, so I know what I am doing in this area. The WiFi would not work with my home router or repeater. All my computers and my Wii system will work on my home router and my repeater. Even my broadband home phone would work over the repeater. The S390G would connect to an out of town library I used to go to a lot every time I tried. All other sources would either not connect at all, or would connect and disconnect right away. So aside from getting a few games while connected at that library, the WiFi was pretty much useless on my first S390G. The new S390G connected to my home system right from the box and I have tried it on one other WiFi source so far and it worked there where my first S390G would not.Voice Recorder - You can voice record on this phone and then save as a voice message, ring tone, or alarm tone.Alarms - You can set multiple alarms on this phone. You can set each one for different days or activate them for one day only. You can set a different sound for each alarm. You can record a message and set it to an alarm to play the message when you want the message as a reminder.Cons:Apps - about 99% of the apps will not run on it. And if your app requires an internet connection, you will be charged for internet usage unless you are connected to a WiFi source. I finally went through all the reviews of this phone looking for app sources. I eventually found out that your apps have to be java apps that are jar/jad compatable AND I only found one web site with free java jar/jad compatable games that were worth keeping on the phone. So far I have been unable to find that site for the new phone and will have to go back through all the reviews so I can find it and get some games for this phone. BTW, when you are using WiFi and you lose the connection, you have about 1 second to get the browser closed or the 3G connection will kick in and you will start being charged minutes.Internet browser hot key - My phone never had a problem pocket dialing 911. However, the power but got pressed in my pocket a lot and the internet browser hot key got pressed a lot too. Most of my minutes were stolen through this flaw on this phone. I could not find a hard case anywhere to use with this phone. I eventually got a nice soft case made by Golla that had a side zipper pouch and a velcro flap that had a padded pouch and a non padded pouch under the flap. The phone fit in the padded pouch very nicely, but would still turn on and off in my pocket and would still connect to the 3G in my pocket because of the browser hot key. There is no way to disable this hot key or to make it open a different browser. I eventually started taking my battery out when not in use and putting the phone in the padded pouch and the battery in the unpadded pouch. Now with the new phone I keep the extra battery charged and in the zipper pouch as an extra in case the other one goes dead about the time I really need to make or receive a call.Small keys - I used to text a lot with my old flip phone. I rarely text any more with this phone. Even after using it a year, it is just plain hard to text on and my fingers are not even all that large.Conclusion:I liked the phone well enough to buy it again, but I doubt many people would be willing to remove the battery when not in use. I did buy a nice gel case with the new phone. It was a gel case made for this model and fits nicely and now I just leave the back battery cover off the phone and the gel case holds the battery in place when I am using the phone. I just take the lower have of the gel case off to remove the battery and then put the gel case back in place to keep dust out. The gel case makes for a slightly tight fit in the soft case, but it works. Be sure to read other reviews of this phone and decide if this is the phone for you.....or not.","October 17, 2013",
mobile phone,Great [when you get a good one],O. Ogden,R2NCPBYM47F6SR,3,"Ok so this is a replacement for my first S390G which after 2 weeks would no longer connect via the browser, but everything else worked. I did every step and then some that Tracfone had me go through [again & again.............]. So if you have ever dealt with what passes for tech support with Tracfone. So my situation is i am my elderly mothers caregiver and i do not have time to jump through Tracfones hoops so i just got another one and it works fine. What i like about this phone is the wi-fi works and it gets decent battery life and it gets better reception than any other phone i have owned and since i live in the middle of nowhere where most phones do not work well if they work at all so if i were rating it on reception alone it would be a 5. So here is the bad first off this phone has an optical puck / button for navigation that can be a little hard to control and the buttons could be better, but i have large hands & fingers. the phone has a weak speaker , but the headphone jack gives clear sound and while the mp3 player works and is far better than some other phones i have had and has a bad quirk in that if you are browsing songs and open a folder or album that has only 1 song if you dont back out quick it automatically plays it which when you are just trying to browse and or build playlists can be quite a pain and if you put it in your pocket before the screen locks the optical puck is going to crank the sound. I have not had any problems with phantom dialing like some people have reported as it has been my experience that when the screen locks it in fact stays locked until you unlock it. Only one otjher thing i dislike about the phone is when it is switched on it has to scan the 32gb sdhc class4 card and until it takes 1-2 min to do that [because i have it 3/4 full] it will do nothing else and as i have not gotten a class10 to use with it yet i do not know how much faster the process can go. For a cheap phone for me at least it has been worth the trouble and until Tracfone offers a better deal or it dies i will stick with it.","September 3, 2013",
mobile phone,Hate the Browser option...,"C. Kelly ""C. Kelly""",R1ERJJO3KL3Y1W,3,"I only purchased this phone because my previous Tracfone phone stopped holding a charge, and it was so old that I couldn't find a battery to fit it. This one was inexpensive and had good reviews.I rarely use my Cell Phone. I usually only purchase a one year card with 400 minutes in order to keep it activated. I only use it for when I'm working on my route. For emergencies, tow, ect. and also so the kids can call me.The phone works just fine. My old phone was a flip open kind...I thought I would like that this one doesn't flip.But I hate it!I usually leave the phone on in my pocket so I can hear it if the kids call.I have found that sometimes when I'm done work and take it out that the browser was opened up while in my pocket. And has been eating up my minutes!!!!!I have resorted to leaving the phone in my cup holder instead of my pocket and still last week I got done work and found the browser open again! I tried to disable the browser option but I can't find away to do it.I might use it for 5 minutes a week....That's on a busy week! Like, I said I rarely use it.I had over 2000 minutes when I got this phone. I have lost over 400 minutes because of the browser getting accidentally opened.If it weren't for this issue I'd give this phone a 5 star rating.If anyone knows how to DISABLE THE BOWSER please contact me by leaving a comment under this review.","May 6, 2013",
mobile phone,Just Okay!,Debra Dailey,R3JRVBD3DSXW5O,3,"I purchased this phone to update my old 31/2 yr old phone that I was using. I have straight talk and after 3+ yrs my phone was just not getting a good signal anymore so I thought I'd give this phone a shot. I have to say I really am not crazy for this phone. I was looking for a simple phone. I'm not really into the high tech phones. I am just wanting a simple phone that makes calls and texts. Using the web on my phone isn't a big deal but being able to from time to time is ok. The more I use this phone there are things I like but some things I hate. One big pet pev is that everytime you get a text is the stupid phone shows you how much its deducting from your minutes. It drives me nuts! I do not want to see every deduction of my minutes everytime I use the phone. There is a feature in it that shows that so I can go there to see it if I choose. I think it should not show that until you get to 100 or less minutes on your phone. There is no way to shut it off from showing it. I have looked and looked. Not crazy about the texting either. When I write a text and go to send I type in the persons name and it will not let me send it that way. I have to go in and find them in contacts to add them and then it will send. It's just kinda dumb that I can't type their name and send. These little things drive me nuts. If I could have tried this first I would have not kept this phone. There are better phones. I guess I will have to learn to like it for now because I am not buying another one. I'll deal with it for another 2 or 3 yrs and I will upgrade again. But other than those things, it's not a bad phone. The sound is good and it does have some nice features. I would really like this phone if I could stop seeing the stupid minute deduction everytime I use it!!!","February 15, 2013",

I would be a great phone.,"November 1, 2013",
mobile phone,G for Gullible,RD,R1L318HEVHZ0NX,3,"I bought this phone in case I wanted to look cool surfing the internet and do it cheaply . As it turns out the only browsing going on is done unwittingly. Nearly every time I pick the phone out of the belt carrier the browser is already on. This is with the keypad lock engaged. If I password lock the phone then it calls 911 by itself. It definitely needs a hard cover over the front. This can be accomplished buying the gel cover/hard shell for the back of the phone and placing the gel cover over the back and the hard shell over the front and then placing in a leather belt carrier. Although I usually miss the incoming calls before I can get to them. If you want to surf the internet , get a smarter phone and pay for a plan. If you just want to text and call this phone is ok but leave it in the car where it might not cause problems and use up minutes by itself. If you want to carry a phone in your pocket, get a flip top or be disappointed. I believe an engineer was tasked to find a design that would use up minutes without the user's fingers being required to push the buttons.","October 18, 2013",
mobile phone,Its does what I want it to do...,"Scrribledletters ""Scrribs""",R3QB9A1IN1WT5C,3,This is a good phone for people who do not want to pay more than $20 for a phone and do not want to have to pay monthly. There are however some problems within the making of the phone... I personally have had no problems with it dialing 911 or unlocking in my pocket or purse but I can see how it would be possible. My biggest gripe is that when you press the space bar while texting it puts a period at the end of the word instead of just a space. This is annoying if you are trying to get out a quick message. To combat accidentally hitting the browser I always make sure it is on its wifi setting. I wish there was an option to disable the browser but I assume it is there way of getting rid of extra mins. The triple mins are wonderful and do make most of the flaws worth it.,"October 12, 2013",
mobile phone,"The phone is great 5 stars, but tracfone changed their policy, 1 star...","Troy D ""Troy D""",RL9X1X1K92N10,3,"I got this to upgrade from my old Tracfone. Every time I have upgraded before I got ALL my minutes transferred, this time they claimed that any bonus minutes are NOT transferable... Since I had bought a Double minutes card, all the minutes I had on the phone were doubled, so they only transferred HALF of my minutes to my new phone, claiming they would transfer only PAID minutes, not the bonus minutes that I had received (over the course of three years). I lost over 1000 minutes. they ALSO could not transfer my old number. After two weeks of going back and forth, almost daily calls to Tracfone, trying to get it done and having no luck, I gave up and had to accept a new number.

mobile phone,Time too move on...,JerryNJ,R2VK92Z422GBT6,3,"I've been using this phone for a year & a half now. My daughter upgraded her S3 to the S4 and I am taking the S3 to use on her account as a second line. Im not a big cellphone user. An occasional call, a few texts a week...that's about it. 10 bucks a month as a second line. Anyway, the S390 has been a good phone for me. No real complaints other then these 2... 1)...the camera stinks. Can't post pictures to FB. I like to do this, sending pics to my son, daughter-in-law and grandkids in South Carolina. 2)...When the phone is in my pocket, it turns off everytime I squat or bend over! AND, more times then not, it connects to the browser by itself, using my minutes! And yes, it even does this when the phone is (supposedly) locked. Other than these 2 problems, the phone is ok. Good reception, good size and held a full charge for 3 days. The best part about the phone is it came with triple minutes. I transferred over 600 minutes from my previous tracfone and got 1500 minutes included with the purchase of the S390 from HSN. For the ENTIRE year & a half of owning it, I NEVER had to purchase any more minutes. I still have 200 minutes left, good until April 2014. For the price, you can't beat the value. One more thing...the phone has never dialed 911 like it has for many other reviewers. If it did, I would have definitely gotten rid of it after the second time. 911 MUST NOT be bothered with this type of nonsense!","September 24, 2013",
mobile phone,Love the triple minutes but hate how easy it is to pocket dial 911,A. Templin,R2A0R9EQHCG3T,3,"This phone was exactly what I was looking for. An inexpensive model with triple minutes that I could easily text on. Using data is super inexpensive. I use it mainly to look up sports scores on ESPN (I disable pictures which means after 15 minutes of browsing scores, I've used only used a minute or at most 2)The down side is how easily it is to pocket dial 911. I've unfortunately done this multiple times to my great embarrassment. I'm not sure what a good workaround for this would be.","August 27, 2013",

mobile phone,The S390G really does not live up to its advertising...,Pete,R255WN5R9P27AV,3,"The most disappointing: Evidently a user is supposed to be able to completely manage this phone by using ""Samsung PC Studio"" (I tried several versions), which includes, backups, contacts, settings and so forth. The truth is, that cannot happen because the phone's operating system will not connect to a PC either by USB or Bluetooth. I am a computer engineer and tried several different things in both Windows XP and Win-7. ""PC Studio"" resolutely refused to acknowledge the phone was connected. But I was able to connect to the 32G micro-SD card via USB as though it was connected to a card reader. That saves having to removed it from the phone and connect directly to a card reader. But without ""PC Studio"", I would have to enter 100 contacts and other data, ONE. LETTER. AT. A. TIME. That isn't going to happen! I was also hoping to add my own alarm tones as opposed to spending minutes to get some from Tracfone. Without PC Studio, that function doesn't work either.The second most disappointing: I was hoping to replace my Apple iPOD functions with the mp3 reader in the phone. But the functions of the phone's mp3 player are so limited and controls so intractable that, after about a week's experimenting, I decided that really was not a good option. iPOD is much better.The third thing disappointing: Right after buying the phone for $30 and spending another $30 for a 32G microSD card which won't get much use (see above), the phone was selling for $21. Bad timing I guess.On the positive side: The 390 does have triple minutes, the alarms are handy and work well, the calendar is pretty good, and the calculator is minimal but okay. And it's nice to be able to connect to GSM 2g & 3g.Conclusion: I bought this particular phone mainly because my view of Samsung quality in products was A++. Now I have revised that to maybe B+. I'm puzzled that anyone would rate this little toy 5-stars. I must be missing something. C'est la vie.Pekelo-Pete","July 2, 2013",

mobile phone,A missing feature,buffy,R3EZXS88ZEEGW3,3,"Overall, I like this phone although the first one I purchased did have a problem in that the battery charge would only last about 1 day even when the phone was not in use. Tried a new battery but that did not correct the issue.One big issue with this phone is that it seems near impossible to transfer the contacts from it to any other phone, or vise versa. I spent days trying to figure out how to accomplish this, but was unsuccessful. The directions in the user manual were not much help. Searching the internet for some help lead me to many forums where other users were having the same issues. So I've had to enter my contact list manually which used up a full charge on the battery because it took so long. So I wouldn't recommend this phone for anyone who has a long contact list.","June 24, 2013",
mobile phone,You get what you pay for,overthar,R3I6Q5NV7O4KIH,3,"The phone is functional but quirky. It's not intuitive and one needs to read the instructions before trying to figure out how to use it. The triple minutes is the best deal from this phone. One feature fault of the phone is that it shows you that a text message has arrived, but it doesn't let you know what the text is about or whom it's from unless you go ""Back"" and select ""Menu"" then ""Messages"" then go to the ""Inbox"". From the inbox you can then see who the message is from and delete it without opening it or being charged. If you open it upon arrival you will automatically be charged half a minute.

It is a little tiny button that scrolls when you move your finger across it. While ""convenient"" it is a real hassle. The D pad is much better. Also, I am having to find another phone because it does NOT pick up where I live. While the other Tracfone does, I have to leave my house, stand in the yard and wish for a signal.

mobile phone,It's okay,Betty~Boop,R2NLM4G532UJNZ,3,"I chose this rating because for a novice, this phone takes patience to set up and get running the way you like it.After using up lots of minutes with tracfone techs, I finally got my phone set up.The phone works fine, the navigation key is EXTREMELY sensitive and takes some getting used to. Setting up the wifi took patience and more knowledge than the website shares. Thank goodness for the phone reviews and blogs or I would never have figured it out.The phone ""butt dials"" often and I feel is problematic and a nuisance. One reviewer mentioned getting around that problem by dialing in some nonsensical numerals so that if it does unlock itself and dial it will not dial a contact number. That's fine if you remember but how annoying is that to have to dial a few nonsensical numbers after each time you use the phone?Would I buy this phone again? No. Mainly because of the overly sensitive navigation key and the problem with accidental unlocking and dialing issue.All in all, the phone is decent. If you are used to these types of problems.One more thing, when the phone is not on speaker phone mode the sound of the voice on the other end has an annoying rattle sound which means the sound on this particular phone is messed up. At this point, I do not want to complain and get a replacement. I would have to go through all the annoying set up again and so I just use the phone on speaker phone whenever I can.Disappointed at best. Would not recommend this phone to a novice.","January 10, 2013",
mobile phone,It works and it's cheap,roscoe,R1BBSL9HDF3LTS,3,"The device went bad after 5 weeks. Tracfone ""charged"" 300 minutes in order to change over to the new replacement. No way to track minutes on Tracfone's site.Device communicates with my PC through ""PC Studio"", Samsung actually calls the program ""NPS"" for ""New PC Studio"" version 1.5.1.11053_3. About half of the features on NPS work. Web Posting to Facebook does not work and PC occasionally kicks off NPS (the program is unstable) and you have to start all over. For my telephone book, it offers enough contact fields enter a name, category, 3 numbers and a e-mail address, that's all, and does not match out all the fields available within the S390G. The images stored on the internal memory may or may not exist, depending on which routine you are running. Looks like you still have to go to the phone to attach face images to each phone number.I bought a cover for it for $3.58 delivered and also keep it in a recycled belt-loop holster. But it still dialed 000 Emergency when I was reaching sideways to crank up the window on the other side of the car. Apparently I was half-ways sitting on it with my hip and each oscillation from turning the crank pressed the buttons again and again. So I scrounged around the trash and found an empty, rigid plastic antacid bottle, cut the top off and the device just barely fits into it and put that into my holster. That might keep the buttons from being pushed inadvertently. So far that has worked.The camera isn't bad for a point and shoot and the adjustments are functional. But it cannot take a picture of a business card, driver license, bar code, etc. Which came in handy with my previous smartphone when I was in a multi-car accident. The camera does engage almost instantly by holding down the zero key and has come in very useful when you have to be quick about it and you're nervous to boot. The video appears adequate, has good sound. Used it twice so far.The downloadable Opera browser is very powerful once you spend time setting it up, and shows off the strengths (and weaknesses) of the device. You can't cut and paste urls because the device isn't multitaskable but Opera helps out a little bit there for you. Facebook has its own app designed for this type of device and works well. The device has trouble attaching photos, have to keep trying and it eventually works. Cannot preview thumbnails before selecting them, have to memorize the file name first. All this should be done with a WiFi connection to save air-time costs. WiFi will sometimes become disabled and I have to reset the device for WiFi to work again.I cannot comment on the messaging, e-mail or music features because I am not using them for now. For my purposes it is really a phone with a camera and a few toys, which is fine because that pretty much covers what I had been using my previous smart phone for anyway. Decent price for what actually works - which is not much more than their $15 camera- flip phones. The best part is the triple minutes, keeping my air-time costs down to about $10/month with a 1-year minutes purchase.","June 7, 2013",

mobile phone,Atleast it has a camera,Brady,RE5AB177X3LK5,3,"If you want all the bells and whistles, get an Iphone or Android. If you want a phone that has a QWERTY keyboard, camera, bluetooth, and music player - this would be a decent phone to do the job.I got this to replace a cheaper contract phone through Tracphone. It has wifi, but it is extremely limited to what you can do with it. I believe it is pretty much useless. The phone's browser does not support Java or Flash, making almost every modern website difficult or impossible to bring up. Don't count on listening or watching music or videos online.The only thing I like is the camera and the music player, and Bluetooth. Other than that, it is a blackberry-like phone.

mobile phone,"Ok, for the price.",Donald,R3QPG4OROVFTWY,3,"This phone has some great features. I really like that is has Wi-Fi capability, and triple minutes. Now if I could only get a signal at home. It must only be on some of them, because I notice others not mentioning it at all, but there are a couple. And it is not my location or the Tracfone signal, as Samsung tried to tell me. I have two old LG Tracfones here that when turned on get full bars or just under that. This one i usually score one bar, and when on a call it cuts in and out, or I cannot hear the other person at all. Once in a while it will jump to two or three bars, never more than that. Even when I am outside in different locations, maybe three. I think if I were standing next to the tower I might get five. As for the screen unlocking and accidental dialing, I have never had that problem. Although I think I might take that over no signal.

mobile phone,It's an ok phone,Gail Dennis,R1BQZ0YT4DEF7W,3,"I purchased this product 8 month ago and overall it's an OK phone. Since I've had this phone I've ran into several problems using it...for example the center key (back in January I purchased the Samsung S125G and one of the things that I liked about that phone was the fact that the center key was surrounded by a border which made scrolling up, down, left and right easy) unfortunately does not have this feature hence when you scroll either up, down, left or right you have to take you time so as to not hit the wrong icon. In addition when it comes to sending photos/videos to your Facebook/Twitter account you have to send the photos/videos to your email address first then you can save them as a jps file which you can them download to your Facebook/Twitter account.

mobile phone,QWERTY phone with a very bad QWERTY keyboard.,Neil Allan,R1LS12VI8HMTGD,3,"Decent as a phone but the keyboard is pretty much the worst qwerty pad i've ever used. The buttons are smaller than I was expecting, smaller than they were on my LG ENV3, so this takes getting used to... BUT, now that I'm getting good at it I've noticed a glaring design flaw - If you type rapidly enough, any successive keystroke will simply repeat the last input. For example, if you want to type ""Ok,"" you obviously type O, but if you follow with K quickly enough, it simply types ""Oo."" This basically forces you to type slowly. I really don't know what they were thinking.Also you have to read a message and burn 0.3 minutes just to see who it's from. This is my first tracfone so I'm not sure if this is a tracfone thing or if it's how this handset behaves but there are many instances where a message can easily be ignored if you know who's sending it, but with this device you have to burn your time if you want to know any details whatsoever about any message you receive. which i suppose is fair, but still annoying.","April 3, 2013",

mobile phone,Not what I was expecting,Nonna162,RYS9FL9VLNEHT,3,"There is a lot to like about this phone i.e. it looks good and it feels good when holding it. The camera, MP3 player, Wi-Fi cability, etc. are others. I bought this phone as an upgrade to my small tracfone slider. The information on everything I read says that the battery talk time is up to 6 hours and standby time up to 12.5 days. In the initial set up I followed the instructions and all whet well, but and that is a big BUT the battery life is nowhere near what it says it should be. I am not a heavy cellphone user and do not surf the net. I bought this phone as my back up emergency phone.....which would indicate that it is not the phone I do most of my calling and texting from anyway. So far and with very, very minimal use I have had to charge it everyday. My main cell phone....the one I use for business, etc. I charge every couple of days and even on days where there is a great deal of use I never go to less than 2 or 3 battery bars left. Not with this phone. I don't know whether I got a bad phone or what, but I know this is probably not going to work for me very long before I need to look for something different. Again, it is a nice looking phone and the triple minutes was a plus. And, Amazon does not disappoint on the delivery. It arrived on time...I do love that about Amazon.","March 14, 2013",
mobile phone,A Tad Disappointed,E. Howarth,R2ADO8M3OLMCJ,3,"Was hoping this would solve the problems I've had with the LG800. While it does receive much better in the presence of a wireless router and a computer monitor, it kept using minutes trying to connect with my email, so I had to erase that. Now I am afraid to try any online features. The automatic lock feature does not apply to trying to get online, apparently, and if there is no way to lock that, you can't protect your minutes. The keyboard is more complicated to use than I was expecting. I should have spent a little more money and gotten a phone with the sliding keyboard and better online savvy.","March 8, 2013",

mobile phone,Good Phone with Reservations,R. Arnold,R3TRJI1XQYEM6A,3,"This is an excellent phone if you're going to carry it in a pouch or probably even a purse. Sadly, I don't like pouches on my belt and I don't carry a purse. The phone has a nasty habit of dialing 911 or 000 while carried in the pocket. It's well documented across the web and numerous people have complained about it to Tracfone. I guess it's a safety feature, but you can't disable the emergency buttons even while the keyboard is locked. I have also had it hit the right combination to unlock the keyboard while in my pocket, then activate the web browser. I lost a quick hour of airtime that time.The phone does have wifi capability and you would be wise to use it when you can. Tracfone doesn't really document it, but this phone will bill about triple when using the cell signal or sending MMS messages. I guess that's the penalty you pay for having a 3G capable phone. The phone is Java based so there are apps that will work with it, but you have to do a lot of trial and error testing to see if the app will work. I've found that some do and some don't, mainly because there are hardly any signed apps for this phone. I still fat finger the buttons when texting but I do manage to get out a short text in less than an hour (just kidding), I'm just not a fast texter.All in all, it's a decent phone, for basic web browsing and texting. Just remember, it is a triple minutes for life phone and you'll need those triple minutes if you plan on doing a lot of web surfing and MMS texting.","December 17, 2012",

mobile phone,Wifi on This Phone is Defective,tc,R3QKQHQBJMXD6C,3,"I purchased this particular phone for the wifi capability. I have spent numerous hours personally trying to troubleshoot the issue.

When I try to connect to my home network, it just says ""Authentication Failed"" and ""Disconnected."" So, I'm returning this phone and trying another. I'll come back and lower my stars even further if the next one does the same thing.I like the ability to have an SD card. My last Tracphone didn't have that.The camera is not so great, you can't zoom in, there's no flash, and pics are low quality.The track button in the center was tricky to get used to because it's so sensitive.Everything else works fine and it has more capabilities than my other Tracphone.It's a good price for the phone, will be even better with one that can connect to wifi.p.s.

I dont care to chat on the phone much so now my wife and I text each other instead which is only 0.3 minutes each time. The main problem bugging me is, as others have said, that even though I ""lock"" the keyboard, the phone has dialed 911 at least 4 times now now while in my pocket. Twice, the police have called me back asking if Im OK, though I did not know that my phone had called an emergency.

mobile phone,Its an okay phone for those that wont use it hardly,maskedgamer,R2V9HEHMV6HK3F,3,"For 20bucks and the 15bucks a month a pay for minutes on this phone it's good enough for me. I only use it when I need it to make a quick call or just to carry with me when I'm driving. I'm not a cell phone person but when I was I can immediately see everything about this phone to hate. They keyboard is annoying because the most important part THE NUMBERS YOU DIAL! are so tiny and hard to press. Also let me not forget to add try calling when the number is Phrase or business name like 1800flowers or 1800Pickups because you cannot! There are no letters on the number dials like a standard phone. The most annoying feature however is the slide button in the center. It's extremely touch sensitive and navigating with it is painfully annoying. It's almost like playing ring toss at a carnival trying to get the rings centered on your target while it goes everywhere else but there. The phone also seems to enjoy costing you money/minutes by going into the browser at the slightest touch... oh I'm sorry they installed a GIANT button next to the slider that enters you in browser mode anytime you ""oversteer"" accidentally with the annoying slider button. How many times do you think an adult human finger is going to slide off the tiny center button and tap the large button next to it? MANY TIMES! and Net10 knows this and so does Samsung. It will readily enter browse mode at the slightest of touches and it's annoying. 9/10 times I use this phone the browser goes off. Another problem with the phone aside from that issue is its lack of durability. I brought a case for the phone but none of the cases seem to come with a complete face cover to kept the buttons form being pressed. These new phones may have superior tech but they are inferior when it comes to durability and practicality to a flip phone in every way. This phone is too big and too flat to fit in my pocket and it just leaves your phone open to getting lint and debris on the phone and buttons not to mention being scrunched and pressed while you're carrying it around. As a man I carry my Keys and my wallet with me when I leave the house. Tell me... if you've ever seen a mans key set or the bulky wallets we carry around there's no room for this over sized flat phone to fit in our pockets comfortably. It's like carrying around a Cable TV remote in your pocket.I for the most part gave up on the idea of carrying the phone on me I usually leave it in my car when I'm out. Which is fine because I hardly find myself needing to call someone at the spur of the moment but if I do I know a quick walk to my car and there I go. I still have my old flippy phone from Net10 that I also rarely used and will probably seek to have that reactivate with a new Simm card if this phone ticks me off enough. I like my flip phone. It was sleek enough to drop in my pocket and never got in the way of anything. Plus, it did it's job of taking and sending calls quite well. Half the features on this phone I don't need and won't use but for 20 bucks it's whatever. It's more modern looking compared to the usual ""This is a cheap prepaid phone"" look that these phones usually carry. It looks up to date and it has a camera on it that has video capture and takes photos...too bad it's the worst camera quality and video quality you have ever seen in your life. My old LG flip phone I had 8 years ago from Verizon took better pictures and videos than this thing and I WISH! and I do mean I WISH! I was kidding about that but I am not at all!. This thing doesn't even have a flash on it while my old LG flip phone did. If I could someone how resurrect that phone from the dead and all 2 Pieces it ended up in I would keep that phone for like I loved that phone.The Samsung S390G for me is just a temp phone until I feel the need to use the phone more frequently then I will purchase a better phone and leave Net10 while I'm at it. Net10 is okay if you DON'T use your phone for much other than ""Hi, Hello, How are you"" 5 minute conversations or ""I'm just calling your store to see if you have this item in stock"" type of phone calls. This is NOT! and do mean NOT! in all capital letters with the exclamation mark at the end, type of phone for conversations with the NET10 service. Your minutes will be gone faster than McDonalds #1 SuperSized Combo down a fat man's throat. Anything and everything you do to this phone costs minutes and none of them are created equal. Sending a picture 1-2minutes, receiving a picture 2-4 minutes. Browser .50 minutes every time you hit the button. Text .50 minutes everytime you hit send not to mention .50 every time you receive a text from someone else. That includes the many random Text you'll get from strangers that used to be friends of the previous owner for the phone number Net10 provided you on top of the scam text and calls.These phones are kind of like Hour glasses. From the moment you get them or charge them up with minutes the time/grains of sand just begin to tumble downwards and there's nothing you can do about it but watch them leave the reservoir then once they're all gone you flip the hour glass over or in this case recharge your minutes and it's back to the same game again. Prepaid phones in general are just made to keep you coming back and purchasing more time and losing that time and purchasing more time again just to keep the phone active. It used to be smarter to just get a regular phone plan but with prices so high as they are now for phone plans prepaid is almost economical depending on how you use it. Those Smart phones don't seem so smart when you're spending over 1,500 a year just to have one.","October 14, 2013",

Still happens though, very strange. Anyhow for the tripple minutes it's perfect for prepaid.I should also add that if you download any games, there's a 50/50 chance they won't install right. I've hadn problems with it on several applications too. Facebook apps won't work. I have to use the web browser instead. I've also purchesed a game from the shop available for this phone. One worked, the second didn't. And I used up my attempts to download while trying to get it on. It tries to install but fails at 70%. but that's your typical prepaid service.Wifi works fine, I know others had issues with it but didn't have a problem here.

The keypad is too damn sensitive! Even when locked out, the keypad will come unlocked & dial the ""sos"" code '112' which in turn will call the local 911 dispatch. And since it will do this in the holster or pocket that you have it stored in, you will be totally unaware of this until they will call you back ""what is your emergency?"".There is no way to disable this ""feature"".Also the little nubby-pad used to navigate will change selections at the pressure of a mouse fart at twenty paces. Trying to get through menus, or viewing texts is an extreme hassle to do without it flipping around all over. [read: you get a text and try to scroll down to continue reading, and all of a sudden you are in an entirely different message OR menu] Or while replying, it will select a different message[and addressee], and you will not know until AFTER you hit send.And the space bar will take over a week before it will stop double spacing [and giving you a '.

mobile phone,"It's a smartphone, and you can use it in the rain","J. Rome ""J. Romulous of Algernon""",R3H4KT6KE4C7T5,3,"This phone is merely okay.The camera isn't particularly great. The battery life leaves a lot to be desired. A 45 minute phone call will really put the hurt on your battery, not to mention leaving your wi-fi and mobile data connections on. Even with the Eco setting on full all the time, with regular use you can only expect maybe 5 or 6 hours of use before you have to put it on the charger. On the bright side, it does seem to charge quickly if you're using the wall-charger. This phone is fine if you've got a way to charge it in the car and when you're at home. I would be wary though if you're someone who tends to forget your charger a lot. Boost Mobile? I got to give it a ""meh"" for the Albuquerque area at least. The Sprint network has zero 4G support in ABQ which really bites when you're trying to jam out to Pandora while you're driving and it constantly skips or cuts out. At the end of the day I do still dig this phone because it's my first smart phone and I like being able to use social media apps and radio apps on the go. I'm not a poweruser or anything. But I suppose if you *are* a poweruser you probably aren't scoping out $60 smartphones anyway! Get the Hydro if you're just stoked on the idea of being able to have a smartphone and all that comes with that for the very first time.

The screen is small the the resolution isn't good at all. I bought it to stream music to my car stereo. See below for detailed info:1. It is a much better phone than the Kyocera Rise. It is more responsive to the finger movement. No much lag. Obviously, you cannot compare this to more expensive smart phones at his price range.2. The viewing angle, color accuracy and resolution are subpar.3. The speaker quality is terrible. Not clear at all.4. For whatever reason, there are two little plastic things sticking out by the camera on the backcover.5. The feel of this thing in my hand is awful. The bottom part of the phone has rough edges.6. The camera takes awful pictures.7. Bluetooth connection is excellent.8. The battery drains fairly fast. Like most Android phones, it probably will need to be charged once a day or more.Yes, this phone isn't good at all but at $9.99, it is a cheap MP3 player and it is water proof.

The power button has broken a couple times on me. It seems like the button is just popping out of position or something. Both these times I hit the phone against my hand a few times, and it started to work again.

After I was sure that it wouldn't be needing a rice bath, I was pretty pleased.Durable:While hanging Christmas lights on the roof, it slipped out of my pocket, and fell about 12 feet, landing on my deck. I turned it back on. The back (which it slid down the roof on) was a little scratched up. The screen didn't shatter or break. Two months (MONTHS) later, a possibly unrelated failure of the power button to push in led me to get an insurance replacement. I'm not saying that your phone will survive a fall off of the roof, but mine did. I doubt an iphone would have.Low power/performance:I find that it doesn't have the RAM to handle things like checking email while you're getting directions. Recent updates to the phone and google/Android stuff have left my phone in a continual state of program crashing. I'm hoping to do a factory reset in a few days, after I back up all my data. You'd be an idiot to think that you could enjoy a movie on this. It's too small, but I think that of most phones.

Where I would have had 4 bars with that phone, I only have 1 or 2 in the same areas. I'm pretty sure they didn't tear down a cell tower, so it's gotta be the phone.All in all it was pretty decent for my first taste of Android, and getting to use Ice Cream Sandwich was pretty cool, but that version of the OS might be a little too advanced for this phone.

mobile phone,video recording and slow motion playback too Blurry,Coach George,R3Q53RSL4PXSXE,3,"Main reason I got this phone was cost balanced with IceCream OS (Android 4.0)and rear camera. Needed IceCream because the only few available APP's for video record/slow motion playback/analysis are Android 2.34 or higher. Also the APP's are migrating quickly to 4.0 requirment. Many economical phones and tablets are only 2.30 and lower.Unfortunately the camera; though no more or less megapixel than older Ipad tablets, seems not up to the capability of the sole reason I got the phone. As mentioned got the phone to use programs such as ISwing, V1Golf, and similar to do quick on the fly video record, slow motion playback and analysis of my athletes (Gymnast) to give them nearly automatic visual feedback.This phone; and no others I know of, have slow motion video replay on board. Only via APPs. Thus only choice is to use available APPs. Apparently though the video recording software built into the above programs? and/or limits of the phones camera; results in footage that is too blurred when shooting moving gymnast, head of golf club, Tennis player etc.Have used an older IPad with ISwing and the recording's playback in slowmotion was NOT blurred much. Again IPad has same megapixel camera specs as this phone and same Sport video Analysis products area vailable in both Android and Apple.Needed a new phone anyway, so will keep it but am very dissapointed not being able to use it for intended purpose.","September 24, 2012",

mobile phone,Helpful Tips for this phone!,Victoria MacKenzie-Richert,R24XVDL4RNKEA4,3,"There are some issues that many of you are having with your phones. I figured out ways to cirumvent most of these problems.1. Poor battery life: When the phone first gets activated/boots up, a diolouge pops up, informing you about the Connections Optimizer Service. You really have no option but to accept it. However, What you need to do after you accept it is: 1) Click on the far right button on the navigation panel. 2) Hit ""Settings"". 3) Under Wireless and Networks, hit ""More"". 4) Click ""Mobile Networks"". 5) Click ""Connections Optimizer"". 6) Uncheck the box.2) Issues with the actual battery: It doesn't seem that Kyocera ships with the faulty battery stickers anymore. I thoroughly checked my battery, and the only thing was the ""PULL"" tab on the battery itself. This is also handy for pulling the battery out after random shutdowns.3) Overloaded RAM. It seems that many random shutdowns are caused by overloaded RAM or processor chips. All you have to do to solve this is click on the icon with the two boxes, and swipe away any apps you're not using, or need. This will clear out some RAM. (For instance, on my phone, Maps always starts when I boot the device. I dunno why...)4) A few other reviews have said that the keyboard is a bit hard to operate. After using different methods, I've discovered that it's best to use the physical keyboard as if you were using an on-screen one, that is, with the pads of your thumbs instead of your thumbnails. Old popular slider phones like, say, the LG Rumour, or (from personal experience) the TracFone LG T-401-G, required use of your fingernails to operate the tiny keys. The keys on this phone, however, are larger, and therefore do better with a more flat, even-pressured approach.Generally, my tip would be ""Be patient with this phone. It's a sort of low-end phone, which means that the Nexus, and even some of the other Virgin phones can leave this one in the dust"".There are also some apps I'd like to suggest:1) Start using custom launchers. I'm using Atom, but you could also use Nova, Apex, Go, ADW, or Zeam launcher. Some launchers have special add-on apps that let you control your phone. Go Launcher is the biggest example of this, with roughly 10 add-on apps to choose from.2) An app I've found useful is Onavo. It helps squeeze more data out of your connection so your 2.5GB 3G speeds last longer through the month! In two days it has saved 3 MB. Also, using WiFi will help for when you're at home.3) Custom Browser App. There are dozens to choose from. Dolphin, Maxthon, Chrome, Firefox, Opera ect. Choose one that will make you happy. Unless you use IE, there is a corresponding Android app for your browser, which usually means you can sync your settings, bookmarks, and other goodies between your computer and cellphone. Also, it may result in faster browser speeds.In conclusion, I encourage you to buy this phone and really play around with it. I have not rooted it yet, and likely won't, but I seem to be getting along with it just fine. Android is great because if you break it, you can Factory Reset it. Assuming you didn't do anything drastic to it (which if you didn't root it, would be highly unlikely) you should be fine.Embrace Android. Embrace Freedom.","February 22, 2013",
mobile phone,Kyocera Rise: Promising Phone Suffers High Rate of Bugs & Defects,NewsView,RAIXJKV07RMNR,3,"Seemingly, Amazon has caught on to ubiquity of failures of this product, the Kyocera Rise. Amazon has suspended sales as of this date, stating:ITEM UNDER REVIEW""While this item is available from other marketplace sellers on this page, it is not currently offered by Amazon.com because customers have told us there may be something wrong with our inventory of the item, the way we are shipping it, or the way it's described here. (Thanks for the tip!)We're working to fix the problem as quickly as possible.""Well, Amazon, let me make it simple for you (and those of you reading today): This phone is very promising ---- and also particularly fault-prone. Specifically, it is prone to power-on failures, freezes, app crashing and random reboots.Don't like the sound of that? Neither did I. Except it took owning the phone more than four weeks -- the duration of a typical return period -- to appreciate its utter lack of reliability.Thinking it a smart move, I spent the first 2.5 weeks running the phone, unactivated, over WI-FI, after which I opted to activate it because I had experienced no problem thus far. Shortly after activiation, however, all sorts of ""issues"" began to surface. Yet after attempting just ONE exchange within the 30-day return period -- for what turned out to be an equally buggy replacement -- the retailer refused to help. (Not to smear any of the sellers here, mind you. If you must know, Radio Shack.)The GOOD about this phone:Runs Ice Cream Sandwich, which is newer than the Gingerbread OS I was on with my previous VM phone, an LG Optimus Slider.Noticeably faster than the 800mhz processor in the LG Optimus Slider.Slide-out keyboard. I type with two hands and can do so much faster on this and similar keyboard-equipped phones than I can peck away on-screen. (Sorry, Swype!)Greater internal memory. With the Optimus Slider, which is otherwise a very solid and reliable phone, I was constantly hampered by a scant 181MB of internal memory. And because not every app can be offloaded to a microSD card, the internal memory ""bottleneck"" meant that I was constantly forced to delete or rotate apps. Not so, the Kyocera Rise.Solid voice recognition and Blue Tooth capacity. The purchase of this Kyocera Rise was actually spurred on by the fact that I could get no other VM handset I tried, whether HTC or LG, to run with my Kenwood Bluetooth car stereo, which I received as a holiday gift. A chief aim was to be street legal (hands free) on my cell phone while driving, and this Kycocera Rise was the only compatible phone I found in terms of working reliably with my Kenwood.Good volume range. This phone outputs a louder volume than the LG Optimus Slider. (You may wish to download something like Android Tools to obtain additional volume controls.)Auto-adjusting Screen Brightness. The LG phone I came from didn't offer this feature.After some initial trouble, established reliable WI-FI connectivity, with a fast and responsive feel. (Performance over the SPRINT data network, like most phones, is dependent on local coverage. In my case, performance of the Kyocera Rise is comparable to the LG Optimus Slider.)Battery Life: Using the app ""Juice Defender Plus"", I find it necessary to run the battery saver mode on ""Aggressive"" vs. the ""Balanced"" setting that yielded similar battery life using the LG Optimus Slider. All in all, I cannot complain about battery life -- it seems fairly average to me. (I do suggest turning off GPS, Bluetooth and other apps when not in use. The exception, however, is in being unable to force off the ""Connections Optimizer"" because it constantly re-enables itself on my non-rooted phone.)The BAD about this phone:Backside Camera with Flash. While I wasn't buying this phone for the camera, it isn't great even by 3.2MP standards. The problem is a lack of auto focus (the LG Optimus Slider offers auto focus, and thus takes better pictures with the same number of MPs). The worst thing, however, is that the lack of auto focus means that you can't use bar code scanning apps to do price comparisons in stores, to run cooking/grocery apps, etc.Audio. Call quality is not as natural as the LG Optimus Slider. Callers sound a bit distorted at higher volumes. It's not terrible but it is somewhat tinny.Screen. The display is not spectacular, probably among the weaker I've seen on any smartphone. Still, my ""first impression"" improved considerably once I removed the screen protector. (By contrast, on the LG I left the plastic overlay that shipped with the phone on to serve as a screen guard for several months. You can't get away with that on the Kyocera Rise because the overlay is gray and makes the screen look like blurry newsprint.) In terms of specs, the LG Optimus Slider has what would appear to be identical resolution, yet even when powered off one will notice on the LG and other brands a visibly blacker screen, which lends itself to crisper text and better saturation and contrast while in use.Keyboard. The Kyocera Rise's keyboard, while better than no keyboard at all, has a strange feel to it -- as if to suggest that one must toggle the key to the right or left as opposed to hitting it straight on. After using the LG Optimus Slider, featuring a compact slide-out keyboard with solid tactile ""feedback"", I get the sense on the Kyocera Rise that I am making far more mistakes in my typing than I actually am. The worst offender, by far, is the space bar. I have a sense that the spaces between words aren't there, even if it did, in fact, ""take"". Some of this, in any event, is to be expected when going from one phone to another -- each keyboard has its own feel and to some extent it is a matter of simply adjusting to something new. Still, I'm typing considerably slower on this keyboard than I was on the previous one. On the whole, though, it still beats going at it ""one fingered"" on a virtual keyboard.Power Button. While the on/off switch has yet to pose a problem for me, it is positioned such that it might be easier than some would like to shut off the screen (or the entire phone) by accident while texting using the slide-out keyboard. (Incidentally, for first-time Android owners who are having trouble with the screen dimming and locking too quickly, there is a setting you can adjust to keep the screen powered on longer -- that's one problem that does have an easy fix.)So what's the beef, the reason Amazon has suspended the sale of the Kyocera Rise at this time? If I had to venture a guess, it would be this:What is at first so utterly refreshing about the Kyocera Rise is its lack of bloatware -- not even Facebook comes pre-installed! What is bad is that immediately after activation VM pushes down an ID pack that will, at first blush, over-write anything one loaded previously (potentially a problem if, like me, you configure your phone mostly on WI-FI prior to activation). In the ID app, it is possible to switch back to the previous configuration (stock profile) but the sad fact of the matter is, the VM ID pack, including apps and wallpapers, is still lodged in there taking up memory -- where it perpetually runs in the background. (Of course, it won't show you that any of those other apps are installed until you back out of one profile to load the other.) Perhaps this wouldn't be so bad except for the fact that the phone occasionally ""forgets"" my ID preferences, inexplicably loading the VM profile such that it looks as if my phone has ""lost"" my apps/settings. Worse still, once the VM bloatware installed -- although it may be coincidental, not causal -- the many operational glitches with this phone appeared in tandem. These bugs, which I alluded to earlier, could just as easily imply a high rate of out-and-out defect: daily freezes and reboots, seemingly at random, sometimes to the point of being difficult to power the phone back on! And therein lies the worst possible conclusion one can have about any phone:YOU CANNOT DEPEND ON THIS PHONE IN AN EMERGENCY.The Bottom LineVirgin Mobile, Sprint, Radio Shack and others who sell this model need to follow Amazon's lead: They would do well, for the sake of customer relations, to back the full duration of the manufacturer's warranty because problems apparently occur with this model at a higher-than-average rates. (And no, I would not agree that this is a case of ""getting what you pay for"" -- if only because no brand on the market wishes to commit corporate suicide by issuing overwhelmingly faulty products, which consumers come to distrust.)For all its flaws, I am still inclined to like the Kyocera Rise. It is refreshing, after all, to (still) enjoy a physical keyboard; it is compatible with my Kenwood BT car stereo; and it has far fewer limits on the number of apps I can install than the LG Optimus Slider. Because of the problems described here and elsewhere on the web, however, Kyocera and its retailers need to prepare to stand behind the Rise because there are a lot of faulty ones in circulation, many more than the positive reviews initially imply.It seems, in closing, that the number of glowing vs. negative reviews can be attributed to what one might call ""new toy syndrome"". It's all too tempting to make haste to post reviews on a new and novel item before one has owned said product long enough to vouch for its reliability. I suspect reports of problems with the Kyocera Rise would be that much greater if new owners waited as little as two weeks longer before leaving write-ups on Amazon and elsewhere. After all, only a tiny minority of reviewers bother to post updates if and when product flaws surface. In this instance, the opposite applies, too: I'll be back to update this review if and when there is a SOLUTION to the reliability problems the Kyocera Rise exhibits.I'm crossing my fingers in the hope that a software or firmware update will do the trick.###March 2013 update: Kyocera recently updated the firmware. I have experienced only one random reboot since updating the firmware. The good news, is it seems the phone is more stable now. Only time will tell how it holds up but it's a promising sign that Kyocera is staying on top of the ""issues"".","January 27, 2013",
mobile phone,"Love the phone, but..... see update below","Dana C. Spencer ""newscarver""",R2M8PFISCT8GMX,3,"I purchased this phone for my wife for Christmas to take advantage of the $50 price. I thought it was unlikely I would find a comparable phone as inexpensive and as good as this one anytime soon. I believe I was right. I really wanted to get it for myself also, but I did not have the budget for it. Fortunately for me, my daughter did and surprised me with the same model phone I surprised my wife with. Anyway, my phone replaces an LG Optimus V, which is a decent phone but antiquated by Android standards; it is under powered, slow and I was always bumping into the limit for installing apps to the phone memory. The Rise does not have these problems. It is very fast, and has room for all of the apps I installed on it. In fact, I was moving apps to the SD card and ran out of space on the SD card before internal memory. I got a bigger SD card, so I am going to start moving some of those apps back to the card.There are two problems that bother me with my phone (my daughter purchased it at Best Buy, not Amazon). 1. It occasionally freezes when accessing wi-fi. At least that seems to be the common reason. It may be I overloaded it with apps, so I will see what happens after I move some of them to the card. 2. As has been mentioned by others, the camera stinks. Its not just that the quality is bad, it just does not focus, so I cannot use it to scan bar codes. I would not normally use it as a camera anyway, but I do like to scan products when I see something I like and I want to wish list it or look for a better price. So with this phone I have to manually enter the product ID.I could live without the keyboard feature; Swype actually works quite well with this version of Android, and for me is faster than the keyboard. I have used it for reading Kindle books though, as the horizontal orientation is closer to a tablet view and I can use the arrows to navigate.Sorry folks, this is the kind of review I hate to read; too wordy and not to the point. The bottom line is I like 99% of the phone and would give it 5 stars if not for the crappy camera and I may even forgive it the freezing. I may have a lemon, because my wife's doesn't freeze. But about all she has installed is Facebook and Skype. Oh, I forgot to mention battery life. Yes it is not great, but from what I have seen so far, no worse than the Optimus V. And I use Juice Defender, which helps alot.For $50, which is what we paid for these phones before Christmas, this is a great phone. In fact even if the price goes back up to $100 I'd still say it is worth it, but I would be trying to find it at a lower price. Actually I am going to look for another phone with a better camera in the $100 range. I'll find one.Update to this review:I did ditch the Rise when my daughter got me an iPhone as part of a Sprint family plan. I am not happy with the plan cost, but the iPhone is a huge improvement over the Rise (of course it costs 10x as much). If I had it to do over again, I would save for the iPhone 5 on Virgin. But when the contract is up, I will go back to Virgin. I just hope the $35 per month deal is still around then. My wife still has the Rise, and she uses it everyday. It still crashes at least 2 or 3 times per day. Sadly, I would no longer recommend the Rise.","January 2, 2013",
mobile phone,OK phone; camera stinks!,George,R2YPLQ712UU5T2,3,"I got this phone after reading the mostly positve reviews. After two weeks, I have no major complaints except for the poor network reception. Sprint (Virgin) is a poor substitute for Verizon, my previous carrier, atleast in the SF Bay Area. I really like the qwerty keyboard and bought a cheap spare battery from Amazon. A replaceable battery is hard to find in phones anymore. One definate 'con' is the camera. The pictures are poor, even at the best settings with good light. The flash is weak compared to other phones making indoor pictures very difficult. The video is limited to 800x460. If you want a phone with a descent camera this is not for you. If you buy a phone for talk, data or text, this is a bargain.","December 18, 2012",
mobile phone,"Keep in mind, it's an ENTRY LEVEL smartphone..",tessmi7,R2LCF99VBZRG3C,3,"The Kyocera Rise isn't a bad phone at all. However, for those looking for top-notch smartphones, look elsewhere. It's a very simple phone with a great overall design and features. I LOVE qwerty-keyboard phones, including this one; unfortunately, I tend to sling the slide-out keyboard around, which definitely affected this phone. The keyboard began to disconnect from the phone itself and eventually affected the screen. I had to tape the keyboard to the phone to keep it from messing up the screen and falling off altogether. This was my fault as a user, but if you're like me and just sling the keyboard in and out (especially with lots of texting), beware!If you're looking for a simple smartphone with a qwerty-keyboard that you can use lightly, this is a great phone, especially for the price. Virgin Mobile is an awesome provider as well.","October 1, 2013",
mobile phone,Good phone if it works,"Stanjj111 ""stanjj""",R1BAFK3OQSZI99,3,"I purchased a Kyocera Rise after I lost my phone. This was my only option with Virgin Mobile that I saw because I like a QWERTY keyboard.This item was purchased in a box store and I was glad that I did. I had to return the phone several times before I got it to work now (I think). My phone would work initially but after a short while on my first phone the sound stopped working. I could only make phone calls on the speaker mode and the music would not play. The store manager suggested that I get a new phone.The second one had a similar problem. This was very strange. Customer service in Manila was useless. Everyone I spoke to said are you sure the volume is on (which it was). I am not that ignorant. I finally got someone in Virgin Mobile who indicated that if I obtained some info from the box store they would send me a new phone (not a refurbished one) because the item was less than a month old. Everyone said that it was a hardware problem and not software incompatability.Instead, I went to another box store with same company and they set up the phone. After one day it happened again so I took out the battery and reset the phone to the factory initial settings. After each addition or change in the phone, such as adding programs, moving programs to the sd card etc. demonstrated that the phone appears to be working well.After much soul searching I think that the problem was that the case was not closed completely and somehow this caused an interruption in service.No one in customer service or the store was able to help but when I mentioned this to the store mgr. he said that this was a possible cause of the errors that I was getting.I understand that this is a midrange product and should expect it behaves as such. Now the phone seems to be working well (3 days).I like this Android system as it is better than the 2.3 version that I was using in the past. Some general comments about this phone:The camera is weak in terms of color balance and the video could be clearer but they work adequately.I put in a 16GB card and for my uses this is fine.The volume is now working well.As others have mentioned the top level of the keyboard is too close to the screen.I do not like the fact that the fn functions needs to be activated each time that a number needs to be added.I do not like the fact that the Essentials program needs to be added. I would much rather have choices as to what programs to add. However, with the memory on the phone and moving all the apps to the sd card this issue hopefully will not be an issueI called Kyocera technical service trying to ask about this issue and determine whether this is a defect in their product. The person on the line refused to answer and directed me to Virgin Mobile. Not much help at all.","March 19, 2013",
mobile phone,Loving it!! (NOT ANYMORE!!),Michelle Rothfeldt,R39TVPEMOU2OUJ,3,"I am really happy with this phone so far. What a huge difference from the one I had (Samsung Intercept Android Phone)! It's fast, it's easy to use, and you can't beat the price. I shopped around, ALOT, was considering going with a plan but comparably, this is the best phone for the price. Doesn't have a front-facing camera, but that's not really necessary as far as I'm concerned.UPDATE: 04/14/13Now that I have owned this phone for a few months, I am having more and more issues with it. It freezes, ALOT.. sometimes it resets itself out of the blue. I also have frequent trouble with reception and connecting to the Internet and social media groups.

We both upgraded the SD card to 32GB and have the ""app2sd"" app installed on our phones,Kyocera Rise Prepaid Android Phone (Virgin Mobile) yet it has not helped at all.

mobile phone,I have a love/hate relationship with this phone...,ShellyB1202,RBF8W3HXSIFKL,3,"I loved it when I first got it, now I hate it.It was my very first smartphone, so I thought it was the greatest thing ever for the first couple of weeks...now, not so much. I'm looking for a new phone already. I have had it for less than 1 month.I would recommend purchasing this model if you do not want to do too much with it. It works great for texting. The keyboard keys are a little sticky, especially the space bar, but maybe they will wear down. The call quality is good. If you have a good wifi connection, the phone runs great on the internet, but the Virgin 3g connection is awful. I get a maximum of 1 bar no matter where I am, and I live in an area that, according to their coverage map, is fully covered. I am not planning on paying for another month of service at the moment. I will try the free text/call apps on my home wifi network.My main gripe right now, and the reason that I decided to write this review, is that the phone turns itself to silent on its own. I have no idea why, or how to fix it. I can go to settings, and everything is fine - silent and airplane modes are OFF, ringtone and notification tones are set, volume is as loud as it will go, vibrate is ON...yet when someone calls, texts, or I get any other notification, the phone does not make a sound or vibrate. This is VERY frustrating. It stays like this for hours, or days. This is a deal breaker. I NEED to hear my phone.My next gripe is that there are a lot of apps that I had planned on using with this phone that are not compatible with this model. I wanted to try Shopkick and Ibotta, they will not work. Jingit just barely works...the camera is not auto-focus and the picture quality is horrible, so I cannot do my check ins. The flash makes everything a funny color as well.Also, with the apps, the phone freezes A LOT. I cannot tell you how frustrating this is when you are in the middle of an EPIC Ruzzle match. All you can do is shut the phone off and restart it. Boo!!!I know this is not the fault of the phone, but Adobe flash is not supported, so I cannot watch some videos/movies on the phone.I DO like the size, shape, and weight of the phone. I am not a fan of the super skinny or tiny phones, and I HATE touch screen keyboards, so the QWERTY slider out keyboard is perfect for me. Again, it's a great phone if you aren't planning to do much besides call, text and wifi web browsing. Other than that, you're going to need something better.","January 24, 2013",

mobile phone,It's so-so: for me the volume button works too easily,Gisela Hausmann,R3L23HFPPEVDI6,3,"First of all I'd like to point out that I am not one of the people, who handle their lives with their phones. This comment is supposed to clarify that I am not a cell phone whiz.Here is what I LOVE: The screen is crystal clear and beautiful. Even though I do not have a cover it has not gotten scratched in the four months I have owned this phone. Obviously, I handle every phone the same way, and this is the first one, whose screen does not scratch easily.The camera makes very nice pictures.The keyboard is very nice, I like how the keys are spaced apart.Here is what I hate about this phone:The volume button on the left hand side works at easy or even accidental touch. Thus, inadvertently, the user can turn down the volume of the ringer without even noticing. In fact that is what happened to me non-stop when I got the phone. My previous phone had been an LG Rumor Slider. On that phone as user has to actually press the button vs simply touching, and only then the volume of the ringer would change. Personally I found this a lot better. Now, after 4 months of using the phone I have actually gotten used to this and check my phone's sound volume all the time. Naturally, I find it annoying. Since I love this phone's screen I would hope that somebody fixes this issue.Gisela Hausmann, author & blogger","September 28, 2013",

But whatever I am trying to enter with typing seems to disappear from vertical to horizontal and I can't use anything on it. It is probably a fine phone, but not for the challenged (that's me) - and they are all frustrating - the screen is smaller than I like and trying to read or see anything is very difficult, no - impossible - for me.

mobile phone,Good starter for Android OS 4.0,Collin Henderson,R283C2DY60Y7R,3,"I purchased this phone at Target, actually, but that doesn't mean I'm unable to write a review on it. For the most part, it's pretty good. It's got one gig of internal storage memory, so you can download a few apps, which is great! It processing speed is 1 gig, also good. I'm not sure about it's RAM; I could take another look at it. The call quality is good and it's great for texting. The MAJOR downside for me was that I was unable to get the browser or Play Store to work on Wi-Fi. Maybe I was in a weak Wi-Fi, but I always thought a university would make a good Wi-Fi spot. However, overall, it's good for starting with the Ice Cream Sandwich(Android 4.0) operating system; but I'd make a quick upgrade to a better phone that could get on Wi-Fi. It's voice-to-text is actually pretty weak as well; but I didn't expect that much from a Kyocera in terms of that.

I keep reminding myself that it does this because, afterall, it IS basically a handheld computer. This phone does not take the best pics at night, and under lowlightconditions, but I would not say it's that bad. What irritates me is the speaker feature-no matter when I use it,the person on the other end will say that they cannot understand me unless I take it off speaker mode. It also shutsitself off at random (when not in use) and restart itself. Perhaps this is just what some smartphones do as a way toautomatically update firmware? Many of the games I have downloaded will freeze also, like Uno friends and Dots, butthis may be a problem with the games themselves, and not the phone.

mobile phone,Bluetooth and Phone Reception not Very Good,"L. Coleman ""Geek Girl""",R4GDI0DO5NSJ3,3,"Overall the phone is not too bad. There are several pros and cons to getting this phone and for me the cons were enough for me to return the phone to Amazon. I really wanted to love the phone but it didn't work out for me. One of the major issues I had with the Kyocera Rise was that I got horrible reception. I don't know if the city that I'm just doesn't have enough towers or what, but I have experienced so many dropped calls with this phone. There were many occasions that my family and friends couldn't hear me at all during a call because of the poor reception. The Qwerty slide out keyboard buttons sometimes didn't respond right way and the touchscreen keyboard was too sensitive most the time.One of the other reasons why I returned this phone was because the Bluetooth didn't work well with my car. I have a 2012 Chrysler Town and Country with the uConnect System and this phone never could keep a good connection. It was so poor. I was able to receive calls through uConnect but never could make any calls through the system. It would always tell me that I had a bad connection or it will dial a telephone number and then say that the call was complete but then disconnect immediately. I really wanted the Kyocera Rise to work properly with uConnect so I wouldn't have to worry about using a Bluetooth headset.I'm not sure if the unit that I received was merely a dud, but I didn't want to take the chance of getting a replacement and going through this all over again so I just returned it. The phone does have some positives which earned it three stars. The positive features are the following:1. Ice Cream Sandwich Firmware2. Pretty fast at switching applications3. A good amount of internal storage and plenty of space on the SD Card that's provided4. Very sturdy and small enough to fit in your pocket5. It doesn't have too much bloat ware6. Activation and setup was fairly easyI wouldn't recommend this phone for a heavy user however this is an excellent phone for those people who are new to smart phones.","March 14, 2013",
mobile phone,Great at first but showing flaws,Tyler Turcotte,R195QBXHGNV1AN,3,"Looking to upgrade from the abysmal Samsung Intercept, I looked to the newest decently-priced smart phone from Virgin Mobile. The look and feel is great; light, sleek, and fairly thin. The boot-up time, battery life, responsiveness, and display were all significantly better than the Intercept. However, it didn't take too long for the random reboots, freezing apps, and unresponsive menus to return. Although on a lesser level than the Intercept, this phone still suffers from issues plaguing most inexpensive smartphones. It's certainly tolerable, but disappointing nonetheless. I'd still recommend this to anyone looking for an entry level smartphone, but don't expect it to be perfect. You get what you pay for.","March 14, 2013",
mobile phone,Good replacement phone,Devon Beliveau,R1CNY73UZQ1CZS,3,"Got the phone but a few qualities of it I did not like. Battery life is slim, the power button is in the way of the keyboard so when you open the phone the keyboard to txt, you might accidently push the power button (pretty annoying). Hoping it was 4g but the 3g is alright. Other then that its a great upgrade from the Motorola triumph.","March 2, 2013",
mobile phone,Started out nice then problems,"Goldencat ""Carla""",R3BW4D8BKTK9KB,3,"My second Rize phone (replacement) was okay but there was a definite learning curve for someone new to smartphones. The handbook isn't sufficient. You will need to go online to read the actual manual for most questions apart from ""idiot"" level info like what is a screen, where is the battery, this is the camera...etc.Tended to run hot when used continually an hour or two, as with a game, or continuous use of the navigator app. The plastic customizing case made it worse. It is seemingly fragile where it slides - I suppose those are hinges of a sort, I don't know the exact name. Anyhow, be careful taking off an added case, or removing the battery cover, so you don't damage the phone with too much pressure on the weak spots! Ladies, expect to break a nail removing either sort of case, if you hold the phone so as not to break IT instead.Phone has annoying habit of switching wi-fi to ""on"" by itself. Makes you wonder if Google or someone needs it to spy on you! It saves battery life to only use wifi when needed.The Virgin navigation app worked very well - I feel better having it, as a supplement to AAA maps and human given directions. I'd never ever want to depend on GPS entirely, as it doesn't know local conditions (construction, one way, detour)and its idea of ""direct"" may not be yours. You can spend too much time plotting courses with the trip planner option, and still not know what the GPS is steering you into, like terrain, how much toll roads are, traffic volume, etc. Still, handy if you miss a turn off or end up in a neighborhood where kids like to steal road signs!Phone IS heavy, more so then my billfold. (wish it were the reverse! lol) I definitely notice if it's in my coat pocket or purse. The contours are not hand-friendly. Ergonomically, it's just fair. Holding it to text hurts my hands after a short while - 15 minutes, say. Because the weight is more to the part of the phone above the keyboard, and puts a constant pull on your finger grip. As others have noted, the top row of keys is too close to the edge of the slid-away phone piece, making it awkward. Especially if you like to let your nails grow or- heaven forbid - get long acrylics. In that case use Swype instead.But then, if you don't need a keyboard - and like Swype - you don't need a slider phone, and can pick a lighter one.Most apps worked fine. Games were often too tiny to be playable, though Baby Dragons and Bubbleworld work ok. Action games definitely do not. Maybe for adolescent males with lots of Pepsi and testosterone, and young eyes...After less than a month of use, the replacement phone started having trouble freezing up in the middle of an app it previously ran okay, like AAA Trip Advisor, or the game Baby Dragons. Sometimes it locked the screen as I turned it (tilt sensor) and the screen was cockeyed and unresponsive, so I had to power it off if waiting didn't let it do what it needed to do. I am wondering if these were refurbs sold as new ... my first Rize had little scratches on the screen, and shut itself off sometimes. (but was mailed in unprotected yellow envelope)This one was boxed properly for shipping.Pictures were excellent. Exchanging pics with Bluetooth was not. Never did convince it to cooperate with my LG800 tracphone, or my other Rize. It would send but then - nothing. Or, data was too large and it just wouldn't send. Maybe a more savvy user could have made it work.Overall a good, affordable, smartphone with a few bugs - I think the Ice Cream Sandwich o/s may have some limits that just were not disclosed. Price mark is good (tho I'd call $25 more fair, as it used to be priced)$35 on unlimited text/data/300min, and can use Skype for extra minutes.","February 10, 2013",
mobile phone,So-so,"R. Correa ""siriusbro""",R17V8JX5ZRXY1W,3,"I do alot on my phone; browsing, emails, apps, texting. I needed a phone that could do this efficiently and reliably (and have a mp3 player, but it's pretty standard these days).In the first month, it had been not-so-great in it's performance. I live in a black hole of coverage area but the call clarity everywhere else has been satisfactory. I had a problem with it turning on unless I had it plugged in. A big problem. The phone seems to lag a little(I was a little upset bc it was ICS-an upgrade) but nothing unusually slow. The speaker and camera quality are excellent. Entering month six, there's some issues that I've decided warranted this review.Games like Angry Birds, etc. will lag like 50% of the time and force close on occasion. I think this is because like I said above, I live in a black hole for cell signal, ..buy why do I need any signal if the game is downloaded to my phone? I don't know if this is just my ignorance, but every time I remove the memory card (which I use as music storage) and then replace it, all my playlists are gone. Like others have wrote, the phone seems to reboot ALOT when it feels like it which is a distraction sometimes. People have complained about the battery but I feel some desire to say I haven't felt handicapped by it, but that might be because my life has me near a charger 10 hrs a day. But I've played with apps while listening to music in the back for 30-45 minutes at times and it hasn't drained the battery to low levels.Let my summarize this by saying that I'm the most fical person with phones I know. Taking a look, it was the perfect size for me, it was android, and I even liked the name. Awesome. However, the problem with the rebooting has become exponentially annoying. And the phone's ""par or worse"" performance with gaming seems like a cheat because this design is less than a year old. If there was a phone with exactly the same hardware and color on the market I'd consider trading, but I've given enough of my money to phone companies for now.","February 1, 2013",
mobile phone,It's an okay smartphone,Dill Pickles,RJ1AJ1759DB7V,3,"Most reviewers have already said it, but this phone is fine for the price. It's a smartphone. It can do smartphone things.After about a month it starts freezing and locking up and randomly restarting, but that has been my experience with all android phones.Personally I was tired of buying a new android phone literally every 3 months, so I finally got an iPhone 4s and absolutely love it. And I REALLY don't like apple. But the 4s is $450 without insurance, whereas this phone does basic phone things fine for only $100.If you need a cheap phone with a keyboard, I recommend this phone.

mobile phone,Kyocera Rise is OK,"E. Johnson ""-e-""",R1CCGF08PMKTGS,3,"This is great for anyone new to Android and wants an inexpensive touchscreen phone. Out of the box, it was hard to see in the daylight and had poor battery life. To fix the daylight visibility, go into the display settings and turn off the automatic brightness feature (then set the brightness to whatever you like). To conserve battery power, go into the eco mode settings and activate each ""leaf"", except for the 15sec sleep and the auto-rotate option. You should have 4 out of 6 ""leaf"" ratings. The battery should last normal now, unless you constantly play games or videos all day. Three major drawbacks: no memopad, no ""to-do"" list, and videos can stutter or stall (not sure if it's the phone or Virgin's network). Got it on sale for $30 so I'm not really complaining.

mobile phone,Works in some ways but not in others.,Brycen Edwards,R1Z09Q5KW5QK41,3,"This phone fell apart after 6 months of use. Literally came apart in two pieces held together by a piece of cable that powered and talked to the keyboard. It had a lot of problems constantly crashing and needing rebooting. It sometimes randomly rebooted in the middle of the night even while I was asleep and not using it. It would wake me up with all the noises it makes upon restart.It did have a lot of space.It ran pretty much most of the programs I wanted it to run except the uno game that previously ran on my Motorola slider phone I had with Verizon a few years back. I was disappointed cause outside of Solitare, Uno is a favorite before bed activity. I replaced it with a lg slider from straight talk that they run for $20 all the time. Which ran stable but had no space for apps. It could barely call itself an android. So in the end all the shottiness of the rise construction wise I miss it deeply. The sad thing is they do not cater to those of us who prefer the qwerty keyboard on our phones for messaging. We get new better models last. I hate on screen keyboard options. I love the slider keyboard option I just want a bigger screen and more stable operation.","December 6, 2013",

It randomly freezes for no reason. I don't even have to touch the mike icon to get it to pop up and demand I speak again when I didn't speak the first time. I can look down at my phone and find it doing random stuff even when its locked against accidental key presses. I've had pauses in my music to find that my phone is calling someone even though I never touched the phone icon. There are some good points like being able to do research from the comfort of my bed,synched email accounts so I don't have to sign in to each individually,lots of free apps in the app store, lots of space for all my apps.

I don't consider this phone a move up. My email is easy to check, and the camera works pretty well, even has a flash, other that that, ick. I can't imagine this phone without the slide out keyboard, it would be impossible to hit those tiny onscreen keys, if you have big guy hands forget it. Even the slide out is awkward on the top row you have to turn thumbs sideways. Typing on the browser is crazy hard too I finally had to go to lycos to do a search because google and yahoo were so hard to get to work because pressing the small text is so hard even with my girl pinkys. Texting isn't great. ANd Delete the ID's thing off the main screen, I accidently, or it did it on it's own, downloaded an ID and I had no choice then but to hit install and it wiped out my layout. It is not very intuitive, it has taken me weeks to find the simplest changes (like the rigntone for texts). It is such small things wrong with this phone but they are huge in the annoying scale. Since this is my first smartphone I don't know if it's just this phone that kind of sucks or all smartphones. DIdn't buy it from here got it on sale at Walmart for like 75$ but the plan is great with unlimited texting (which I hardly use now since it's so messed up) and unlimited data for $35 a month.

My main reason for buying this was for Android 4.1, the screen size and lightness of the phone, but the quality is falling thru, it's wearing really bad the paint and plastic is cracking and wearing from normal use, I would not recommend this to any one. Also the screens viewing angle isn't that great, at certain angles the pictures color inverts. The camera quality is only about 2 megapixels also if you use T Mobile like I am you will not get 3G on your phone but only edge service but phones quality for phone calls is great but that's about it. The phone also reaches really high temperatures and can burn you, an app I use tells me that the highest temperature I've reached was 124 Fahrenheit. Also I won't ever go with a no name phone again because I can't find a case that fits correctly it seems to be too big for the cases . If you're using the phone with AT&T; you will get good 3G signal which is awesome on this phone, all in all I won't buy again but not a terrible smartphone just not that good. I hope my reviews help you to make a wise decision when buying a phone sometimes its worth it just to buy a name brand phone, originally planned on going with the Nexus 4 but couldn't pay for it at the time.

I contacted the seller who replied quickly with the suggestion to ""short press"" the control. Not sure what that means. But the only way I was able to get the volume to work was by installing a 3rd party app, but that ended up being too much of a pain to adjust when on a call. Other than that the phone was good. It was of ""Knock Off"" quality, but good for the price.I'm sure if I would have replaced it with another that the replacement would have been fine. The only other issue I had with it, and it's a minor one, was with the Page Dots (I have no idea what they're actually called. The 5 or 6 dots on the bottom you can touch to rotate to a given page.) I was only able to swipe the screen to turn the page. Touching the dots did not work like it does on my Galaxy S III work phone. I admit that I do not know if that is by design or if it's another flaw with the phone I had.In the end I decided to return it and get a real Samsung Galaxy S III (mini) for $150 more.

Should have just spent the extra money at first! PEOPLE! it will impress you for the first little bit, then it will make you want to slam it into a wall-HARD.UPDATE!!!! Had the phone for several months now. Found a gel cover from china that fits it finally. Dropped it, broke the screen, but it still works so I'm good with that. Really bugs me cause I take great care of my stuff and have never broken a phone. It still goes off alot, still freezes up. New annoyance is NO storage, and it will no hold a charge. I'm not the kind of person that has 30apps and music, I have 5 apps, that's it. If I knew then what I do now, probably would have passed. But I have noticed alot of bad comments about customer service, I got mine at lolbuy, and they have been awesome and always fast to respond. If your going to try it, get it from them.I like this phone OK. Take into consideration I have been using a blackberry for 4+ years however and this is a total change for me. I had to have a phone compatible with straight talk thus the blackberry had to go. This phone is fast, web is great. Love the voice command option and talk to txt. It actually understands me, southern drawl included. I hate texting on it, but I hate txting on any touch screen, again, I had a blackberry. Had some issues with it, and daniel chen was very promt in his reply. Most Issue's are resolved, but some are still there. It freezes up and you have to take the battery out over and over until it decides to come back on and very very often it will not sent txt msg, rather give me an error msg. I have no clue how to fix this, i'm thinking it's just not set to keep trying to send it if the other person is out of range or something, idk. And as far as the freezing up, I watched a friend of mine with a ""real"" samsung having the same problem. Camera and speaker are not great. Overall, Its worth the money. I would buy it again. Shipping was super fast from lol buy and it was packaged very very well. Took me 10min's just to open it.

The flash isn't very good unless your close up flashing it at something. Even the screen gives off more brightness than the flash . Also the Bluetooth didn't work. At first it would pair but after a few minutes it would no longer connect through Bluetooth anymore. I wasn't expecting a great phone, but I think it could of at least had a good touch calibration.

mobile phone,I THINK I COULD'VE DID BETTER,Me,RCT0J4L0G4UU,3,"When I first got this phone I was very excited, but as I used it, it began to give me problems. For one, the battery life isn't that great, but I thought it was because I was using apps, texting, and talking on it so much. Maybe it's because I use my phone a lot, but I didn't think that the phone would continue to die every hour, I don't use it THAT MUCH. Secondly, my sync on my phone keeps having issues. One minute the sync says it's working, and everything is fine, and the next it's not and I can hardly use ANY of my social networking apps (Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, etc.)Sometimes the sync says everything is working, and I STILL seem to be having problems with those apps; that's really my biggest problem with this phone. Also, this phone seems to be very sensitive, so if I'm making a phone call if I press my face against the phone it seems to hang up on the person I'm speaking to at the moment, which causes problems for me. Also, when I'm making a phone call, sometimes I can't hear the person on the other line, and when I call them back, I'm able to hear them. Furthermore, when I'm making a phone call, I tend to hear static when making the call. The volume isn't that great after a while either. I really wouldn't recommend this phone, and honestly, I wish I would've waited to get another phone and just continued to save my money to get another android, but I hope that I'll be able to figure out how to make this phone work better. When it works it works well, but it's not consistent enough for me, so that's why I have so many problems with it. On the plus side, the phone is large, which I love, and also it did save me a good handful of money at the time, but again, I do wish I would've waited.","June 20, 2013",

mobile phone,It's an OK phone,DJ,R3JVBPXJW395M2,3,"Well, I just received this phone yesterday (bought it from a seller on eBay for $169.99) and it's OK. I have never bought a ""budget"" phone before, so I'm trying to get used to the generic feel of it. Please do not expect Galaxy S4/iPhone 5 features in a $140.00 phone. The iPhone 5/Galaxy S4 it is not. But for the price, it is what it is. I like the fact that you can use TWO SIM cards. I have been a T-Mobile Pay As You Go prepaid customer since '06 (I have over 800 minutes that do not expire until 3/28/14). I inserted my SIM card into one of the slots and the phone worked with T-Mo's PAYG service right out of the box. I just signed up for T-Mo's $30 a month unlimited data/text with 100 minutes plan. I inserted my SECOND SIM card into the phone's second SIM slot, went to ""SIM Management,"" turned on ""data"" and it worked too. Texts, pictures, data --- EVERYTHING works (I hope I didn't just jinx myself). I use the minutes I have on T-Mo's PAYG plan to talk and use the $30 unlimited monthly plan for pics, texts and data. The internet is REALLY slow, though. I read Marie's review and she said internet speed improved after a while, so I'm hoping the same will happen for me. So far, the phone is working as advertised. That's all I can say about it. Good luck.","April 27, 2013",

I was disappointed that there were no cases for this ph. the only ones were the flip open ones and only like 2 colors of hard back cases. I tried cases for the galaxy note and they didn't fit. one good thing is that this phone comes with a regular battery back and a flip battery back, and it comes with a screen protector installed. overall the phone functions ok and it will do the job, but I personally didn't feel like it was good enough. if you want a pretty looking phone with basic features than this will probly be ok for you.","August 7, 2013",

It would not allow me to do anything but click the side button to bring up the power off menu but I couldn't click anything. I took the battery out several times and it would power back on but I could not unlock the screen. Like it did not even know I was touching it. I let it charge for awhile and started to activate it on the computer but it still wasn't registering responding. It managed to activate and I received a message that I couldn't get to. Finally when I went to write an email to the seller it decided to work perfectly and have not had so much as a glitch since and it is running beautifully. It has great sound, great pic resolution, though the camera is a bit weird indoors sometimes. I haven't figured out how to get the internet working with the APN settings but I'm calling straight talk tomorrow to see exactly what they need to be.

mobile phone,Not For the Faint Hearted - Changing Platforms: From Blackberry to Google,"4Nbahu ""Free Book Hunter""",R3L12UHM8AV0K5,3,"ETA Update August 18, 2013 (used phone for three months in India)I've lowered the rating from 4 to 3. I am one of the lucky ones I haven't dropped the phone, nor has it slid off of counter, so it is in the same shape as purchased. I use a bumper at all times. I tried the case flip cover thing, but it annoyed me too much to continue with it.I still find the ease of seeing all of my accounts. Once I realized how to use the three different methods of finding a phone number to call and how one of them can be used similar to a speed dialing, I became less agitated as I didn't have to go through so many screens to make a simple phone call.Compared to my son's Samsung Galaxy I find the photo quality lacking. The camera itself is fairly easy to use but I have seen better.My main issue is sound. It is so limited. I realize the speakers are on the back but this wouldn't have to be a big deal if I could put the volume up. Even while talking the other person's voice is often very faint.In addition, even being in an urban setting my phone is often unable to catch a signal. I could blame my carrier, but I will be sitting next to someone with the same carrier and they have 5 bars while mine sits on 2 or even none.The worst is the number of times I have pocket dialed someone. Unless I insure the screen is locked or the phone screen is on the number pad screen any stray movement can cause the phone to dial out. I have made several accidental calls just when trying to hang up the phone. Once the red is gone if my finger is anywhere on the screen I call someone. One of these days it is going to cause me great embarrassment.I wish I had known the HTC version was coming out when I purchased this. I would have waited and compared. As it is, my friend is very happy with his HTC Google phone.I will continue to use the LG Google phone, but I don't think I will keep it the five years as I have done on my other phone. The first real excuse I can find and it is gone.ORIGINAL REVIEW ORIGINAL REVIEW ORIGINAL REVIEW ORIGINAL REVIEW ORIGINAL REVIEW ORIGINAL REVIEWI am not a techno geek, just someone who likes to use all of the bells and whistles. I am not one to upgrade for the sake of having the latest and greatest, I had my blackberry for at least three years and would probably be still using it if I hadn't dropped it for the umpteenth time.When I realized my phone was dying about two months ago I started the process of researching. In my house we have the iPhone5, the Samsung Galaxy3, Nokias, Blackberrys, and have owned many others. As I live in India I had shortlisted down to iPhone5 and the Samsung as these were readily available. I was leaning towards the Samsung when I asked my nephews opinion. He told me forget everything else and just get the Nexus. After more research that is what I did.The first order of business was that my old, very old sim was too big for Nexus. It was even too big to be cut down and so I had to go to Airtel which for Rs 25 gave me a new micro sim within 5 minutes and even installed it for me. I wish everything else had been so easy.When I first turned on the phone, I was walked through many of the usual set ups. The major problem came when the first time the phone rang. As I had never used a phone touch screen before, I didn't realize that I just needed to swipe my finger from left to right over the little circle. I missed a lot of calls before I went to the forums and found out that I wasn't the only one wishing there was a how-to booklet in the box.I have now been using the phone for over two weeks. I have learned to answer the phone and learned how to find all the messages by pulling down the front screen. I've learned that there are some exciting things such as the maps that can navigate even in Haryana. I have all of my email account and social networking apps installed. I can surf, and search. I have learned to appreciate the cards that pop up with timely information.I have learned to swipe write, still have mistakes but it has made writing texts so much easier to swipe from letter to letter like cursive texting than to try and hit teeny tiny buttons with my big fingers.I was first taken aback when a Picasa album that I had made years ago and forgotten about appeared in my gallery. This is when I truly realized the power of having a Google phone. I am still discovering, but I look at it as an adventure.There are some things I'm still not happy with. The lack of any documentation is deplorable. I realize that many already understand the concepts, but some of us newbies and converts would like to know what all the bells and whistles are without having to resort to the forums. I thought I had loaded my music onto my phone, but somehow I am unable to access any of it. When I have time I will research what I am doing wrong.I thought I would be able to convert all of my contacts from Outlook to the phone. That doesn't happen. I put all of my blackberry contacts into my Google Account and then synched. There may be an easier way, but I couldn't find it on the forums.There is no mute button. I realize that is a small thing, but when you have forgotten to turn the volume all the way down and you get a call at the most inopportune time, it is an issue.So while I haven't learned all the bells and whistles, I am looking forward to the adventure of finding them.If you only use your phone for calls, texts and perhaps an email account, I would recommend that you find a more basic phone. If you can't take the time to learn and research don't get this. While many of the things are intuitive, I know I am missing out on some fun things.However, if you have the fortitude and the desire to have a phone that can really be that personal attendant and not just a telephone. Then this is the way to go.I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS PHONE.ETA: Have discovered that my wma files cannot be used on an android. I now have to convert my music to a usable format. Good thing vacation is coming up.","May 21, 2013",
mobile phone,Innovative with lots of bugs,D. May,R1QD93XLCXGAYW,3,"I'm a committed Google product user. I've been using Google for 13 years and would never consider a different brand if Google has the product. However, I live in an area with no cell reception so this is the first time I ever used any smartphone. This puts me in a unique position to list the bugs which make the Google Nexus 4 so hard to learn. I need a place to keep a running list of bugs as I encounter them.1. The entry of user name and password is so difficult that I've given up trying to do it without a Blue Tooth keyboard, and even then it takes several attempts. The following are the bugs only associated with this problem. 1a: The ""Show Password"" check box is on a different screen than the password entry screen. By the time you get the wrong username/password message, you can't go back and look at what you entered. 1b: When you set ""Show Password"" it often lapses back into the no show mode. 1c: The on screen keyboard is too small for people with big fingers, and there's room on the password entry screen to solve this problem for the limited case of user name/password entry. 1d. The username/password characters that you type are often forgotten before you can complete entry. 1e. The phone does not include a stylus which is needed to get started. I have not yet found any household material that will do as a stylus. I ordered a stylus from Amazon, and neither end of the stylus would work on this phone. 1f. There is no undo. While you can't undo a call, for example, there is a need for an undo when entering username/password. 1g. There are error modes when your finger lands slightly off target or on 2 keys, where the whole screen changes, and you can't get back, and by the time you do, what you typed is gone.2. The battery screen gives %, and ""time on battery"" but does not say if these refer to power and time USED or LEFT (remaining), or perhaps the charging efficiency. Between the battery, the charger, the cable, your power outlet, the message system, wireless or wired charger, and if you are using a case, there are many variables and you need to know what Google is attempting to display. 2a. This bug is compounded by the fact that the % does not always update when you select REFRESH. 2b. This bug is compounded by the lack of little blue '?' symbols that let you know what these numbers are measuring. I'm still trying to figure out if my wireless charger works the same through a case, and knowing what the numbers mean may help.3. Camera. The camera will take Spherical Pictures and upload them to Google+, and allow viewers to explore the photo like an ant walking on the inside of a photo sphere. This type of photo is commonly seen on realestate sites; but now its on the phone and easy. However, I'm finding bugs. 3a. It is not obvious how to exit camera mode. There's a secret spot on the screen that has no label or icon that you have to touch to get out of camera mode. Each little gotcha like this requires a Google search to learn what should be obvious. 3b. I love my spherical pictures, especially when I can use INSTANT UPLOAD and view them on my PC monitor. Only problem is that sometimes Instant Upload works, and sometimes it doesn't. This is no doubt due to the fact that you have to turn on instant upload in some menu that is so buried that once you find it, its hard to get lucky twice. The Instant Upload command should be located on the camera screen as well is buried deep within the menu structure. There also may be other things that must be set ? 3c. There is a screen with 8 different things to set to get camera uploads to Google+. With some settings, there has to be a check mark next to the selected alternative. With some, setting an option changes the text to say what option you selected. For one there is a barely visible check box that selects the option. This is hopelessly confusing, and I still only get some of my instant uploads.I will be adding and subtracting this list as I climb Google's first product with a steep learning curve.All this being said, I would never consider getting a different phone and there are many innovations including important innovations in photography. The phone would be well worth the money to me even if I only used the camera. So I give it 6 stars for innovation and important new inventions, but one star for having too many bugs.","April 24, 2013",

I've been using a Samsung Focus i917 Windows Phone for the last few years.I *REALLY* miss Microsoft's Zune software. This is used for syncing music, photos, and video between the phone and a PC. I like it a lot more than Google Music. With Google Music, you have to upload your collection to their servers, and then download the items back to your phone. Zune can perform the sync between the PC and phone over the local wifi network.I also miss the Focus AMOLED screen when viewing the screen out in the sunlight.The Focus has the USB and audio ports at the top edge of the phone. The N4 has the audio on top and the USB on the bottom; this is awkward when I've got both connected.I miss the Windows Phone metro style interface; the there seems to be more consistent UI conventions across metro apps.Besides these issues, the phone is pretty awesome.","September 15, 2013",

If you are wanting a phone that is WAY better than the flip phone you previously had through Tracfone (plus triple minutes for life!) than it is well worth the $45.00. I've been a tracfone guy for 10 years. I have a land line, I have a computer at work & home and a laptop I can travel with. I don't talk on the phone or text that much (200 minutes a month if I'm lucky). I just couldn't justify a REAL smart phone like an Iphone or droid and a $50+ a month bill when i'm paying less than $15 now. I mainly got this phone because frankly I was embarrased to be seen talking on my flip phone and texting was a joke without a keyboard.

I loaded my Mp3's on it, can take pictures and video and it LOOKS like everybody elses smartphone. It doesn't have some features that I would have liked like voice activated dialing and some other things. The real thing I don't like is the fact that when a call comes in it becomes ""unlocked"", you don't have to finger slide it to unlock it like my wife's smartphone so it is easy to accidently either answer it without wanting to or reject call just by reaching into your pocket to grab it. I could have switched to Virgin and paid $35.00 a month and $400 for an Iphone but for my line of work where I am in the office most of the time and next to my computer it really doesn't make sense at this time, maybe someday, but for now I'm happy with my $45.00 aquisition.","March 12, 2013",
mobile phone,Problems with tracfone,Donna Hering,R3VCB9W18MR63G,3,"I really do like this phone which I have had for about 3 months, however I cannot recommend that anybody gets a tracfone right now. The company is stealing my minutes like hot cakes! Seriously, I liked the phone so much that I bought another phone for my husband to keep in his car and I was charging it for him. After the charge, the phone gave a few beeps and I looked at it and it said 30 seconds deducted. I didn't do anything to the phone but charge it so no time should have been deducted. Anyway, this went on for at least an hour so I shut the phone off. This morning I turned it back on to see I had 45 seconds left then they were quickly deducted too. Then I was told my minutes had expired! Very strange so I called tracfone. An hour later, no resolution. After passing me to three people, They told me I had to call back in 72 hours. All I wanted is my 500 minutes back. So I googled and found out that a lot of people are currently having this problem with their tracfone and there are a lot of angry people out there like me. So I would hold off from using them until they clean up their act, which is too bad because tracfone is convenient and cheap if you don't use a cell phone a lot.","November 16, 2013",
mobile phone,Light of touch,dg,RS1SNDFZKJFCM,3,"My first experience with a 'smart' phone. The finger touch is very very light and subject to incorrect entries. Even the slightest pass over the face will activate some other application than intended.No QWERTY key board for new contact entries, notes, alerts and calendar reminders makes for the use of the old touch up to three times on a numerical key pad (telephone keys) for letter selection. That's really a pain and subject to multiple errors.Battery life is much less than previous experience. Be sure to charge it frequently.","February 7, 2013",
mobile phone,You gets what you pays for,Piltdown,R2DSOOQW4RZUCH,3,"Once it's up and running it's not a bad little phone, but transfering my old number and Safelink service could not be done with either the on-line or automated phone tools. I followed the automated instructions and activated the phone before transfering my existing number/service, and was then told by tech support that I had to get a new blank SIM card and do the transfer first. Tech support was dismal and barely coherent, until I tried calling at the night shift, and then was lucky enough to get someone who spoke clearly and was familiar with this phone's issues. Transfering the service required using ""Code Entry Mode"" to punch in long strings of numbers and characters recited by tech support. As other reviewers point out, this is not a smart phone, Wi-Fi connectivity is problematical and accessories like a carrying case are not yet available, but other features work well enough for the low price. Nice touch screen action, robust speaker, easy controls.","January 19, 2013",
mobile phone,Decent phone with a few note-worthy cons that might not matter to some users,"Beckmen ""Tim""",R2MN5ADBA7E7X,3,"Pros:-Wifi and 3g internet access-Bluetooth-Whatever network it uses is decent, rarely do I not get a signal or get dropped calls-Alarm clock, unit converter, tip calculator, notepad, MP3 player, calculator and bluetooth are nice features. Although it seems most; if not all; are pretty much standard on most phones these days-2gb MicroSD can hold a decent amount of pics and music, you can upgrade the card for failr cheap to add additional storage and installation is easy and toolless.-Browser and facebook apps make checking simple email and facebook stuff easy. The small screen limits the kind of browsing you can do, but simple and quick stuff is reasonableCons:-The camera is awful. Pretty much useless. Next to impossible to take a pic without massive motion blur and rolling shutter artifacts-The Java OS is pretty limited, I have yet to find any good time-wasting games for it.-It's a challenge to take it out of your pocket while it's ringing without hitting ""accept"" or ""reject"", which can be frustrating/ The screen unlocks itself when there is an incoming call.","December 12, 2013",

mobile phone,Overall a nice phone with a few exceptions,E. Richards,R2DGIDG9QZTF0U,3,"Overall, this is a decent phone. I bought it because Tracfone had refurbished models for 10$ and my keyboard on my other phone was kind of glitchy making texting a pain, so I thought I'd give it a try for that price. Basics: It has triple minutes (I buy 1500 tripling to 4500 once a year.) It is touch screen- no slide out keyboard which I wish it did have. Camera, video, works on GSM (AT&T;) towers. Wifi, bluetooth, a couple apps a 2GB micro SD card for music. It has a nice large screen that is easy to use and see, similar to using an iPod touch.Texting: this is basically what I use a phone for. You can make SMS texts up to 5 pages long, it sends them as so many pages but you don't have to start a new text every 160 characters. You can add a picture, music, video or other files to SMS texts, otherwise it will send them as SMS rather than MMS, it doesn't give you a choice which kind you want to send beforehand. As usual with tracfone you don't get to see who's texting you until you open it. I don't really like the touchscreen keyboard, I keep hitting the wrong keys. Also when you try to scroll through stuff like templates it's nearly impossible because every time you touch the screen it thinks you're selecting something. It has autocorrect, but I have that turned off. It's useful to have a stylus.Calling: If you live in an area with good AT&T; coverage calls are fine.Browser: I don't use this because it takes up tons of minutes and most websites don't actually work or show up correctly because there's not a real operating system. Works fine to check email or facebook messages though.Camera: Camera is 2MP but doesn't take great pictures. There's no zoom, unless you are using a low resolution, which is silly, why would you want to take low res photos to be able to zoom? There are lots of adjustable features, however, such as brightness, white balance, night mode, color effects like mono, sepia, negative, blue, a timer, normal or continuous shot mode. Plus you can edit pictures you've taken or downloaded with frames, flip, rotate, resize, add an image like a crown or a heart etc. to the photo, change the colors, adjust brightness, contrast, hue etc., add a filter such as sharpen, emboss, water color, sketch, neon, cartoon etc., draw with a pen, add text, crop, or add a stamp. You can also print via bluetooth.Video: Basically the same settings the camera has to take the video, plus the ability to zoom.Functions: Screen locks after a set period of time (you can adjust the amount of time) You push a button to turn the phone back on, and slide the lock up to unlock the screen. There's a ""home"" button at the bottom left on the screen. You can set contacts to shortcut to from the main screen, and you can set shortcuts to the widgets like email or messaging. There are also 4 buttons in a bar on the bottom of the home screen to make calls, go to contacts, go to texts or go to the widgets screen. You can scroll through widgets using this bar, or click on the apps button to go to the apps screen. If you don't want to add a widget to your shortcuts but want to easily access it for a period of time, you can slide it from the bar up to your wallpaper and it will stick on the main screen until you slide it back to the bar. These widgets include prepaid, where your phone/minutes info is located, contacts, messages, dialing, recent calls, games, calendar, camera, video camera, alarm, browser, settings where you can change the display, call, phone, and touch settings and sounds, email, SNS (facebook, twitter, myspace), voice recorder, file manager (photos, videos, music), pictures, music player, notepad, audio, video, sound settings, wi-fi, bluetooth, calculator, tip calculator, stopwatch, unit converter and tasks.Ringtones: You can add your own ringtones, but for some reason you are limited on file size. I put several ringtones on the phone that I'd had on my other phone, and all but 4 of them were blocked from being set as ringtones because the file size was too large, even though they were only about 16 seconds long and I'd used them as ringtones before. On my old phone, I kept the volume set at medium. I have this phone set all the way up and I can still barely hear it when I play the ringtones. It seems loud enough when the alarm goes off though.Contacts: You can add photo ids and ringtones and emails etc for specific contacts. But unlike every other phone I've ever used you have to crop the photo to a little square. You can move the square where you want on the photo, but you don't get to resize it the size of the square is what you get. Which is annoying. There are message and call icons next to the contact name in the list, so you don't have to click on them to send them stuff. And, as I said, you can add your frequent contacts to the shortcut on the home page and not have to go into contacts at all.Bluetooth: This works fine, I transferred several files between the phone and my computer as well as my other phones and had no problems.Case: I got a case because I like the colors, but you really don't need one for this phone. The screen isn't covered by a case anyway, and the back cover is textured so you don't see scratches or fingerprints for the most part. And a case is only going to give you minimal breakage protection.Battery: I still have a full charge though I've been playing with the phone for a few days. But I'm not a heavy user so I don't know how long it lasts with frequent calls/ texts because I just got it.There are tap sounds when you touch things on the touch screen that you can turn off or change.When you enter info into contacts etc, the default entry method is keypad, but you can change it to keyboard. You can also add things to your dictionary and change between English and Spanish languages.Managing calls: One of the reasons I liked the AT&T; phones I've had on tracfone was the ability to block numbers from calling or texting me, so I didn't keep getting the same sales calls etc. This phone does not have the option to do that. And the lack of that feature when it was on the other phones knocked it down a star, because it was one of the two selling points for choosing AT&T; over Verizon, along with being able to create multiple page SMS texts, if the network works equally well for both in your area.So overall, it seems like a decent phone. If you like touchscreen keyboards, AT&T;, and don't care about being able to block numbers (which you can't do on the Verizon phones either) or take good pictures, you should like it, especially if you get the refurbished phone for 10$. It has a 3 month return window and a 1 year warranty. Though it is quite disappointing to ""upgrade"" your phone after 2 years and have to take a step backwards in functionality on many of the uses. If you've never had any of the things this phone lacks, however, you'll probably be a lot more pleased with it.","September 23, 2013",
mobile phone,Read This For everything You Want to Know,Maxzis,R2LOL1ZGD1JFRJ,3,"In America Tracfone makes the most sense in the realm of prepaid carriers. They don't try to sale you anything besides their cheap phones and simple plans, and everything they sale does what it's suppose to and does it good. They have data that doesn't consume much minutes for ebuddy or browsing, long distance is 1-800 based and costs the same amount of minutes as local calls(although they don't cover some countries like Estonia); with a huge array of nations, and there are text messages, email, and voice-mail.Now, On to this phone..THE GOOD-Triple minutes for life-J2ME based Apps, Google Earth, lots of games that are functionally on par with Android and IOS games(for small screens), IM support through ebuddy client or site-2MP camera-VGA video recording-Good coverage-HTML+Javascript+SSL capable web browser-microSD card up to 32GB and verified up to class 2 speed-Bluetooth 2.1 with all the modes enabled(file transfer, audio, contacts, modem etc..)(modem probably doesn't work)-MP3 ringtones and media player(podcasts, music downloads etc..) with good sound even in cheap headphones, compared to my high end unlocked xperia-Nice geometry, nice back plate, lots of cases and plates to buy cheap-802.11a/b/g WIFI with WEP, WPA, WPA2 support-Good battery life-Fully functional microUSB port with the exception of host mode, which is commonTHE BAD-2MP camera is cheap legacy webcam grade with no type of stabilization and even with manual white balance and light configuration doesn't pick up most dark colors, and even when it does there is heavy grain, motion blur, and fringing-Web browser dies or reboots the phone OS when you browse too complex web pages. I suspect because the phone only uses RAM, which it has very little of, for rendering and cache for storage with no pagefile/swap; I've seen this before on Java based phones, I don't get why they would just let the OS reboot instead of coding in a RAM cache-No flash(kinda expected though)-Screen has extremely low PPI/DPI, color range, and if you look at it from even the slightest angle you see gray-Screen cover material not really scratch resistant, compared to even the first generation of gorilla glass-Bad analog circuitry on the headpphone jack, tested with all types of headphones. You get buzzing if you put pressure on the plug or cross headphone wires a certain way-I can't keep it on and locked in my pocket because somehow it dials emergency or my contacts sometimes. Holding volume or power unlocks it but how it gets to contacts or dialpad I don't know. I'd like to keep it on to check time at work but can't..SUMMARY: Unless you want to deal with the fees and maintenance and activation of the big carrier prepaid plans, go with Tracfone and go with this phone. Carry an internet device separately though that has flash and can handle any website; like a cheap tablet or 7"" netbook. You can actually likely use this phone as a modem for it over USB and BlueTooth. I don't text and only make 1-2 calls a day tops so I do the $9.99 online airtime a lot to conserve money.","August 22, 2013",
mobile phone,Decent but lacking,"hairballz ""hairballz""",R39GQYV3NNSLE9,3,"I've had this phone for about 4 months and I like it - have always been more impressed with LG products than any of the other Tracfone products I've tried (Motorola, Samsung). I got it primarily as an upgrade from a full qwerty LG I had previously, because I liked the more modern look/feel of this phone. The phone performs just fine, I use the phone, texting and alarm functions the most.However I REALLY miss the full qwerty keyboard and am seriously considering downgrading to get it back. Text messages at least gives you a keyboard to use, but if you use any other function (feeding in names into your contacts, trying to input anything on the web) it's a pain in the behind - a throwback to a decade ago for input.I also have NEVER had a Tracfone that had a good web interface. To call web browsing ""clunky"" is to be overly generous. It is so frustrating that I really don't even bother, from simple email to just doing a Google search it is so annoying I never end up sticking with it long enough to complete! If you know going in that you will just never be able to really use the internet on a Tracfone, then their phones are just fine - a bargain really! I have been a Tracfone user for over a decade and it is my only phone, dumped the landline years ago. But you really must own another device for web browsing - this just isn't it, whether it's this phone or any other in their stable.This phone, like any other Tracfones I've used, is pretty intuitive. They aren't fancy or complicated, which makes them really easy to use. You don't have to be a phone guru to use them, at ALL.Great for what it is.","February 25, 2013",

The problem I had with customer service is that none if the employees had a clue as to how to port my old cell phone number to the Tracfone. There is a feature on the Tracfone website that supposedly allows an existing phone number to be transfered to a new Tracfone. This feature is useless because after all the information is submitted nothing happens. After waiting three days for Tracfone to activate the phone, I called customer service. I was informed that I needed a different SIM card for the old number to be ported. After 5 days I received the new SIM card via FedEx. After installation of the new SIM card, the phone did not activate. I called Tracfone again and after being passed around 4 times to various people who did not have a clue on how to activate the phone, finally I was passed to a lady that told me that I needed to remove the new SIM card and reinstall the one that orgiinally came with the phone. She was able to activate the phone after 45 minutes of trying. I would recommend the phone only with the condition that it be shipped with a new working phone number. Do not attempt to have Tracfone port your existing number to a new phone.","May 19, 2013",

mobile phone,"Not a great phone, but good if you are cheap!",Jessica Bailey,R49CR00ZZHAZV,3,"My husband uses this phone- He is constantly losing phones, letting the batteries die, etc so I could not justify spending a lot on a phone for him. This phone is very slim and palm-sized so it fits neatly into pockets. It is a touch screen, and while it's not as responsive as more expensive models, my hubby has pretty large fingers and he is able to text on it fairly well. He's downloaded a few games but doesn't really use it for that purpose. Call quality is top notch, as with most Tracfones, it gets service everywhere, even in the backwoods of WV. The only qualm that my husband has mentioned would be that when he goes to retrieve it from his pocket he often accidently hits the ignore button on the touch screen and has to call the person back. It has a lock function on the top of the phone that you can activate but the screen activates itself when a call comes through. Sometimes in the process of digging it out of his pocket he presses the ignore button. Not really a big issue but kind of annoying. It has email capabilities and receives/sends picture messages (picture quality is decent, but looks grainy on the screen. I've sent them to my phone and printed them out and they actually aren't bad) but that normally burns up a lot of minutes so he rarely uses it. If it has a web browser he doesn't use it either. Tracfones are usually worthless in that regard. But if you like a cheap phone with triple minutes and a decent touch screen for texting, this is a good buy.","November 25, 2013",

Also, when I buy minutes, I don't always get the triple minutes or they go away on the next month's reset with Safelink. I have to call them every single month to resolve the issue.

Every time we have upgraded to a new phone, we have lost a BIG chunk of minutes. So, if you replace your Tracfone, be very careful to take a photo of the face of the old phone when the service date and minutes are displayed. That may make it a little easier to negotiate with the Tracfone operator and, if worst comes to worst, provide some proof if you need to consult with a state consumer protection agency to get all your minutes.

mobile phone,My first tracfone - great product! But costly minutes,A. Mitchell,R1D2P6H6TXRMX2,3,"After being a Verizon Wireless customer for YEARS, I'm wondering why I didn't jump ship sooner. I had wasted SO much money. Our bill was always over $200, sometimes $350, ridiculous! And even after I gave up my smart phone for a Samsung old flip phone, my bill was still $90/month. Wow.Anyway I have this now for a week and I just love being in control and paying only for what I use. In my line of work (I'm a graphic designer), I'm always in front of a desktop or a laptop anyway and trying not to be online when I'm away from work, so I have no need for a data plan. I don't need a smart phone with a data plan, just really need a decent-looking phone that is not a flip phone and this works for me. I'm happy that I will not get a bill, not tied to contracts, and no hidden surcharges. So refreshing.An update:So, the above was my review in the brief time I've owned the phone. And here's an update: I still like the phone because well the one it replaced was a Sprint flip phone. I changed my rating from 5 stars to only 3 stars now which is the median because whenever I receive a text, that's sometimes even broken up to more than 3 texts for some reason, well it removes .30 seconds per text I receive. So 2 texts received equals to one minute spent, and even though I'm hardly on the phone and I monitor my use tightly, it seems I end up spending about $29.99 worth of minutes every 2 weeks, so about $50 to $60 a month, mostly coming from unwanted incoming texts, ugh.To remedy this, I went to the tracfone website (did this tonight), and signed up for a value monthly plan, it seems the cheaper way to go..","December 16, 2013",

It sounded as though the person was standing in the waves on a beach. I believe it was the Philippines so it was an international connection. This required me to constantly ask the representative to repeat instructions. She was patient and after 45 minutes the problem was corrected. Something about the SIM card.Problem 2. I was going to travel and I wanted to access my email on the phone. Did all the set up instructions per the User Guide for the phone. Could not connect to my gmail account. Called customer service. Same problem with poor connection. To make a long sad story short after 50 minutes talking to numerous people a customer service supervisor told me they could not fix the problem and I would not be able to access my email on the phone.

The signal comes and goes even if you keep the phone in the same spot. The triple minutes is a plus, it will connect to our Wi-fi but not to our internet. Texting works great though. The tracfone technical support was not very helpful when I called regarding issues with signal. The website was worse. I would not recommend this phone for someone needing a reliable source of communication in a rural area with low signals.","October 6, 2013",

After a few calls with technical support, I found out you cannot call a cell phone internationally, only a landline. This was an important bit of information that is missing in their ads about international calling. Had I known this ahead of time, I would likely have not purchased the phone and stayed with my calling card. You can call a cell phone if it is in the USA which led to some of the confusion.","October 2, 2013",

mobile phone,A passable phone,T. ORourke,RU39US6B5054S,3,"I got this phone because it is supposed to be wifi capable and the price was right.So far, after days of hassle (perhaps just because I received it over Labor Day weekend), I got my old number transferred from Verizon (you have to call them and go through all the menus and hold for a person to get your account number from them if you pay as you go).The tracfone person was very helpful on the phone when I got someone on a business day; the prior 4 calls were a waste of time on the weekend. Calling is fine - much better reception than my old flip phone. Texting, which I hoped would be much easier, is more difficult than I thought as the touch screen is not that easy to use. Scrolling through my contacts, it constantly picks them as the one to send the message to: my brother-in-law and a friend got a text meant for my dad, but I am hoping to get better at it. The biggest disappointment is the wifi - it will not connect to my home network - tried it through every perambulation. I will do so again soon. There are some useful tidbits, but mostly I wanted something cheap I could potentially connect to wifi on in a pinch while traveling. We'll see.","September 10, 2013",

I had to enter several codes to verify that my phone was working. Then about an hour later the website updates and said that I would receive the phone number within four hours. I actually didn't receive the number until the next morning (about 8 hours later). I'd read several reviews and, if you have problems, the tech support is basically useless, especially when trying to transfer a number and minutes from another phone. I didn't even try to do transfer the number or minutes.The phone seems to work fine, but eats up alot of minutes whether a text/graphic goes through or not.

mobile phone,Does Not Connect Properly with Installed Car Bluetooth - Wrong Tracfone Carrier in My Area,C. Overhulser,R1TURD2GU150EX,3,Returned Item and received very prompt refund - the 1st problem was the carrier assigned by Tracfone. Tracfone uses T-Mobile and AT+T in my zip code area. But only T-Mobile has a usable signal at my home - They assigned AT+T - Tracfone Customer Service?? was no help at all - just kept telling me that was the correct carrier. The second problem was the LG phone would not connect reliably and stay connected to my In-Car Installed Blue Tooth (Motorola IHF1000). Motorola and Samsung phones connect properly and reliably so the Blue Tooth is fine. Tracfone Customer Service?? again was of no help - nor was LG Support- nor was Motorola Support on this issue - They all just kept pointing to each other. LG went so far as to blame another 3rd party software developer who writes the software for the Tracfone LG phones - said they (LG) only do the hardware. Finally gave up and sent it back -- Did get a fast refund. Probably would work OK in a strong signal area and possibly with LG BlueTooth.,"April 12, 2013",

I like the updated features from my 10 year old phone; however, I have always had great reception everywhere; however, this does NOT have the same reception for some reason. There are a LOT of places I go where I can no longer get service. I am also getting a lot of pop ups about my sims card not registered or not active when I try to turn on my phone in an area with little reception. That is VERY frustrating. The internet does work, but what is the point in pulling up ring tones, the internet lets you see ringtones you can buy; however, your internet does not let you listen to the ringtones.

mobile phone,LG-840 - NON ANDROID PHONE on Tracfone,"Bill ""Bill""",R27FGVFJEE0ODY,3,"I realized before purchasing that this was NOT an Android phone. That part was OK, as I wanted a phone to talk with, perhaps some texting and also to read/send my g-mail. Well 2 out of 3. The LG 840 uses some version of Java as an operating system. From reading, this was compatible with g-mail until August of 2013. It no longer is totally compatible. I am able to SEND mail through my g-mail account but not RECEIVE. From the LG840 blogs, this appears to now be universal. If I go to the built-in ""browser"" (in itself an UNBELIEVABLY TERRIBLE piece of software), I can eventually get to g-mail on the net and log-in. THE e-mail APP BUILT INTO THE PHONE APPEARS TO NO LONGER PROPERLY ACCESS GMAIL. So, 5 stars as a phone, 5 stars for a sharp-bright screen, - (minus) 5 stars as a browser and zero stars for the e-mail app.Would I buy this one again? NO. I bought it because the ZTE phone (Android) offered by Tracfone had such a bad screen. Let the buyer beware.If some computer geek knows how to make the LG 840 work receiving g-mail, please comment.

It is an excellent upgrade, and I am still getting used to it. However, I have had a lot of difficulty getting the 1200 minutes/triple for life added on. I've had to call customer service twice -- from a separate land line, by the way. The customer service number they provide on the website and in the emails connected me to Verizon, who eventually connected me to Tracfone. So, after several hours online, and two calls to customer service, I think I am finally set.As for the phone's features, I like that I finally have a qwerty keypad to use for texting, although it is very sensitive and results in an inordinate number of typos. Unfortunately, when you are entering new contacts, you have to do it using a phone keypad, not the qwerty keypad, so you are right back to where you were with the old clamshell design.The functions are similar to the old clamshell, so this is an easy transition to make. I don't think I will be using my valuable minutes to surf the internet or connect to facebook, by any means, but I will enjoy the easier texting capability this phone provides.Finally, beware the shipping costs for this item: I paid nearly $25 in shipping for a $100 phone! The only options were 2-3 day priority or overnight, so you're paying through the nose. Not only that, but I ordered the phone last Saturday, and this Saturday I see it listed for $27.99.

Moving minutes and days of service was done with no issues at all. That was fortunate as I have read of others having real problems getting it done.

Since then there have been some developments that I feel you need to know about. Before I purchased this phone,I made a call to customer service at tracfone and I was told that if I used the wifi feature that my phone would not be charged for minutes. Today, I hooked up the wifi and attempted to send some pics to my email addy. The pics would not go through, but the phone was charged several minutes for the attempts. Eventually I was forced to call customer service to get to the root of the problem, as the pics would not go through. I ended up having to phone the company three times before I reached a tec person who understood the problem and was able to correct it. The first time I called, while following the instructions of the customer service rep, my phone was charged for just over fourteen minutes. The customer service rep at first flat out refused to replace those minutes, or the forty minutes that were eaten while I was trying to get it to work as instructed by their booklet to begin with. Instead she offered me 10 min. and claimed it was company policy not to replace more than ten minutes ever.( this was proven to be the second lie I was told by a customer service rep) Eventually, after the third call to get this problem corrected, the gentleman who was speaking with my son, (by then I had taken myself out of the equation as I was understandably a screaming mimi by then, lol) apologized to my son for the fact that I had been lied to, and he also replaced all of the minutes I had been charged.He was also able to finally correct the problem I was experiencing. I appreciate the fact that this man owned the fact that the company spokesperson had lied to me to begin with. How ever, that never should have been an issue. I do not believe that she told me this lie because she was inexperienced, as I had requested a manager when I called. So I know she knew what she was saying. It seems that if you want to use the wifi to send pics for free, you must first log into your email carrier account, and then send the picture that way. (I haven't tried this yet, so I am still not sure if it will avoid being charged for sending the pictures in this manner, but the gentleman gave my son the impression that this would be the best way to do it.) If you send pics through the messaging option, you will be charged, and depending on the size of the attachment, it could be a very hefty fee, All in all, I am satisfied with the phone, but I must say that when it took 3 calls to get an honest person on the line, and when it takes 3 calls to get a problem addressed properly, well that doesn't reflect well on the technical help at all.The fact that I was lied to in my first contact with the company does not reflect well on them either. I do have to admit however, that despite the problems encountered today, I still am happy I purchased this model, and I am happy with the phone. Just beware of customer service, and make it clear to whomever you speak with, if you have to call, that you want ALL of your minutes back when they are through walking you through the problems encountered. I would make sure you get that promise up front before allowing them to blow through your minutes while they make mistake after mistake on your behalf. Technical support really left a bad taste in my mouth, but that having been said, I do like the phone.Merry Christmas everyone, and good luck with your purchase. (By the way, these problems should in no way reflect upon Amazon, they had nothing to do with the problems I encountered with the tracfone company spokespersons.)","December 6, 2013",

mobile phone,My LG 840G tracfone,Jean Braun,R1OKXKA4HHDZKX,3,"I am somewhat disappointed with this LG 840G tracfone. No instructions came with the phone, so I had to look it up on the internet to get an idea how to put my contacts in. The phone only comes with just a few ringtones, which are not my idea of having my phone sound like a phone. I have to have it in the same room with me to be able to hear the ring. Also, when I turn my phone on to unlock it to use, I have a very hard time of getting the screen to scroll up to open to use. I also wish I could get it to stay on longer than 30 seconds. On the upside, I like the sound of the voices on the phone when talking as it's easy to understand and nice and clear, but I miss my old phone, but it became outdated and quit working. I would not purchase this phone again.","March 20, 2013",

mobile phone,Okay phone but not easy in the hands.,80sGuy,R1T9LF7PR040HC,3,"The phone itself is very light, thin and somewhat stylish but I find it a bit difficult to handle while trying to work with one hand (scrolling/selecting name from contact list, dialing, etc.) due to its larger, wider size. But all this comes with the reward of a larger screen and this is ideal for people who are constantly utilizing the phone for internet data instead of the more casual uses such as voice calling and texting. Calls made are crystal clear from both ends, but of course that all depends on the reception. I use T-Mobile's 'Wifi Calling' (a must) since I get ZERO bars inside my home and it helps a great deal! The L9 has a huge 80s-style dial pad which feels good to the touch. You can also set it to touch vibrate along with a sounding tone. In fact the whole device kind of reminisces the 80s with its sharp features and rectangular shaped body except for all the extra high tech internet stuff. There are however a few major drawbacks on this phone; one of which is lacking an ambient sensor for the screen display. This means that you'll have to manually set the screen brightness to 'high' when used outdoors, and lower it back down during evenings -- unless you're okay with extreme brightness glowing in dark environments. The other small nuisance would be the 'Home' button -- where it requires a physical push. It's not a big deal but definitely not something you'd expect after getting used to all the soft touches. Despite some minor negatives, the L9 does come packed with a beefy Li-ion cell rated at 2150mAh and for this; battery life is excellent even with Wifi turned on all day. Here's the breakdown of some of the features I personally find either a plus or minus:Camera (5MP): not the easiest to use and not the greatest.Video Camera: great 1920x1080 HD videos!Speaker: adequate for casual conversation and news videos, but not for music playback.Internal storage: only 2Gb left after bloatware and software installation. I bought a 4GB MicroSD to store photos.Screen: nice and big for videos but hard to view in bright daylight, and lacking ambient sensor control.Battery: plenty at 2150mAh!Bluetooth: slow to recognize device and does not initiate automatically.Overall, the phone isn't bad if you can find a nice place to hold it, in my case it would be in my rear jean pocket (NOT the best place). Like I mentioned, it is quite some work when trying to initiate a call with one hand while driving because the phone does not provide a good 'grip'.","February 21, 2013",
mobile phone,LG Optimus,mark,R1SOD0QQXN0I8X,3,"I purchased the LG phone after a long debate and reading a lot of reviews. I am a very frugal guy and i have been on t-mobiles prepaid line for about a year. After the year, i decided to ""upgrade"" on the prepaid system. I purchased the optimus LG because it was available inthe prepaid plan. I am so glad i made the decision to purchase. There is great functionality with the phone. It has voice commands, nice screen, and great apps. The phone was fairly priced and i didnt go in the expectations of a newer phone that is offered on the line of a contract. Having a smart phone on a 4G network with the prepaid plan is still the best decision one can make. If you are one that use a phone to primarily make calls, text and browse on occasion, this phone is for you. I am also glad that i can use my home wireless or free wifi to not use up my data that comes with prepaid. If you are one that is attached to your phone and have to keep up with the latest phones and gadgets, then i suggest you get on a plan and pay for that luxury.","May 11, 2013",
mobile phone,A Smart Phone with a Smart Price Tag!,Looking California,R2C3K89LIAHB5M,3,"At less than $200, this LG was a bargain. I was actually considering spending over $500 on a Samsung Galaxy but I quickly came to my senses when I remembered that my kid will need college money one day. So here are the PROS: Excellent call quality, easy to navigate through menus, large screen, quick and responsive processing, has expandable memory, camera is decent and offers voice shutter response and panoramic shots, has a QuickMemo app built in which is where you can draw notes on a pad or on the screen, has a physical home button, and has a rubberized back cover which helps protect the phone. Here are the CONS: Comes with bloat ware installed, the battery doesn't seem to last very long (but it could be the apps I'm running), MP3 player has just so-so sound quality, the ""answer call"" swipe thingy can be stubborn when the phone is locked and I've actually missed calls while trying to swipe ""answer call"" over and over, the dialpad will frequently go black when on a call so that I can't input numbers, the power button is very small and I have to press it very hard to get it to engage. The worst thing about this phone for me is that it is so full of preloaded apps, hardly any new ones can be downloaded. There just isn't enough memory. The expandale SD card only works for photos, videos, and music it seems; not for apps. This is a bummer.Overall, I'm still happy with this phone and would buy LG again but only if I'm able to download more apps.","October 6, 2013",

mobile phone,"Slow Internet, Loses Connection, Poor Touchscreen, No Jellybean Update",Phil,R2BDPXZB7LRTW9,3,"Other than that, it's all good.I recently switched from US Cellular, because they left the Chicago market, and the company they sold to, is one I vowed never to use again.Before the switch, I was on a CDMA network, with 3G service, on a Motorola Defy XT. Single processor, Android 2.3. Waterproof, Gorilla Glass, solid reception, even in buildings.I picked up the LG Optimus L9, T-Mobile version, because of the Gorilla Glass, dual processors, processor speed, call quality reviews, external SD memory, removable battery, and the planned update to Jellybean. For me, this is a business tool, to make money. I need a solid, dependable, fast internet connection, great call quality, and the device has to play nice with my bluetooth headsets, and be able to run basic business apps.Well, the phone call quality is normally pretty good, as long as T-Mobile's reception holds up. It does drop calls occasionally, even when signal strength is full.The internet is noticeably slower than on my old 3G phone. That is a huge shock.As other reviewers have noted, sometimes the screen is unresponsive, and I have to zoom and/or reposition the screen image. Usually, I just have to tap the screen several times, but it happens frequently, and is annoying.Often, there are problems when I try to do manual edits onscreen; the touches don't register correctly, and the editor function doesn't work properly at all.I don't game, don't have a ton of apps. The thing came with some bloatware installed, some LG, some T-Mobile. I disabled as much of it as possible, but it can't be uninstalled or moved to the SD card, and wastes a lot of memory space.Some odd glitches pop up regularly. For one, even though I've disabled location services, and keep the GPS off, a couple times/week, I find the GPS running, and have to manually shut it down, and reset the default. I used to think it was a lock screen issue - random inputs while in pocket, but that's not the case.I lose internet connectivity fairly often, and T-Mobile customer service has been very good about it, but there's a pattern of system settings changing intermittently, without any help from me.T-Mobile has advised me to re-boot the phone once a day, to keep it from losing internet connections. I do this, but still lose my internet connection daily. Sometimes I have to re-boot the phone, sometimes I just have to wait 10 or 15 minutes. When the problem persists, I call T-Mobile, and they trace down the settings, or reset the data connection remotely, and have me re-boot the phone, to complete the process.The Jellybean update apparently damaged phones, so it was halted, and I have yet to see it available, since I purchased my L9. Looks like Jellybean isn't coming to the L9. The phone's memory is far less than the 32GB memory card I purchased, and I'm not pleased about that. The Jellybean update was to allow the L9 to move apps to the card, among other improvements.The battery life seems less than middle-of-the-road to me, which really kind of sucks, for a product like this, released in late 2012.Don't get me wrong, these disappointments don't mean spending $ 400.00 to $ 1000.00 on such a device makes any more sense, it doesn't. There's a fool born every minute, and unfortunately, the cell phone makers are able to charge obscene prices, because well, we don't demand better.Yeah, it's a $ 200.00 phone. It should work like a charm.","July 7, 2013",

It does run Jelly bean with lg's software written on top of it, which isn't the best, so I just got widget locker and action launcher and called it good. But one major thing is wrong. It only has about 2 gb of usable internal storage. But you can just use an sd card, right? Wrong! They have removed the move apps to sd card feature and I have rooted my phone hoping to find a solution only to find none, so rooted or not you barely get 2gb of storage.

I don't think I'd like to have a screen any bigger then that for everyday use. It's light weight and small...garnering compliments from those think it's one of the latest hot models.

mobile phone,All Z10 STL100-3 phones are NOT the same!,"Tech Papa ""Rob""",R3GL9CKVOTV8PO,3,"Blackberry makes variations of the STL100-3 Z10. This vendor is selling the Verizon version (RFF91LW). None of the Verizon phones are considered 'Factory Unlocked', since they are locked to Verizon by Blackberry at the time of manufacture. Therefore, any RFF91LW that is unlocked cannot accurately be claimed to be 'Factory Unlocked'. It would have to be unlocked by a 3rd Party. Next, and perhaps most important, the Verizon version is the 'Tri-band' RFF91LW and does not include the HSPA (UMTS 4 band) 1700 frequency, like its 'Quad-band' counterpart the RFK121LW. The only performance distinction between these models is that if you use the RFF91LW on T-Mobile in a non-4G LTE area, you will be unable to achieve 3G performance and the phone will drop to 2G performance levels. If the phone is used in a T-mobile 4G LTE service area, there would be no performance difference at all (in the U.S.; performance on some Canadian carriers may vary). When you order a Z10 directly from Blackberry, they offer only the RFK121LW and is available for about the same price from a variety of sources.

During these hours, I didn't listen music or watch videos but read news online, surfed internet, and made 2 short phone calls.3- When I turn it on, it takes about 50 seconds before I can use it.4- Its camera needs a lot of works.

mobile phone,I was a 5+ years iPhone User,"Gc ""iPoker""",RH32XUFVRU7DQ,3,"Long story short, I been an iPhone user since the 1st generation, before there was an App Store, before any carrier except ATT had it. Fast forward to iPhone 5. I've been skipping a lot of Android phone because I didn't think they were up to the standard of what a Smartphone should be. Android Apps used to be ugly, buggy, laggy, and their Apps store was limited. I'm glad to say that this is a thing of the past. This HTC One is my first Android phone that will replace my iPhone 5. After spending a crap load of time with the HTC One, here is my comparison:What I can do on the iPhone that I can also do on the HTC One:-Watch full length HD movies without crashing-Notes, documents, and to-do list can continuously sync to Google-HTC One aluminum body is as good as the iPhone 5'sWhat I can do on the iPhone 5 that I can NOT do on the HTC One (also cons for this phone):-I can easily use the iPhone with one hand-HTC One battery only last about 3/4 as long as the iPhone-iPhone will generally charge faster with the same charger-iPhone physical home button is very useful for turn the phone on, not found on HTC-iWork Apps and iCloud is better than Google Drive and the other Android alternatives-iMovie editing is still the best-iOS have builtin pdf, image, docx, doc, excel, and other format readerWhat I can do on the HTC One that I can NOT do on the iPhone:-Swipe keyboards are faster and surprisingly accurate-Emulators-Files transfer and organize like a real computer-Virus protection is built into the OS-Launcher means you can always change the UI if you get bored-True multi-tasking-Torrent downloads-Network file transfer and streaming is just like a real computer-You have the option to install any App-Micro-USB are better or equal in quality than lighting connector at a cheaper price-Android Apps are generally more capable-No more iTunes or any management software needed.IMO, these are the main features that are worth switching over to Android. Many of the features on the HTC one or Androids in general are not gimmicky features, but they are actually very useful. I waited for iOS 7 and the 5S before getting the HTC one. Considering that Apple is still selling the iPad 2, we will not see any Apps that will take advantage of the 5S hardware for a very long time. Also, iOS 7 is basically a cosmetic upgrade rather than a major feature upgrade. Frankly, jelly bean is miles ahead of iOS at this point. A few UI and animation tweaks, and adding a quick menu in iOS 7 isn't going to make much differences. I thought that after all these years Apple would put less restrictions on the iPhone Apps, use regular Micro-USB, or add a SD slot, but they have failed to do these simple things and it's really their fault if everyone starts switching to other phones.As for the other Android phones, it was tough choosing between the HTC One, S4, and Nexus 5. To break it down:S4: 3+ hours longer battery life, with replaceable battery, SD cardNexus 5: Newer Snapdragon 800 CPUHTC One: Built quality, really good speakersI pick the HTC One, because I have a place to charge my phone at least for 2-3 hours midday. The aluminum design was nice and sturdy. The bassy speakers is an experience in of itself. Also 32GB is enough for installing 3-4 larges games with 5-6 movies too, along with many small apps, pictures, documents, etc.To get an idea of the battery life, my HTC One battery went from 100% to 10% in 4-5 hours. I spent 40mins watching video, 30mins mp3, 2 hours internet radio, 2 hours torrent downloading, 1 hour converting videos, 1 hour web browsing, and some texting and YouTube in between. Most are done at the same time. I'm sure that all the cores were running since the phone felt warm, but no slow down at all. I consider this heavy usage. A 2A charger or the stock charger can add 60% battery in 1.5 hours.Cons:-Battery is okay, but I wish it lasted longer and charge faster since it's not replaceable-no sdcard-bad button placement, and the only power button is to short. I also tend to hit the volume button when I try to turn the phone on. It also depends on the case you use.-Phone gets warm-Low resolution camera, bad for zooming. Also depth of field problem at close shots which causes blurriness.It's been another week+ prior to that review above. It's safe to say that the switch was without regret. Both iPhone and HTC One are totally different phones. The iPhone exclusive features seems insignificant at this point. I'll be frank, the HTC One with Jelly Bean completely destroys it in nearly every category. Swiftkeys keyboard works great. Next launcher 3D looks amazing on the phone. Chrome can handle any webpage at fast speed. Apps and games load fast. The Playstation emulator works perfectly with enough power to even speed the games up. The speakers are very bassy, loud, clear, and no cracking at high volume. The sound are especially amazing with emulators and games. Makes me glad to choose this over the other Android phones. Apps are not buggy anymore, compared to older Android phones. No more syncing with iTunes, all my files are directly dragged in from my network folders using the phone. Apps that I've had on the iPhone are replaced on the Android that are far more powerful such as Sleep Cycle -> Sleep as Android, Video -> MX Player, Music -> DFX Player, Maps -> Google Maps, Note -> Google Keep, and Weather notification -> Weather widgets. I hope HTC continues to develop this phone, I think it's the best Android phone you can get right now.EDIT: I am downgrading this to 3 stars due to Kitkat version 4.4 update. The call voice keeps dropping and there is no way to use my otg cable anymore to access my flash drive. Other than that, I don't see any improvement from Kitkat, seems to just made the phone worst. I will probably switch off HTC brand for my next phone.","November 13, 2013",
mobile phone,A great attempt by HTC - but it needs work,Genryu,R2XYQPGHYJDV21,3,"I began following the HTC since it was first getting leaked that HTC was staging a comeback, and the HTC One was going to be their flagship device. I'm someone that always likes to jump on board with the latest and greatest and so I tried out the HTC One shortly after it came out. Despite my initial excitement and some positive aspects to the device and the software, I ultimately ended up returning it. I've tried to highlight the pros and cons below that led to my decision.Pros- Fantastic build quality: This is what an Android phone should be built like and it just feels fantastic to the touch. High quality materials all around - save for a few bands of plastic for the cellular and Wifi radios. Holding this in 1 hand and the SGS4 in the other makes it readily apparent which company went the extra mile to build something that feels solid in the hand.- Excellent screen: The color reproduction is by far the more accurate out of the recent crop of android devices on the market. I regularly use a color-calibration device on my computer monitors, so I pay particular attention to this. The unit I specifically got has a slight red-shift, but nothing that impairs the overall quality. It's definitely got more accurate color reproduction than the Samsung Galaxy S4, but some people might like the ""richer"" more saturated look that the SGS4 provides. Viewing angles are only about okay, but not a big issue for me since I'm the only one that uses this. The 1080p Resolution makes everything crisp and easy to read.- Above-average low-light performance: This phone overall does a better job than most other competitors in terms of low-light performance. I wish I could say it stands above the rest, but Nokia takes top honors in low-light and in terms of mixed lighting scenarios I still think the SGS4 is still a step up. See the cons for more information.- Good camera software: The Zoes feature is pretty cool and is a great way to create little clips or pick out the best image of the lot. It's easy to share and integrates well with existing social networks. It's one of the unique software features HTC offers, and is definitely one of the fun highlights that most people I show really enjoy playing with. I just wish it came with a dedicated camera button to make taking pictures a bit easier.- Great built-in speakers: The speakers that are built into the phone sound pretty solid if you're holding the phone in the standard portrait mode. It's great for sharing something with a friend when you're in a more public area and most phone speakers give out. Don't expect miracles from phone speakers, but as far as phone speakers go they are a step above the rest. The beats software also does some great synthesizer work when you plug in your headphones, though it's more suitable for current pop and hip-hop music than for other genres.- Blinkfeed: Blinkfeed sort of integrates all of the news you care about into one convenient sliding panel. I tried it for a bit, and while it's convenient I also feel it was reducing my battery performance (no evidence of this), so I simply chose to ignore it. It's a great option for those of you that want to pull in information from all of your favorite sites into one area. I don't think there is a way to remove blinkfeed entirely, you can only choose to ignore it like I did. Still work trying out though!- Includes IR integration: This means the HTC can connect and control your TV, which is pretty handy when you can't find the remote. It's pretty basic in terms of the controls you get, but it works well in a pinch.- Solid wifi performance: I have a Asus AC-1750 802.11ac router and tested speeds on file transfers and media playback with the HTC One and it came through with flying colors. I was easily able to transfer a 1080p MKV movie file of around a few gigs in size in minute or 2. It's not as quick as the external 802.11ac adapters I have, but excellent for a phone.Cons- The metal build of this phone means that if it gets dropped it will definitely show some serious battle-scars, paint chipping, and dents. The SGS4, though plastic, does have durability going for it. It's a shame to feel like you have to invest in a case since it's such a good looking device, but I just don't feel safe about using this phone outside without one because it's so easy for someone to bump you accidentally and for this phone to get thrashed. The metal also means this thing heats up quite a bit when you're doing things like watching movies/tv or playing a game.- Camera is just not that great overall: The camera integrates what HTC is calling ultra-pixels, which are basically a smaller number of bigger pixels to capture more light. While this is a fine solution to capture more light and give you better low-light performance, it's not the best choice for when you do have plenty of light or even moderate light. Frankly, I just didn't think the images were that great, and the lack of zoom while working with them on your desktop becomes readily apparent - especially if you like to crop your shots after taking them like I do. I personally think Nokia's implementation of using a ridiculously large megapixel sensor and combining multiple pixels to oversample is the better solution. Take a look at the new Nokia 1020 sample images and compare to see for yourself. If I had to buy a Android phone today and wanted the best overall camera - my nod goes to the SGS4.- Average battery life: While the capacity seems decent for a phone, because of the higher resolution and larger screen I've been seeing very average to poor battery life results. I've used it mainly on my daily commute, which involves listening to Pandora to and from work, checking gmail very regularly throughout the day, and using the calendar and GPS functions frequently. I do watch a tv show during the afternoon sometimes if I'm on the go, and make about a hour or 2 worth of phone calls a day. Put simply, I've bought a external battery pack and a spare charger with me everyday that I had this phone because if I wanted to go out after work I could not trust the HTC One to make it through. Every HTC device I've tried has had middling battery life, from the HTC Sensation to the HTC One X. It seems HTC hasn't changed much here, and it's a shame because the battery is sealed in, so I'm not at all confident about battery degradation over time.- No expandable storage: The 32gb that's built into this phone, with a fair amount used up for the HTC software, just isn't enough for power users. I load on a good deal of my own music and I used to just swap out movies and tv shows onto a microSD card slot to take on the go (thanks to data caps ruining the fun of streaming them on the go). I think 32gb will be fine for most people, but not having the option to expand like the SGS4 or Sony models just puts HTC one step below.- Still some lag: This phone has some really fast internals, and does indeed run very smoothly most of the time. Unfortunately, there are still those moments of slow-down and lag that have plagued Android handsets for a while that I at least still notice. This isn't going to be a 100% smooth experience, but it's not enough to severely impact the daily use of this phone. Just wanted to mention that it still is there for those of you that care.- Poor button placement: The power button is along the top part of the phone because it's integrated with the IR blaster, meaning it can be pretty hard to reach for those with smaller hands. Moreover, HTC decided to break the Android standard and include only the back and home button with a big non-functional htc logo in the middle. I can't tell you how many times I've pushed the logo expecting to go home, and this is something my friends have done too when playing with the phone. It's just a poor design decision.Ultimately for me the most important aspects of a phone are camera performance, screen quality, and battery life. In terms of camera-performance the HTC One is just not as good as the competition, and I cannot recommend buying it for the ultra-pixel (4MP) camera when there are better options available today and coming out soon. Screen quality on this phone is probably the best you can get in nearly all regards. And the battery-life is just something that on day-1 isn't good enough for me on what I consider moderate usage. Overall, if I had to own this phone for a few years, I wouldn't feel too happy about it. While the screen quality will hold up over time, the camera performance is already behind the competition and the battery life will only get worse as the battery degrades over time. I'm glad HTC is staging a comeback and this is a great first-step, but it's still got some work to do before I can recommend their devices for long-term ownership and satisfaction.","July 25, 2013",

mobile phone,If you have any interest in taking photos don't buy an HTC One,Jim,RMTVVLDLLBGIY,3,"Basically there are two good things about this phone. The battery life is good and the screen is excellent. However, if you have the slightest interest in taking photos of a quality higher then crap, don't buy this phone. It has the worst cell phone camera of any modern smartphone in the past decade. Their ultrapixel claims are nonsense. Yes, each one captures more light BUT THERE ARE LESS OF THEM. So the overall amount of light captured isn't much different than a 13 mpixel phone. And nothing can make up for the complete lack of detail in the photos due to the abysmal 5 Mpixeal sensor. I replaced my HTC Rezound, which had an 8 Mpixel camera with this dud and wish I had not fallen for the ultrapixel nonsense. This HTC Ones photos aren't even half as nice as what I could take with the Rezound. Sure, they look fine on the phone screen but look at them on your computer screen and they are just fuzzy as all heck. Even on the phone screen, as soon as you zoom in on them you see the terrible resolution. In closing, if you have the slightest interest in the quality of the photos' you take, run away from this phone.","May 16, 2014",

If you want to play music/ gaming/ GPS on it, how the power run away is just like spilling water even with the ""power saver"" on, you just can't believe how it drains itself from 100% to 30 or 40% in 3 hours. So in order to keep your phone alive for a whole day, an external battery pack will be a must.*And even if you have the external battery pack, be sure to use a better quality cable in order to successfully charge, otherwise, there will be a ""friendly reminder"" that recommends you to use the OEM cable/ charger, or worse, it will be losing power.*Very Important*Do consider to buy a protection plan if yours do not have one. As you can see that the phone is ""Crafted with a distinct zero-gap aluminum unibody"", it means there is NO WAY for you nor any private phone store can fix it for you unless you take it back to HTC since they are using a special glue to stick the screen and the base together, and normally, if you have a protection plan, they will just replace a whole new phone to you instead of fixing it for you (True story- My brother's experience).**Also, need to read carefully what the protection plan covers: water damage,Screen scratches...etc.","March 19, 2014",

I am unable to transfer information from my phone to my laptop using the USB port (the documented settings do not exist on my phone), Bluetooth does not work (tried on three different computers) - and again the documentation does not match the phone, and everything requires I run all of my data through some corporation like Google, which means I may as well put my data on a billboard across the street from the Blue Cube.Would it kill them to document their product each time they come out with a new model?Would it kill them to have you me able to stick the USB port into a best selling computer and have it see the photos and contact list?Why does everything have to go through some privacy killing site like Google or Facebook?","August 10, 2013",
mobile phone,Good...but not as good as iPhone,Michelle Hsu,RI5NJACH5NB53,3,"I've always been an iPhone user but when I had the chance to upgrade I decides to change things up and see how I would fare with a non iPhone smart phone. Meh.The good thing about this phone is that it has much superior graphics and pictures. The pictures that the camera can take are amazing. Millions of times better than the iPhone. Additionally the pixelation is much higher so watching videos and stuff is excellent on the phone. But that's about where all the good things end.The keyboard glitches. The sideways keyboard is much too large and the regular right side up keyboard is much too small. The dimensions of the phone are huge, so that makes it hard to fit into your pockets without having it poke out or be really uncomfortable. The phone itself is also pretty glitchy - a lot of apps aren't able to match the interface which results in a lot of app crashing. Also the phone has a problem with receiving internet which is super frustrating.So in summary, if you like to use your phone more as a tablet (watching movies, videos, taking pictures, reading articles, etc) then get it. But if you want a phone that you can actually use, try looking somewhere else.","April 13, 2014",
mobile phone,Awesome phone with some basic feature missing,Mr. A. Hawlader,R9JQ7FFQC59VT,3,"Awesome phone but have some limitations. Excellent build quality with super fast processing. Like the audio quality and the camera (Zoe) features. No complaint with non removal battery and no-SD slot at all. But after using 2 months, in my opinion it is missing some of the very basic features that should be included. Before this phone I was using a Nokia N8. So what I'm missing in this phone are: no inbuilt profile manager, file manager, not able to set increasing alarm sound, cant connect HTC sync manager using Bluetooth :(. I'm not a power user and I think these are very basic but mast have features for a flagship phone like HTC One. I cant give more that 3.5 star rating for this phone.","July 1, 2013",
mobile phone,Disappointed,Matt,R3FS6UK8XWG707,3,"After years of using just about every iPhone since the original, I decided it was time to give Android a try to see how it compares. I've had this phone for about 10 months now, so I feel like I've adjusted enough to provide a fair review.The first thing that puts me off about this phone is that Android lacks the elegance of iOS. I think that iOS provides a much better stock look and feel and overall user experience (even after nearly a year of using the HTC One). Additionally, and this may be specific to this model, but the phone seems very finicky and glitchy in comparison and this also seems to go for many of the apps. The most frustrating bug was when I installed a stock OS update and the phone ended up in a boot loop. I had to perform a factory reset and lost a lot of my recent photos and data that I hadn't backed up yet. A lot of the apps that are available for both Android and iOS seem to lag behind on new feature updates and lack the same attention to detail in the Android app market.The real killer though, is that unlocking the bootloader to flash new recovery and rom images voids your warranty. Why would I want to buy an Android if I can't unlock the bootloader? Customizability is one of Android's biggest selling points, and a locked bootloader really limits what you can do. I'll be unlocking it anyway, but the fact that it voids my warranty is super disappointing.I think that most people who are interested in this phone would be happier with an iPhone. More elegant and straight forward, better customer support, better apps, and more reliable. I'll probably have to give one of the Google devices a chance before I completely condemn Android, but I definitely won't be buying another HTC device in the foreseeable future.","May 8, 2014",

mobile phone,"High geek factor, low practicality","Konrad K. Miller ""Radman""",RG7QLKQ1BRMIU,3,"I wont bore you with long item by item comparisons.My requirement for a cell phone is 50% business 50% entertainment.Personally I am 20% g33k and 80% ""guy who needs to get stuff done"".With that out of the way, here are my impressions.There are a lot of very cool features on the galaxy like ""air"" features which allow control of the phone without actually touching it and ""Smart"" features which examine pictures of your face to determine if you are looking at the screen. However, these features function intermittintly at best, and even if they were rock solid, are of limited utility. I dont advise anyone to buy this phone based on these features.One ""feature"" that the phone boasts is how slim it is. This comes at the cost of an inadequate battery. I, personally would rather deal with a thicker phone and a solid 24 hour battery life than this tiny tank of a battery and power hyngry phone.Many would say that there are features that I should turn off to preserve battery life, and they are correct, however I don't belive that a person should have to allocete time to configure his or her phone characteristics to match the situation that they are in at that point in time; a situation that may change in hours or even minutes.Mulltimeda integration is a hodgpodge of high performance and low integration. You will not be able to plug the phone into USB host and play music, your phone will not be recognized as a valid data store. you will have to use bluetooth.Despite all this, I do get the functionality that I want out of the phone. The battery is easily changeable. Memory expansion is a breeze with micro SD. The screen is large, and the camera is sharp. My last phone was an iphone 4 and did not compare well in these regards. Even though it was superior in multimedia capability, intergration and operation, this S4 is a better overall fit for my day to day.Given a ""do-over"", I would have gotten the S3 as the ""cost to utility"" ratio is more favorable.","October 23, 2013",

mobile phone,...Meh...thats how i sum up the Galaxy S4,kingjaffi,R2OBDBODW6R4GG,3,"Update - December 22, 2013 - After 2 months of owning this S4 i honestly don't know how this phone has sold so well. I must repeat, for this price this phone is supposed to be silky smooth and buttery fast and flawless. Four days ago while at a house warming party i got to interact with my friends iphone 5, and OH MY GOODNESS, the phone is fast and smooth. There is absolutely no hesitation AT ALL. She was showing some photos of her dog and when she moved around the phone the various menu and photo galley the phone just move effortlessly. I was completely embarrassed as i tried to show her photos of my cat. As usual my S4 hesitated for about 3 seconds to bring up the galley not to mention to bring up the photo album. Literally that took about 5 seconds to load. Listen i don't mind waiting 5 seconds but i am not paying $600 for a phone to do that. It is a crying shame. I am actually thinking about factory resetting the phone to see if it will work better.Also my battery has started to swell malfunction when playing hi end games under 50% so i have have to purchase a new battery.For the money i am really disappointed.First Review - November 13, 2013 - I have been dreaming about this phone for months. I previously had an LG Optimus 4X and have been trying to sell it desperately to get this. Anyway i finally got it and trust me maybe because of all the hype i expected more. I thought that this phone would be as close to perfection as possible but it is far from it. The camera takes a long time to load up, the stock keyboard doesn't have auto prediction, flash light apps dont work properly cant create folders on the home screen by dragging one icon over the other and the overall phone is not as fast as i thought it would be. I dont know if its because it is the Exynos chipset or what but i'm not really impressed. And dont even get me started on the small on board storage for a 16GB version. Its just ridiculous. The Screen is mind blowingly awesome so videos and games POP. It runs the top games flawlessly but the above stuff has really gotten to me. I am told that the new firmware upgrade fixes a lot of those issues so i am waiting to see how that goes. For now its an ok phone.","November 13, 2013",

mobile phone,Honest Review,Jake Gadomski,R1SYJVH2NDFQ8,3,"First thing: good job Samsung. Second thing: great hardware, terrible software. If you're a fan of beautiful animations and a nice interface, the GS4 is not for you. Don't get me wrong, I love my S4, but it feels like something is missing. It's a phone you might not want to stick with during a full 2 year contract. The most used app you'll experience is the texting app. The text interface is like a luxury car without the luxury. It just gets you to point A and B. Things like the keyboard and sent text messages just pop out of thin air, no animation what so ever. I'm not an Apple fan but their text inteface for IOS 7 is stunning. It needs more of an Android feel to it all. Samsung's Touchwiz interface just sucks. Let me remind you that it's the same interface found on older Samsung devices. So it's not all an entirely new phone. I would like to see some changes with Touchwiz in the near future. It's too bland. Other than these few things, it's a great phone. Not ground breaking, but better than the S3.","October 9, 2013",

mobile phone,The phone delivery time was great but like the other reviews mentioned the seal on the box was tampered with and already open.,oBiG NaZtYo <-- GT,R2QCJ53XOMF961,3,"The phone came already opened as if the seller tampered with it before hand. Can't say they did tamper with it because the device seems great. But you can see that the seal was broken and open once before. The other reviews also mentioned that. Depends on the seller I guess. Secondly the phone says it's made in China but the writing on the box is in spanish making it to belive that the phone is from Mexico. I think the manufacturer open the box to change the language. It's in english but some of the apps are still in spanish like the samsung stock app to take a picture of text in different languages and recognize and translate. The phone is amazing and worth the buy. The only phone on this planet that compares to it is the note 3. I bought this a couple days before the note 3 unveiling. You can't go wrong with either product. The phone sits at 5 inches and I can reach all 4 corners of the screen with one hand effortlessly. I recomend a screen protector and I found the best one. I will add the name at the end of the review. The phone does come with a lot of bloatware samsung tied to the os. I recomend rooting and installing the stock rom from google to speed up the phone even though performance is not an issue. I just feel that even though things are good and fast, that it could be better. The camera is above par. Don't let Nokia's gimmick 40mp sensor lumias fool you. This camera is amazing. 20 shutter shots at 10 frames all at good quality close to 4k. The speakers are amazing. Surprised me on the depths of the sound and how they reached all 4 corners of the room from the palm of my hands. The softwared samsung put in this makes the device more valuable than the hardware itself. The ""Octacore"" cpu makes task and installing apps fast. The battery life is amazing. I sat for hours just getting all the apps and info linked to my account and sat above 80%. No problems with the phone heating up either in the time of usuage. The screen is nothing short of what you would expect from samsung. 1080p display is something everyone should have. The phone feels good in the hand. Light. I was a proud owner of the first galaxy and I think samsung made a great product in this. Since that first galaxy I purchased two phones. Artix 2 & Iphone 4. The only reason I purchased the Iphone was for Itunes and the Ipod app. As a long time android user adjusting to apple and their rules took some time. If you want a simple user experience this isn't the device for you. Get an iPhone. With the 5s being x64 bit it's pretty much laying down the foundation of forcing previous model users to upgrade because the knew phone does not support backwards compalibility with the apps. If you want a defined experience and something you can customize to cater to you and your needs this phone is for you. The versitility of this phone and all the software that comes with it make the device more useful.","September 13, 2013",

mobile phone,Lovely phone with lots of faults,Mixed Joy,R1V1YXR0SSMUBF,3,"Found it pretty frustrating and overall disappointing. the design of the screen is pretty good. the phone is over sensitive and its arguable if its better to have a case makes that worse or better. because of its sensitivity its very easy to switch on apps without you knowing. The placement of the POWER button is just stupid its right where your thumb goes (for rightys anyway). Getting Apps to stay off for apps you dont use is a nightmare even with the use of a 3rd party app killer so that can be a huge power suck. Samsung, AT&T; offer little to NO support so your best bet is to go to Youtube and that's a crapshoot. I was using an iphone 4 and what made me move was the better Exchange support since our office is Windows based it makes it easier to search old emails etc. And also I detest itunes with a passion and since i have a lot of music that's just amplified.So there is good - the video playback is pretty outstanding, sound quality is pretty good too. As a PHONE its actually really good compared to the iphone which is more iapp that can occasionally make and take calls and I do get thats partially to do with AT&T; service.Anyway my recommendation is if you are not a geek this is not your phone please move along. iPhone, Nokia Lumia or even the blackberry might be more your speed and mine apparently.","July 19, 2013",
mobile phone,Beware of battery/charging issues,Jackie2won,R12M1QBTLEMOWA,3,"I purchased an ATT Galaxy S4 two weeks ago and have had nothing but problems with the battery and the charging process. I have bought 7 different chargers but none of them, including the one that came in the box, will charge the phone completely. I connect the charger when I go to bed and 7 hours later the battery is weaker than when I began charging. The charger seems to go off and on during the night and it actually ends up discharging on most nights. This is a chronic issue with Samsung phones. No one has a definitive answer but they tell you to buy a new battery and try that. Others say it still doesn't work. The phone has more features than anyone could possibly use but what good are they if you can't get a decent charge on the battery and thus can't depend on your phone to work when you need it? I'm going back to iPhone. Really sorry to say this, but I fell for the hoopla over the Galaxy 4 and it is a complete dud as far as I'm concerned. Beware!","May 26, 2013",

mobile phone,A great attempt by HTC - but it needs work,Genryu,R3PUPS5LRZLF4Q,3,"I began following the HTC since it was first getting leaked that HTC was staging a comeback, and the HTC One was going to be their flagship device. I'm someone that always likes to jump on board with the latest and greatest and so I tried out the HTC One shortly after it came out. Despite my initial excitement and some positive aspects to the device and the software, I ultimately ended up returning it. I've tried to highlight the pros and cons below that led to my decision.Pros- Fantastic build quality: This is what an Android phone should be built like and it just feels fantastic to the touch. High quality materials all around - save for a few bands of plastic for the cellular and Wifi radios. Holding this in 1 hand and the SGS4 in the other makes it readily apparent which company went the extra mile to build something that feels solid in the hand.- Excellent screen: The color reproduction is by far the more accurate out of the recent crop of android devices on the market. I regularly use a color-calibration device on my computer monitors, so I pay particular attention to this. The unit I specifically got has a slight red-shift, but nothing that impairs the overall quality. It's definitely got more accurate color reproduction than the Samsung Galaxy S4, but some people might like the ""richer"" more saturated look that the SGS4 provides. Viewing angles are only about okay, but not a big issue for me since I'm the only one that uses this. The 1080p Resolution makes everything crisp and easy to read.- Above-average low-light performance: This phone overall does a better job than most other competitors in terms of low-light performance. I wish I could say it stands above the rest, but Nokia takes top honors in low-light and in terms of mixed lighting scenarios I still think the SGS4 is still a step up. See the cons for more information.- Good camera software: The Zoes feature is pretty cool and is a great way to create little clips or pick out the best image of the lot. It's easy to share and integrates well with existing social networks. It's one of the unique software features HTC offers, and is definitely one of the fun highlights that most people I show really enjoy playing with. I just wish it came with a dedicated camera button to make taking pictures a bit easier.- Great built-in speakers: The speakers that are built into the phone sound pretty solid if you're holding the phone in the standard portrait mode. It's great for sharing something with a friend when you're in a more public area and most phone speakers give out. Don't expect miracles from phone speakers, but as far as phone speakers go they are a step above the rest. The beats software also does some great synthesizer work when you plug in your headphones, though it's more suitable for current pop and hip-hop music than for other genres.- Blinkfeed: Blinkfeed sort of integrates all of the news you care about into one convenient sliding panel. I tried it for a bit, and while it's convenient I also feel it was reducing my battery performance (no evidence of this), so I simply chose to ignore it. It's a great option for those of you that want to pull in information from all of your favorite sites into one area. I don't think there is a way to remove blinkfeed entirely, you can only choose to ignore it like I did. Still work trying out though!- Includes IR integration: This means the HTC can connect and control your TV, which is pretty handy when you can't find the remote. It's pretty basic in terms of the controls you get, but it works well in a pinch.- Solid wifi performance: I have a Asus AC-1750 802.11ac router and tested speeds on file transfers and media playback with the HTC One and it came through with flying colors. I was easily able to transfer a 1080p MKV movie file of around a few gigs in size in minute or 2. It's not as quick as the external 802.11ac adapters I have, but excellent for a phone.Cons- The metal build of this phone means that if it gets dropped it will definitely show some serious battle-scars, paint chipping, and dents. The SGS4, though plastic, does have durability going for it. It's a shame to feel like you have to invest in a case since it's such a good looking device, but I just don't feel safe about using this phone outside without one because it's so easy for someone to bump you accidentally and for this phone to get thrashed. The metal also means this thing heats up quite a bit when you're doing things like watching movies/tv or playing a game.- Camera is just not that great overall: The camera integrates what HTC is calling ultra-pixels, which are basically a smaller number of bigger pixels to capture more light. While this is a fine solution to capture more light and give you better low-light performance, it's not the best choice for when you do have plenty of light or even moderate light. Frankly, I just didn't think the images were that great, and the lack of zoom while working with them on your desktop becomes readily apparent - especially if you like to crop your shots after taking them like I do. I personally think Nokia's implementation of using a ridiculously large megapixel sensor and combining multiple pixels to oversample is the better solution. Take a look at the new Nokia 1020 sample images and compare to see for yourself. If I had to buy a Android phone today and wanted the best overall camera - my nod goes to the SGS4.- Average battery life: While the capacity seems decent for a phone, because of the higher resolution and larger screen I've been seeing very average to poor battery life results. I've used it mainly on my daily commute, which involves listening to Pandora to and from work, checking gmail very regularly throughout the day, and using the calendar and GPS functions frequently. I do watch a tv show during the afternoon sometimes if I'm on the go, and make about a hour or 2 worth of phone calls a day. Put simply, I've bought a external battery pack and a spare charger with me everyday that I had this phone because if I wanted to go out after work I could not trust the HTC One to make it through. Every HTC device I've tried has had middling battery life, from the HTC Sensation to the HTC One X. It seems HTC hasn't changed much here, and it's a shame because the battery is sealed in, so I'm not at all confident about battery degradation over time.SPRINT VERSION: I did not purchase the sprint version when I got this phone, but I did get to play around with my friend's Sprint HTC One and he's had consistently slower LTE speeds and poorer battery life than I have when we checked our battery usage meters one day doing roughly the same things. This is because the Sprint CDMA network is less power-efficient than the GSM-based version I tried out, and also because we probably had different levels of LTE signal strength. It shouldn't be too big of a difference in practical use, but something to know.- No expandable storage: The 32gb that's built into this phone, with a fair amount used up for the HTC software, just isn't enough for power users. I load on a good deal of my own music and I used to just swap out movies and tv shows onto a microSD card slot to take on the go (thanks to data caps ruining the fun of streaming them on the go). I think 32gb will be fine for most people, but not having the option to expand like the SGS4 or Sony models just puts HTC one step below.- Still some lag: This phone has some really fast internals, and does indeed run very smoothly most of the time. Unfortunately, there are still those moments of slow-down and lag that have plagued Android handsets for a while that I at least still notice. This isn't going to be a 100% smooth experience, but it's not enough to severely impact the daily use of this phone. Just wanted to mention that it still is there for those of you that care.- Poor button placement: The power button is along the top part of the phone because it's integrated with the IR blaster, meaning it can be pretty hard to reach for those with smaller hands. Moreover, HTC decided to break the Android standard and include only the back and home button with a big non-functional htc logo in the middle. I can't tell you how many times I've pushed the logo expecting to go home, and this is something my friends have done too when playing with the phone. It's just a poor design decision.Ultimately for me the most important aspects of a phone are camera performance, screen quality, and battery life. In terms of camera-performance the HTC One is just not as good as the competition, and I cannot recommend buying it for the ultra-pixel (4MP) camera when there are better options available today and coming out soon. Screen quality on this phone is probably the best you can get in nearly all regards. And the battery-life is just something that on day-1 isn't good enough for me on what I consider moderate usage. Overall, if I had to own this phone for a few years, I wouldn't feel too happy about it. While the screen quality will hold up over time, the camera performance is already behind the competition and the battery life will only get worse as the battery degrades over time. I'm glad HTC is staging a comeback and this is a great first-step, but it's still got some work to do before I can recommend their devices for long-term ownership and satisfaction.","July 25, 2013",

mobile phone,"Nice hardware, bloated software",Marcus S Mitchell,R388QK4JM27Z8U,3,"After using an iPhone, I became subconsciously accustomed to the simplicity and attention to detail present in Apple products. While the HTC One is an incredible piece of hardware, the software drags an otherwise remarkable phone into the mediocre category.- Way too many set-up steps (sign-in/sign-up for Google account, register an HTC account, etc.)- Too big. I know phones are growing larger and larger every second, but I tend to like phones that are capable of being used with only one hand. Unless you have ""The Undertaker's"" hands, you'll constantly find yourself frustrated in your attempt to tap something on the opposite side of the phones screen.- Camera is good in low-light, but the low pixel density renders blurry pictures not unlike the camera of the Palm Pre- Inability to deactivate ""Blinkfeed"" is annoying.- Android software simply isn't as beautiful as iOS- Camera app is finicky. Weird focusing process.Overall, this is a gorgeous phone. And for Android users, you'd be right at home. But for those switching from iOS, you will be met with tons of frustration induced by the lack of simplicity present in the software.","July 5, 2013",

mobile phone,"Great little phone, but battery/phone died after 4 days",Dimsu,RXRJ553IBDHNQ,3,"I was able to fully use the handset for 4 days. I come from the Android platform and am an RF Engineer for 14 years working in wireless.The handset build quality is absolutely great for the price. The touch screen is great, the keyboard predictability also great. The way the phone handled day to day operation, for the price was also great. It is not a Lumia 9xx phone, it is an entry level Windows 8 phone. The camera is a basic camera, it did not take good pictures when my kid moved even slightly (there was blur). The screen in sunlight, is not as bright as I'd like. Once again, a great handset for the price. I confirmed wifi calling, it worked flawlessly. I had a major issue for the phone to allow me to create an outlook.com email address (needed to use their App store), it would not work and would return a hexadecimal error. To fix this, I reset the phone and tried again and it worked. (hahaha... a windows product that requires resets hmmm... but to be fair, Android and iOs has needed a reset so no points lost there)Now onto where we have an issue. The issue came about after 4 days of using it. I powered the phone off (it had about 80% battery charge). It turned off, I popped the cover off, and removed my SIM. I went back to my Android device to do some work stuff, and came back to the Lumia 521 about 3hrs later. The phone would not power up. I tried everything, if i plug it in (tried for about 17hr charge) it will not keep the charge. I tried to reset it (hold down volume down/power for 10s) did nothing. The screen is working, it shows a battery charging, but it won't hold the charge and won't power up. I will be returning it to the store, hopefully it is simply a defective battery.If you're looking for a good handset with all the functionality of a smart phone yes it is a great phone. I enjoyed the size and interface. Hopefully, the battery thing will be resolved today.Update - 5/29/13I was able to exchange the phone for another. So far no issues with the phone. There is one issue that was repeated on both phones and below is the description of the issue and its solution.During initial setup of email, I tried to sign-in to my outlook.com account. Login/password work on my PC. However, upon trying this on the phone it would fail. The error I'd receive is - ERROR 0X80048264. There is not much that would work, tried a soft reset, turning on/off etc it would not work. The solution is to perform a hard reset (go into settings, click About Phone and perform a reset). Once the phone restores, the login process worked.Please note, this is a T-Mobile store purchased phone. It is my opinion, that when you turn on the phone, an update takes place (takes a while) and I believe it downloads WiFi Calling update. Upon this being downloaded, it creates the scenario where the process of login for your Outlook or Live or Hotmail account doesn't go thru. By doing a hard reset, the update for wifi calling remains but the phone's other settings reset. Hopefully, this is a patch/update issue that will soon get resolved.Please feel free to respond if your process is successful to help others. I still like the handset and enjoy using it.","May 28, 2013",
mobile phone,Some tips and problem with upload music,Jimbo,R1ELG7ZD4Z1O8H,3,"For a little over $100, this is really a full featured smart phone. Windows Phone OS is really innovative and fun if you are tired of Android and Apple iOS. Overall, I concur with other reviewers that this is an amazing value proposition that leaves only a little to be desired. The only thing I really wish is for a front facing camera and brighter/bolder screen. Here's some things you may not know.1) The Nokia Here Drive/Map apps give you free download of maps so you can do GPS turn by turn directions without using a data plan. These apps are very good and will get you from point A to point B accurately. The GPS on this phone also locks onto satellites very quickly.2) This comes with WIFI calling app that you can setup to use with your wifi connection. If you have bad reception in your home or office, activating wifi calling will give you perfect reception to get/make calls (assuming your wifi/internet connection is good). Setting up WIFI calling though is rather a chore in patience. Note that your minutes used with WIFI are counted against your plan.3) Downloading skydrive app will allow you to sync your photos/docs/videos for free on your Microsoft SkyDrive account automatically. Up to 7GB free storage when you sign up. Skydrive is good for sharing photos with friends or between phones.4) The phone can play mp4 and avi videos but is finicky. Some videos will not play due to encoding variations. However, you can download the free Windows/Mac Desktop HandBrake application to re-encode your videos that will play very smoothly on your phone.5) You can hold down the ""back"" button and see all the apps running in the background. Hold down the ""windows"" button and make a voice command.6) You can pin a lot of items as a main screen tile. Items like contacts and single website pages can be pinned.7) You plug the phone into your PC using the usb cable and it will show up as a drive in your computer (with subfolders) where you can copy your media. You can also download the official Windows Phone application from Microsoft to sync your photos, music, and videos.After a few weeks of using this--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Still really like the phone. I had to drop it down from 4 stars to 3. HOWEVER, uploading music after installing SD card is MADNESS! I have a lot of music, so I installed a 32gb San Disk. I used the Window Phone software to sync my music and every song has a double entry. If you try to resync again, you will get quadruple entries. THere's no solution for this. I tried everything I can think of! You can read the Microsoft support forums and nobody know show to fix this problem and Microsoft just ignores it. And reading the card is PAINFULLY SLOW. I used the same 32GB Sandisk car in WIndows phone 7.5 and it ran beautifully, never having any problems. If you have music to upload using an SD card, I suggest you skip Windows Phone. The fact that they haven't fixed this for so long boggles my mind. It's a huge complaint when using SD cards in Windows Phone.","September 4, 2013",
mobile phone,Nokia Lumia 521,OMD,R2ORAYN7YT419J,3,"I have had this product for about 5 months now. There has been a lot of positives about this phone and negatives. First I will start off with the positives. I am not an expert with technology but this phone was great for getting started. It is easy to use and a great way to get a taste of Windows 8. I love that I am able to share stuff from my phone to my computer with the skydrive. It also is very nice for customizing. You can chose the color scheme and design the pins to fit your needs. The battery life is also really nice on this phone. I charge my phone usually every other day. Now for the negatives though. One issue I have had the past few weeks is the phone turning on and off. It seems if I move it in anyway or don't set it down careful it turns off. There has been two occasions in the past two weeks were it shuts off and doesn't turn on for about four hours. I read a lot of reviews online and it seems a lot of people have had that issue. It seems the battery does not fit into the slot right. Another negative is the Microsoft store. It is very underdeveloped. A lot of apps that are on the android market, and apple store are not available for Microsoft phones. If these two problem didn't exist i would give the phone a lot higher of a score.","May 14, 2014",
mobile phone,T-mobile service,busybee,R20WXJ0UBJ2MBH,3,"The customer service was amazing with T-Mobile and it was also fulfilled by Amazon so double thumbs up!The phone itself though is okay - not excellent. I switched from my blackberry to this and I have to say, personally, I love the QWERTY keyboard better than the touchscreen on this phone. But that's just my opinion. It has some very neat gadgets like the installed Microsoft apps and it's super easy to use. I think this phone is a great choice for the older generation who wants a sleek and up to date phone but doesn't want the hassle of all the updates.","February 27, 2014",

mobile phone,Decent starter smart phone (but quirks),"Gregory A. Henry ""atlantagreg""",R11Y2HVP1PRWAX,3,"I'll just do a short Pro and Con list here as someone else has done, but overall I'll say first that this would be a good choice as a first smart phone for teens, people who don't want a complex super-feature phone, or older folks looking for something easy to use that won't break the bank like an iPhone.Pro List:1) Solid build overall - feels solid for the price.2) If you're in a good reception zone, good call quality.3) Win 8 OS is fairly easy to figure out, and online tutorials are easy to find.4) Major apps available for Win 8 OS now, secondary apps (eventually).5) Rear camera takes *decent* photos (but no flash).6) Slightly above average battery life.7) Affordable, and a good value for this price range overall.8) Screen/phone good size for ""pocketability"" - not too huge.Con List:1) The power/standby button is VERY poorly placed about halfway down the right side of the phone - where you want to grip it, causing fairly frequent accidental pushes and therefore causing you to have to push the button again to come back out of standby mode.2) No front facing camera (sorry, no Skype video calls).3) Dedicated camera button on phone does not work (Dead on my phone - not sure how common this is). As a workaround, you can touch the screen to focus and snap the shot but it's more awkward and time consuming than the button would have been.I won't comment about the T-Mobile service in a con way though some complain about it. They do have less coverage than the other major carriers but are supposedly bolstering it with new towers all of the time. In my particular area of metro Atlanta we can get very strong signals from Verizon, AT&T; and most of the time from Sprint. T-Mobile's signal can be ""iffy"" and indoors I find it slipping back into a 2G speed mode. This is not the fault of the phone, hence again, why it's not on the con list. Just be aware that T-Mobile service can be excellent in some areas, but somewhat poor in areas where the others are still good. Test the phone reception thoroughly when you get it in your area, home, out and about, etc.If half stars were available I'd give the phone a 3.5 instead of a 3, but the misplacement of the power button irritates me enough from a design perspective and daily use perspective that I have to knock points off more for that, along with the other cons. Even so, there ARE much worse phones out there, and this could still be a good, basic, smart phone for those who can work around the quirks. Alternative: The LG L9 (Android) is a T-Mobile phone that Best Buy and Amazon regularly put on sale from $179 to $199, and it's a much more feature rich mid-range phone than the Nokia 521. If you can handle the Android OS and don't insist on Win 8, then the LG might be worth looking into for only a few dollars more.","June 18, 2013",

mobile phone,"Very Good Phone, Need to spend $$ for maps","Sailing Guy ""Steve""",RRC7B7DUPT6DY,3,"It is a very good phone for the price. The only issue is that the advertisement on the Microsoft Store states,""The Nokia Lumia 521 is a premium 4G smartphone at a great price. It includes apps like HERE Maps, which features true offline maps for 94 countries, and HERE Drive, free voice-guided navigation.""In fact, I am in USA and there I am only able to use Here Drive map for USA country. Canada not even included. For other countries, you have to pay an extra $19.95 (1/4 of the cost of the phone). I had at least expected Canada to be available as is the case for most stand-alone GPS navigators.The advertisement/description on Microsoft Store website is somewhat MISLEADING, in my view. I would recommend to Microsoft to fix this ASAP to indicate that only the USA map works for USA customers (your region only).","June 2, 2014",

mobile phone,"A great phone for talk & text & music, but not much else",ariel,R132PIT9TIVM7L,3,"I really like the look of this phone and nokia has always made their phones very durable. I got this phone refurbished so some of my critiques may be due to extended misuse.Pros:The call quality was really good and exceeded the iphone in many ways. For the first time I could actually have a clear conversation and the speaker phone was of equal quality.There seems to be more storage on this camera than other phones, which makes it great for holding music, games, and pictures.Everything is on the front screen, but sometimes it can feel overwhelming the first time you use it. after awhile, you get use to it.Cons:The touch calibration on the phone was a little sensitive and you can adjust it in the settings, but I noticed that even after adjusting it, the phone was still difficult to navigate through.I noticed that most of the apps I use on a daily basis (banking, social media, and email) were a little dull and not rated highly in the app store. The quality of the apps were extremely slow, but I found that using the internet explorer was a little faster than using the actual app.The camera on the nokia is really bad. It is extremely grainy and even worse in low light settings. I have been spoiled by the iphone camera and I have become very reliant on a quality camera.I hope this helps. I would recommend this phone to someone who likes to talk and text, but if you have an online business or are internet famous, then this phone will drive you crazy.","April 15, 2014",

I've tried to find alternative music players that will work better but they all seem to have the same issue. No flash means no flashlight function which is unfortunate. No silence button so you have to go through the settings function to silence and unsilence the ringer. For now, quite a few of the iphone apps I used do not have a windows version yet. However, no other smartphone on the market for anywhere near this price so still the best option if you just cannot bring yourself to spend hundreds of dollars on a cell phone.","November 7, 2013",
mobile phone,Great phone... for its price,emag,R3FWRM7N6J5TAW,3,"The Lumia 521 is a great phone for its price... but it's a $100 smartphone, and corners were very obviously cut. If you're a first time smartphone buyer, you may not know what you're missing, but if you're a Android (Nexus) or iOS user, you'll definitely feel the downgrade.I've had the device for about three months now, and I'd like to share my observations.Pros:+The WP8 layout/style is appealing+Performance/responsiveness is solid (especially compared to Android devices)+Idle/low-use battery life is great+Nokia Music offers ad-free streaming music+Nice physical construction+Simple, expandable storage+Live tiles bring the best elements of widgets into a sane formatCons:-Screen is mediocre (resolution and viewing angles are tolerable/sufficient, but not great; a little small; poor contrast/black levels)-App support is extremely lacking (and free apps are generally ad-riddled)-Internet Explorer/UC Browser can't handle large/multiple web pages, and Opera Mini isn't available-Music/podcasting support is very poor (no gapless playback, regardless of app; no playback speed adjustment; built-in podcast support is weak and other podcast apps cannot automatically update; playlist support needs to improve)-Lack of Google services/support, even using Internet Explorer-Scrolling vertically through the homescreen to get to apps/live tiles is cumbersome-Multitasking is quite limited; most apps require a lengthy resume process upon switching-Active/moderate usage drains battery fast (note that there's a bug in Internet Explorer that will let it keep running scripts even if it is closed)-There's a dedicated hardware Bing! buttonWishlist: I'd love for Microsoft to offer some better app organization (e.g., horizontally scrolling hub-style home screen), a better core media app (gapless playback, simplified design, sane podcast management), and switch the search button back to fast, context-sensitive searches (with a long-press for full Bing) in WP8.1.Overall: I'm using the Lumia 521 primarily for media playback (while at the gym or on the go) and as a quick-reference second screen, and it's mostly fine for those purposes (with the caveats listed above). It's a huge step down from iOS in terms of apps, though -- not only are games right out, but banking apps, city services (paying parking meter fare, etc.), hobby/website apps, GMail, Pulse, Opera Mini and the like are also unavailable and the closest equivalents/workarounds are a tremendous downgrade. Overall, I'm still happier with the 521 than I've been with any non-Nexus Android phone/tablet I've owned, and I may very well make it my main phone/portable device if supplemented with a tablet (probably an iPad Mini).In summary, if you're unwilling to spend more than $100 for a smartphone (and can't find a used iPhone 4 or better for that price), the Lumia 521 is the device to get. Just note that it's a big step down from high-end devices (iPhone 4 or better, Nexus 4, HTC One, Galaxy S4/Note 3) and the app ecosystem is much, much worse than what you'd find on iOS or Android.","October 14, 2013",

This phone has gotten some getting used to on how it works and what shortcuts it has (or doesn't) and some of the apps made for windows phones are bad (I hate the available gmail apps). The T-Mobile service is ok, but it's hard for me to comment because since I've gotten this phone I've mostly been on an island off the coast of NC and there is not good service here anyway. I only get 2G here. I don't really like that with the $50 plan you only get 1 gig of 4G per month as I imagine once I leave the island I will go through that pretty quickly.

This is the best phone available with that plan under $275.Pros:- Five years ago people would have paid a lot of money for the functionality you get in this phone- This phone from Amazon works with the Wal-Mart plan. This phone is replacing one that got wet and wouldn't text anymore. We just swapped out the SIM card. (Before you do that, make sure to back up your apps to the cloud if you can, then using the Nokia ""Transfer My Data"" app to transfer your contacts with Bluetooth. Your old phone needs to be functional for this to work).- Unlike Apple products, the virtual keyboard makes it clear when a letter is capitalized.Cons- Nowadays this phone is relatively mediocre- Call quality is ok- Touchscreen is somewhat touchy and the virtual keyboard can be difficult to use- The Wifi calling feature almost never works, and when it's on it interferes with texting- The biggest problem with it is that it's a Windows phone. The number of apps available for Windows phones is abysmal.

The speaker is better than my old phone and voice recognition seems to work well. The screen is fine, but not the newer super duper never break never get fingerprint screens. My main complaint is the maps. It got exists wrong. What I mean is, the directions would say something like ""take exit to XXX street"" where the actual exit would say something else, like ""Highway YY."" This could get confusing. It's especially strange since Bing Maps on the web show the directions correctly. Also, in the navigation app, I could not find a way to view the route that it calculated or suggest alternate routes. This is a major drawback as I usually like to look at the direction list when I start the navigation, and sometimes whiles stopped someplace so I can keep track of where I am.

mobile phone,A decent smart phone. 3.5 stars,Eric,R10FN41XBVY16S,3,"I was willing to purchase a cheap smart phone just so I may use the internet sparingly for email and for some organization.The phone works well most of the time, the touch screen is nice, the operating system is okay, and the ability to customize home screen is cool (But standard like all smart phones). speed of web browsing is good and battery saver settings are superb and make a full battery last about two or three days with phone calls and texts, and very minimal web browsing.So what are the drawbacks?About once or twice a week, when i click the button on the side of the phone (That turns the display on or off), the phone screen stays black and will not function until you remove the battery and put it back in. After the long load up time, its fine again. Other than that, no real problems..but it is tedious and annoying.Also, the phone camera is only decent (which is expected) but there is no flash feature.

mobile phone,Its OK,cute!,RDWPXDJ438AH4,3,"okay. So this is the real deal. bought the phone at target and with tmboile 50$ plan. Its OK for it's price. here are the prosPROS:Good for price.Looks and feels good in hand.Phone signal is decent.Volume is ok.Have never drop a call on me.Overall this phone is good. It does what it does. Txting is good. The keypad is good! as good as my 4th gen ipod! The camera is better than my ipod too!Cons.Now what i dont like about this phone is that the BATTERY LIFE SUCKS. Even when its full and im not using it, it loses life really fast. So shutting it down is recommended but turning it back on is a pain in the butt! There's been more than one time when the lumia would just shut donw it self and then it would fail to turn back on no matter how many times i turn it on! Its been a few weeks that this hasn;t happen(ive own it for 3 and a half month).Another things is it is low on apps, which doesnt bother me at all.FB app(for those who likes) is really bad. Scrolling down newsfeed is so annoying! Just flicking the screen sometmes will take you to a fb page that you havent seen before! fiX!","December 10, 2013",
mobile phone,Mixed feelings,T,R3V3KRZTKOYUAP,3,"I purchased this phone here a couple weeks ago, and I am using it on the T-Mobile network.UPDATE 1/1/14: I am a couple weeks into using a replacement. Many of my previous comments still hold. A few updates below.On the bright side:- The price is low for all the features of this phone. If it works as advertised, this is a great bargain as an entry level smartphone.- I had not used Windows 8 before, but I found the tiled interface easy to navigate. Tiles for all of the basic functions I want the phone to perform are right there, and I can reorganize them.- The touchscreen is normally very responsive.- Overall, the small size and weight are comfortable for me to hold (although I do use a case for better grip).- Pictures are okay, but I did not have high expectations based on other reviews. UPDATE 1/1/14: Pictures taken outdoors in good light are actually pretty good. Crisp with accurate color.There are a few things that keep it from being a perfect phone (for me).- I am not a fan of the back cover, that is having to press in on it and pry it off with my nails to access the battery, SIM and memory card. I have imagined breaking the phone in half, however unlikely, or losing grip and flipping this thing across the room which is very, very likely to happen one day. But maybe that's just me.- Signal strength is fine outdoors, but very poor indoors. One or two bars poor. No dropped calls yet, but a lot of breaking up and having to repeat myself. I briefly started looking into signal boosters, but it seems the more effective ones can be up to $300. I was not expecting this additional expense to use a $100 phone. I will check with Nokia and T-Mobile to see if they have other solutions, but poor signal strength is a big deal for me because I want a phone primarily to speak to people and not as much for other tasks and entertainment. I use other devices for that.- But on the other hand...the app store for Windows Phone seems limiting. The selection isn't that large and a lot of it looks like third-party apps I've never heard of and I'm not sure I want to deal with.- For some reason, it keeps losing the WiFi connection even when I've been near the router. UPDATE 1/1/14: Maintaining the WiFi connection hasn't been a problem with the replacement phone.I may have received a defective one. The touchscreen on my phone became nonresponsive for a while today. I had placed a call that went to the recipient's voicemail, but when I tried to hang up, tapping 'end call,' or the home and back buttons didn't do anything. I hit the power button on the side, and I got the screen that said slide down to power off - hurray for physical buttons - but touching the screen still produced no results. I had to take the battery out. A few reviewers advised not to download too many apps at once. I only downloaded two apps to the phone from sources I thought I could trust.UPDATE 1/1/14: It has only been a couple weeks, but the replacement phone has not frozen up like the first one. I have also downloaded several apps (including the two I downloaded to the first phone) without noticing a change in the overall performance of the phone. The first phone might have had a defect.I'm willing to give it another chance and boost the rating if I don't have another problem like that again.UPDATE 1/1/14: The 3-star rating will stay where it is for now because of different issues. I intended to use this for voice and text, but I tried to use the music + videos app. Unless you are a diehard Windows fan, my advice is to leave that alone. Basic music management tasks are tedious. Navigating the Windows site for help is (still) a chore and revealed a slew of issues users are having with basic functionality of some of the apps. For a tutorial in counterintuitive design, just go to windowsphone.com and search for instructions on ""creating a playlist."" Read it and weep, people. Download music files from SkyDrive to your Windows Phone? No. If you're not concerned about some apps having a bewildering complexity or limitations, or getting fast help with them, then this phone may be fine for you. I think the Lumia 521 is fine as a basic phone, so that's how I'll have to use it.At least I bought it here and I may still have a chance to exchange it.UPDATE 1/1/14: The replacement process, initiated online, with Amazon was easy and fast. Just returned the first one at UPS and the new one came shortly after. Simple as that. Thanks, Amazon!","December 9, 2013",
mobile phone,good for talking/texting ... not a lot more,cerealus,R25QHQMER5XOWW,3,"I started with an iPhone 3 ... had that almost 3yr ... then I went to android Galaxy (a nice one) ... then a cheaper Galaxy (""exhibit"" ... no-contract)Just a few weeks ago, I bought my first Windows 8 device ... an 8in tablet ... with 8.1 on it ... despite the lack of anything resembling a Swype-style keyboard, I was very, very impressed with itI didn't expect a Windows phone to be like my new tablet ... but I also couldn't imagine it'd be so far off ... and it didn't have to be!First and foremost, unlike (possibly) many other iPhone or android phone owners, I don't (actually) use my phone for much ... other than making phone calls ... and the occasional text ... even then, it's not much ... it's very much a matter of convenience for me to have one ... and I could probably easily go w/o, entirelyI like android ... there's things I don't like ... but IMO, apple and Windows (at least their phone OS) don't even come close to what android offers (flame away!)By all rights, I should've bought an S3 or S4 mini ... that would very much be the phone I'd prefer ... and, now that I say it, for another $150, that probly woulda been smart money ... but, I really like getting deals ... and $80 for a Nokia ""smart"" phone seemed too good to pass up ... particularly for what I actually use a phone for (my tablets are another story, entirely)That said, MS saw fit to provide absolutely NO way to look at the files ... either on your phone ... or on your microsd card ... NONE! ... best ya can do is find an app by someone (no, not MS ... not apple ... not google ... no one like that), install it, and cross your fingers ... which I did ... it would not display basically any file I had on my microsd because they do not end with a ""y"" ... SERIOUSLY! ... check it out!Also, and this is the #1 problem with my tablet, as well ... the onscreen keyboard is pick-n-poke ONLY ... no Swyping (swyper)! If you're not used to using Swype on android, this is probly no big deal to you ... but once you're used to Swyping, taking it away is very, very unsettling ... again, I don't use my phone for much ... for texting, no Swyping is a pain ... but I'm not writing novels, eitherI'm not gonna whine about the lack of apps ... there's actually a fair number of apps ... and most of em look to suck pretty hard ... but if anyone thinks the vast majority of android apps don't suck, they're off their rocker! That said, I'm not seeing a GMail app by Google ... a few by what's-his-name ... ya, I'm gonna give you my gmail credentials!It did come with Office ... that's pretty neat ... so, I go to open a tab-delimited file I got on my skydrive (same account) ... right in Excel, they got a menu that says ""skydrive"" ... I tap it ... it opens IE!!!! ... REALLY?!!! ... so eventually I install the skydrive app (why it didn't come with the phone, I can't imagine ... particularly considering the bloatware they otherwise got on there) ... anyhow, even the skydrive app knows nothing of Excel ... and aside from its existence, Excel knows nothing of skydrive ... and of course, there's no way, in Excel, to navigate any files, to open a tab-delimited file. I imagine, if ya otherwise got an .xls on there, it's like photos, songs, or videos ... there's probly a scanner that keeps track of what's on there, and tells the appEvery once in a while, we'd joke with a younger guy about to get married ... tell him horror stories, and how he's gonna regret it. Excel is very much like this. If you're married to it, things may be ok ... but if ya ever want a divorce, LOOK OUT!I had Polaris Office on my Galaxy ... that was excellent! ... even then, I had to download a Google spreadsheet at work, so I could open it with Excel, to save it as an earlier version, that Polaris could open ... and then I learned, only Samsung devices can run Polaris! ... everything else is garbage!It's amazing to me, in 2013 ... some 30yr after Lotus-1-2-3, I can't pass around a spreadsheet w/o running into either someone doesn't have software to open it ... or their software just can't open my version of it ... and/or they otherwise gotta be using a particular brand of hardware ... or otherwise pay $100+/yr ... just for the privilege of keeping data in rows and columns!... but I digress ... I didn't take the star off cause of the fact that everyone wants to get paid, one way or the other, for using spreadsheets ... I took the star off cause Excel on this phone has no clue what's going on with my skydrive ... and unlike my tablet, even though the set-up asked me if I wanted to, my phone has no clue about my skydrive ... or at least, if it does, I have no way to find the files on my phone, that're otherwise also on my skydrive ... I honestly can't imagine no one lost their job over this!otherwise, like switching between apple and android, Windows phones have their own idiosyncrasies ... in the case of windows, you need to navigate from the ""start"" to get to ""settings"", than work your way down, to find things like ""bluetooth"" and ""running apps"" ... not the least of which, ""blocking background tasks"" and ""battery-saver option"" ... vs. merely swiping from the top, or one corner, on android ... and tapping :""bluetooth"", and the likespeaking of the battery, I'm hoping it's good enough to last a full day ... on stand-by! ... but if you like to use your phone for much more than talking/texting (or a lot of that) throughout the day, you should probably carry a cord with ya!now for the really bad news ... so, there's three ""buttons"" along the bottom ... ""<--"" (back), (home), and (search) ... guess what (search) does?! ... it opens BING!!!! .... even when ya don't mean to brush your thumb against that area of the screen, it opens BING!!!At the end of the day, it's a Nokia ... and despite the shortcomings, the Windows OS on it appears to drive phone calling and texting just fine ... despite attempting to get ya to open an ""XBox account"" every time, even the music app ain't too bad ... it also comes with a built-in FM radio (uses the headphones wire as an antenna) ... and it works quite well!As a phone, for the price they're going for now, to spend any less on a Sparq er whatever is absolutely insane!This is a ""good"" phone! ... it's no S3 er S4 ... but it's still a ""good"" phone!","December 13, 2013",
mobile phone,"Great phone, if you get a good one.",T. Craw,R23KG5BOCIY1L2,3,"I bought two of these phones from Amazon recently, and here's my take on the phone.The phone itself is fantastic. It's just the right size. Not so big that you have to hold it with both hands, and not so small that you feel cheated. The look and feel of W8 on this device is amazing. It's such a smooth platform. And I think it's really user friendly. The only thing I didn't care for is that they don't have all the apps I use, yet, and that I have to set up a Microsoft account to download apps. Both just bothersome, not deal breakers. Sadly one of the two phones I bought is going back. It repeatedly turns itself off for no apparent reason. It can happen in middle of a call or when it's just sitting around. 90% of the time when it comes back on it's in airplane mode. So I go to the settings to turn that mode off, and it won't let me. SO, I have to take my protective case off (a PINB by the way), take the back of the phone off, and pull the battery out and reinsert for it to come back on in the correct mode. The other phone, which is my husband's, hasn't had this problem, so I'm hoping it was an isolated incident. I don't want to take any chances though, so I opted for the full refund and will wait for the Nexus 5 to hit. Basically, get this phone because it's a great deal for this price, but make sure yours isn't a dud before your return window is closed.On another note, totally unrelated to the 3 star review of this product, is the terrible service I received from Amazon on this item. I've never had shipping problems with them before, but they really dropped the ball on this one. It took them a whole 6 days after I ordered to even ship the item. Once it was shipped it sat at the carriers facility for another 2 days before they sent it on it's way. Total fail! I would have understood if the item was back ordered, but they were showing in stock the whole time.","July 20, 2013",

Today I talked to someone at T-Mobile who was knowledgeable and he showed me how to get it to ring again.

mobile phone,Good phone if you just talk and text,Valeriya Zelenyak,RRI07MJ0NERD8,3,"If all you need in a phone is talk and text, this phone is perfect for you. On this phone, my internet was slower and my facebook feed was inconsistent with the feed on my computer. There is no facetime camera, nor is there flash therefore there is no flashlight. The app store is horrible. The version for yahoo mail and gmail is has an inconvenient interface. If you want to play up-to-date games, forget about it. I could only get the first version of temple run (which is about 3 years old), and a few other games that aren't too interesting or developed. A smartphone should be great features that do cool things but the program was extremely simple. Also the keyboard was not very comfortable. Again, if you are not tech savvy this phone is perfect for you. If you are a person who constantly needs to keep in touch for work and school on email and update documents on drive, save up and buy a better phone.","January 30, 2014",

mobile phone,"Battery doesn't fit properly, otherwise a great phone.",Pmm368,R1TNA4OA9WVRHP,3,"After some debate if I should get this phone (since it's a Windows phone), I purchased this phone on the 24th October, 2013 at a local Wal-Mart for $100. For the first 3 days I had this running, it worked great. Over the last 4 days, this phone has been restarting itself several times (usually 3 to 7 times) a day. Turns out the battery doesn't fit in the phone properly (little bit of wiggle room, causes the battery to come loose from the battery terminals on the phone).Pros:5MP camera.The pictures come out better than I thought, sometimes the photo comes out blurry but the majority of the time it takes pictures really well. Shoots video in 720P High Definition at 10mbps.4G HSPA+Not LTE, but decent. The coverage is great in my area and I get anywhere between 4 & 8 mbps download speeds. The ping is usually between 80 & 100 MS.Mobile Hotspot.This phone allows you to tether your internet connection, depending on your plan.GPSBest GPS I've used on a phone. The GPS I've used on any of my previous Android phones would give me turn-by-turn directions, but Windows is the only one I've used that tells me the speed limit in an area. I can also use it to tell me how fast I'm travelling and how far I've traveled. I had to install a separate app on Android to do that.Cons:Music. Transferring music to the phone seems to be a pain in the rear. I transferred music using Windows Media Player, but after I deleted a folder, none of my music showed up in my phone again.Battery. As stated above, battery is fairly loose from the battery terminal on the phone, causing it to restart on me several times in a day. It usually happens when it's in my pocket while I'm walking.Transferring files off the phone via online storage. I installed dropbox, hoping to be able to upload photos to my dropbox, but I can only put it on my skydrive. Videos can only be uploaded over WiFi to prevent going over your data package.Transferring files via bluetooth. I have sent files from this phone to an Android tablet and it works good. I can only transfer pictures via bluetooth, but not videos.Overall, I would've given this phone a 4 star if it hadn't been for the battery problem I'm facing. I'll update if the company (either Nokia or T-Mobile) is able to fix this problem.Edit 11/1/13My phone has shut itself off 14 times from 10pm 10/31/13 to 7:30am 11/1/13. I'm not taking a chance on trying another Lumia phone. I was hoping for a more reliable phone for $100.Edit 11/3/13I returned the phone back to the store to get my money back. Unfortunately, Wal-mart wouldn't let me keep the sim card, which contained my phone number that I wanted to keep. I started a number port to my home phone, so I'm hoping Wal-mart keeps it active long enough for the transfer to go through. Oh well, this is what I get for going 10 years of not having a Nokia phone (haven't heard about Nokia until the Lumia line-up)","October 31, 2013",
mobile phone,Not sure what all the hype is for....,"shmitty01 ""shmitty01""",R1OYFYVOBYPSNQ,3,"I purchased this phone 7 months ago as a primary phone for my wife. At first, I was impressed with the features vs price. It quickly became evident why this phone is so cheap. The problems started showing up quickly, and only got worse with time. As t mobile has poor coverage at our home, wifi calling was crucial for this phone to work. First, windows phone OS is not capable of MMS over wifi calling. This may not matter to some people, but we like to exchange pictures with friends and relatives, and this is not possible over wifi calling with this phone. Issue 2, also related to wifi calling. Frequent dropped calls, poor call quality, etc. Sometimes the calls were great, sometimes very bad. As time continued, another problem with wifi calling came up. When you would leave the house and return, the phone would refuse to reconnect to wifi calling(while connected to the network fine) and would show no signal. The phone required a hard reset to resolve the issue. As for the good, the camera is ....ok. The phone is fairly durable. Battery life is great. I have always had a great love for nokia phones because of their call quality and durability. This phone has lost me for nokia permanently. Maybe the problems are all related to windows 8, I am not certain. We have since upgraded to a Samsung Galaxy Light, and guess what? It works! And it works really well at that. Not sure why we stuck with this dud for so long. Maybe if you have excellent t mobile coverage and no need for wifi calling, this phone could work for you as a budget entry level smart phone.

I won't do a bash fest but I'll just say do your research on the incompatibility issues that are going on with Xbox music, Nokia music, windows media player, and the windows 8 phone apps. Short examples = track duplication, disappearing tracks, photo duplication, disappearing album art, disappearing playlist, etc.. I'm not a tech newbie and have many friends who are tech savvy who also cannot figure out whats going on. Our (very cynical) conclusion is Microsoft is doing their Microsoft thing... hoping that their customers will figure out what the problem is. This is not just specific to this particular phone but across the windows 8 platform.This is coming from a windows man who thinks that other than the music issue this is a great little phone that is just right for that person who wants to try out the Wp8 platform against the i OS and Android.Not a terribly big issue, but one just the same, that is not being pointed out enough in reviews. Like I said just do the research before you make the purchase if music functionality on your phone is important to you.

mobile phone,Its an okay phone.,Tom,R2GFQME4LOTURX,3,"Honestly, this phone isn't THAT great after almost a year experience. Compared to what you can get out of other phones of the same price, don't get this one.Cons -- Sometimes the camera app won't even open, just black screen that it sends you back to the home screen.- App store has a bunch of rip-offs and the good apps arent even well made.- ""Nokia Mix Radio"" is terrible- Battery doesn't last more than 6 hours when power saver is off and brightness is on low.- Isnt much you can do with the phone, no really good games, or utility apps you may get out of iOS or Android. Mainly text and calling.Pros -- 8MP camera is okay.- Texting is pretty smooth.- Talk is pretty smooth.- Home screen is very customizable.- Not a slow phone, and even after a year of use it hasnt gotten any slower- Durable, I never got a case for it and only one time did it get bad cracks, were I replaced the phone entirely.Overall, get an android or iphone.

mobile phone,You get what you pay for...,Joy Eve,RPX9VW56REKL1,3,"I bought this phone because I was in need of a major upgrade from a non smart phone. The price is amazing considering there's no contract that comes along with it... However, I've realized that you get what you pay for. The first 2 weeks with this phone were fine, however, soon it started turning off by itself (meaning the power button doesn't do anything.) The screen just goes black and I have to wait for some time for it to react. Very inconvenient during emergencies and just in general. Another problem is that there are multiple thumbnails of picture and photo albums, but just one physical copy of the picture. So when I try to delete the picture, the whole file disappears. Another downside is that the Windows Store for app, games, etc. is SO very limited. That means no Instagram, Vine, Snapchat, etc. (Yes, there are copy cat apps for it, but it just isn't the same.)I will be keeping this phone for some time, at least until I can afford a more high end smartphone. Overall, the phone is easy to maneuver.I would give this phone 2 stars, but the good pricing forces me to give 3.I will update on positive and negative points of this phone after further use. Please feel free to ask any questions!","November 2, 2013",
mobile phone,"OK, not great.","J. Hastings ""DryHeat""",R3UA7CYQ4N5T1Q,3,"I have used Nokia and T-Mobile for some time and have always used relatively cheap phones. I break them and don't need a game phone. My last phone was a Nokia X2 with a standard buttons and a real QWERTY keyboard. The Lumia is the first touch screen phone I have used. I used both phones with the same T-Mobile 1500 min of voice and text plus 30 megs of data. Yes that is megs and not gigs. I don't need a lot of data. I have had the phone for over a month now. That is the context for this review.You can go from the X2 to the Lumia easily for very basic use. Beyond that it takes some time to learn. Finding how to do things often takes searching the internet for them. This is a Windows 8 phone but it is not like your win 7 desktop. On the X2 you could select an item and then you would have a key for options. In win 7 you would have drop down menus of options. You have neither on the Lumia. Some options are hidden. Some options are little icons, very little. There are a lot of them but usually only a few on a screen at a time. If you need reading glasses you will want to have them ready until you know the icons by placement. There is also on some screens a ""..."" which indicate there is more information below the bottom of the screen, that can be accessed by sliding the image up. In some other cases there are option that have to be taken while selecting an item, not after it is selected. To select an item you just tap it, but to bring up options touch and hold the item.On the main (home) screen there is a phone icon. If you tap it a list of calls, incoming, outgoing, and missed, comes up. At the bottom are four icons, voicemail, keypad, people, search, and ""..."". If you slide the image up you will see the names of the icons and two more options, Delete All, and Settings. There are no other option to see. No option for sorting the calls by incoming, outgoing or missed, something I could do on the X2. I did find that if I touch and hold a number there is an option to delete that call. I like to keep missed calls and some special calls listed in the call history so ""delete all"" is not an option for me. The delete call option is actually easier and quicker to use than the options menu and buttons on the X2. You just have to know how to find it.Another option that took me some time to find was for forwarding text messages or resending them. From the Home screen there is a Messaging icon. Tapping it brings up a list of threads or conversations. If you tap on one a list of messages in that thread appear. Again, there are little icons at the bottom and the ""..."". You will want to check them out. If you want to forward a message or resend an old one you have to know there are options that come up by touching and holding an entry for a message, delete, forward and copy. However, if there is only one message in a thread then you only have that and when you tap on the thread you go right into the message and those three options are not offered. If you touch and hold the listing for the thread the only option you get is to delete the thread. If I am wrong about this someone let me know. This is more difficult than on the X2.I have large fingers and I need to hold the phone in landscape orientation and not portrait or I get to many errors where it thinks I want the next key over. In landscape orientation the keyboard is better than the X2. Otherwise the X2 is better.Sometime the Lumia does not respond to my touch. This mostly happen with incoming calls and I can't get it to answer. It does not happen often and it can be with other features too, not just calls.Once the Lumia froze and I had to take the battery out. To do it as the instructions say is almost impossible for me. I find it easiest to do by releasing the side opposite the power button first. Be careful, the halves can be hard to hang onto. There is suppose to be a way to reboot the Lumia holding the power button but it did not work for me.The camera can be better than the one in the X2, which was not much good, but not always. The problem with the camera is it needs good lighting or any movement of the subject or camera causes terrible blur. In the sunshine it does a good job.On the plus side. The Lumia has data use controls that limit the data use. If you make good use of them you can get by with the 30 meg limit on the prepay plans. On the home screen is a Data Sense icon. Using Data Sense you can let the Lumia know how many days you have until your megs expire, and how many megs you have. I add a few days and reduce the number megs to leave me some extra room but I don't seem to need to do that. The Data Sense icon will display the numbers of days and megs left. In the setting for the Lumia under Celluar is a setting for Data Connection. You can turn that off and stop data use on the cellular network. There is another for Limited Wi-Fi Connectivity and another for Data Roaming.WiFi works for me. The use of data over Wi-Fi does count against my data limit. I have not paid much attention to whether calls count. 1500 min has been more than enough for me anyway. I assume Wi-Fi calls do not. At the end of my plan's 30 days I download maps and apps with my remaining megs.If I use the Lumia much the battery runs out much faster than the X2. It also charges faster. Not a big deal for me.The voice quality of callers is probably the best of any phone I have had. The phone feels good and fits my media pocket on my pants.If you want a Windows phone it is good for the money, but it is not a great phone.","September 23, 2013",

It's a beautiful phone. I plugged it in and powered it on and started playing with it. Unfortunately I was at work and got up to wait on a customer and when I returned the screen was lit but not on. I assumed the battery had just died, so I left it alone for 6 hours while I finished my shift. It still wouldn't turn on.

mobile phone,My first dance with a Windows phone,A. Clark,R36BYF84BMPXG2,3,"The 928 didn't live up to all the rave reviews here and on Verizon's site, in my experience. I sent back my glossy little white 928. Well, not little, it's big, and heavy. Too much. With a case this thing flopped around like a mini brick in my pocket, and the sharp corners made taking it out of my front pockets about as easy as taking well-used bubble gum out of your pocket. Didn't like the three buttons on one side, at all, and I pressed that @#$% camera button accidentally more times than I can say. Had lots of candid shots of my toes and the living room and blurry who knows what, but luckily they automatically downloaded to sky drive so I had to go delete them there also. Actually, I know it is handy to have them automatically backed up like that, but only if you don't mind everything getting backed up. I love the idea of a designated camera button, but it really should be some small, round button near a top corner or something. Or, maybe it's just how I hold a phone, but the three button setup on one side didn't work for me. Also, keyboard (and it's all you get) doesn't have a way to enter numbers on the main board..you have to go into a second screen for numbers, then back to the other screen for letters. This became really frustrating as so many emails, passwords, not to mention texts and emails have plenty of numbers and letters thrown in there. Keyboard autocorrects decently well, but is still lacking in several ways. It was much like the OS in general..very fluid and uncluttered, but over-simple not always in a good way. The good: low light camera..they tout this for a reason, but, for me anyway, doesn't make a phone in and of itself. Live Tiles are different..I think many will like the kind of mosaic, visual page they create (I did), while others will miss their static droid and iphone screens and think the windows phone looks chaotic. Live tiles often don't update quickly enough to be very useful (say, battery percentage, for one), but overall kind of different and fun. OS does work fluidly with most apps, which is nice. Email like gmail and yahoo worked well with the built in email app, loved it. However, it's sort of a take it or leave it OS and app store, very much like iOS, though of course Apple has a vast app store. If you like Windows Phone ok, then great, because that's it. No notifications, which Windows Phone will probably fix as it's just become too much a part of people's other smartphone experiences: ESPN news or scores for your favorite team, say..no go on the windows phone. Or just having all your notifications at a glance on one page. Again, some won't mind, but for others very frustrating. I'm not a social media fiend or even hard core phone user, and I still missed my notifications (and a notification light on the front, which 928 does not have)As much as I wanted to try something different, it was hard not to keep getting the sneaking feeling my phone was behind the time, by at least a year if not more. Obviously some don't mind and want something different enough that they're willing to wait it out as Windows throws money at developers to at least get the 'normal' stuff out in Windows apps. Not to say 928 doesn't work quickly..no problem with speed and whatnot..then again I fully expect that of any new phone I get. Battery life..so so. And the phone ran hot way too often for my comfort. On the plus side, wireless charging is available for this phone and is an awesome feature. IMHO, that should be universal for all smartphones today, but alas no. Also, despite battery life being mediocre (and no ability to swap batteries like you can with the galaxies, for example) I will say it charged quickly. It was nice to be at about 20% and get most of it charged back up in about an hour. That's great. I just found myself not enjoying my 'phone experience' as days went on..the shape and heft, the button placement, the concessions you need to make (just being able to change your tiles from red to mauve does not mean customization in my book). I also had what I assume were SIM problems, but I don't know how much to blame on the phone. A couple times texts would not go through, then suddenly would later in the day. On first activation it took a long time and several attempts to reseat the SIM to get it working. Later, a couple times my phone went dead and would not turn on, then magically after minutes or hours would just turn on by itself. Not confidence-inspiring, and unfortunately you just don't have the luxury of seeing whether things work themselves out as time goes on. Worthy of note here: if you need to return your contract upgrade phone via amazon, do it as quick as you can. I returned it within the 14 day Verizon mandate, but of course after shipping time, processing time, etc., it was past the 14 day, and Verizon makes you jump through some hoops. I called both customer services..Verizon will treat you like a bit of second class citizen if you don't buy through their store, so be ready. Amazon cell phone cust service was great however, and I had to call them a couple times before finally getting my upgrade date reset by Verizon. You will have a few more do-it-yourself moments if you purchase through another vendor like Amazon, BB, etc., but price usually makes it worth it (for me anyway)..just be ready to have a bit of hassle here or there perhaps. Again, AMazon service (the specific cell phone folk) were friendly and helped a good deal and even will help you activate your old phone if you wish now that you've had to send your new one back..the worst of it was some waiting and some being put on long hold, which is sort of part of the deal. Anyway, wish I could have loved the 928 as much as I wanted to, but didn't feel comfortable thinking of 2 yrs with the phone. For the price, super..I think that is what has them getting a ton sold, which is smart on their part. Overall that can only help both Nokia and Windows Phone, but, again, we're looking down the road a bit to see the benefit.","June 30, 2013",
mobile phone,A decent alternative to the Apple and Google world.,"William Grose ""Tzu Crazy""",R29VS9MUILVTR0,3,"I've been an Apple person for many years now, but curiosity had me checking out the Lumia 928, and I'm glad I did. Given that this Nokia is a flagship device for Windows Phone 8, it's only fair to compare it to Apple's flagship, the iPhone 5.First things first. The Nokia Lumia 928 is by no means a light phone. At 162 grams (my scale says 166 grams), it's noticeably heavier than the iPhone 5 at 112 grams. This means the Lumia is roughly 50% heavier than the iPhone.The 4.5"" screen on the Lumia 928 puts out 1280x768 pixels vs the 4"" iPhone 5 with 1136x640 resolution. This translates into 334 pixels per inch on the Lumia vs the iPhone 5's 326 pixels per inch. On paper it sounds like the Lumia 928 is the sharper display, but in practice this is not the case. Because of the pentile arrangement of pixels on the Lumia, text especially just comes across a little... fuzzy. It's certainly not awful, and if you've never used an iPhone 4/4S/5 or for example an HTC ONE, you'd perhaps not notice. In any case, this is not the sharpest display on the market - the iPhone 5 is noticeably sharper. The HTC ONE is the sharpest of them all (sharper than the Galaxy S4). The Lumia display is very vibrant, though, due to its OLED display. It's a little too vibrant for some people, but it certainly can't be accused of being washed out!The Camera:The 8.7MP camera on the Lumia 928 really shines. It takes some of the best low-light photos I've seen on a mobile device. It certainly does a better job than my iPhone 5. Very impressive. While I don't care for direct flash devices, the xenon flash here does help in extremely low light, and the Lumia 928 also uses it to help achieve focus. Daytime photos also look fantastic. The bar has been raised here for low-light phone photography, no question.The Phone:I've found the call quality to be excellent, with little/no distortion at the higher volumes. It just works well. The speakerphone is also quite loud.Apps:This is the biggest problem with Windows Phone 8. There are quite simply not enough apps available. If you're thinking of switching from Android, - and especially iOS, you may want to check to see if your favorite apps are even available for the Windows Phone platform. Chances are, - they're not.I downloaded a few of my favorite apps (from iOS) on the Lumia, - ""Plex,"" and ""Words with Friends."" ""Plex"" just didn't run as well over my network, dropping frames from streamed video. And ""Words with Friends"" is just a travesty of an app. All the smoothness is gone. It crashes a lot, doesn't have some of the newer features from Android/iOS (like giving you a word-score total before submitting the word etc).And gaming is a total downer on Windows Phone 8 for several reasons. First, there are very few games available, and the ones that are available just don't run that well on the Lumia 928. This is likely to do with the (relatively speaking) outdated 1.5 Ghz dual-core processor.Functionality:The Lumia 928 situates all its buttons on the right side of the device. The volume up/down, power, and camera button all feel very similar, and it's not at all obvious which way up you're holding the phone when you pick it up. After several days of use, I'm still struggling to find the power button, which is situated in between the volume buttons and the camera button. I wish the power button was at the top of the phone...Overall: I really do like the Windows Phone platform. But it's certainly not perfect. Multitasking is a bit of a mess (you can't close apps unless you go into them and then back out), and the lack of actual good, solid apps is a REAL problem. The other issue is the hardware. While nothing here would be considered ""bad,"" it just doesn't feel flagship enough to compete with Apple and Android's best. Not enough processing power, not enough resolution, too heavy, gets quite hot when playing games etc. All these things conspire against Nokia.That said, if you want a stable alternative to Android/iOS coupled with the absolute best low-light camera on any phone out there, you may just find the Lumia 928 is the phone you. Just make sure the apps you want are there before you make the jump.3 stars out of 5.","June 28, 2013",

mobile phone,"928 has some issues, Verizon's service is bad",Rajiv Mehra,R3DWOXD2W02YPX,3,"After waiting for months, I was very excited about the launch of the Lumia 928. I got this phone on the day of launch at noon time. The Verizon store told me we were the 5th buyer. I bought two, one for me and any wife. I was switching from AT&T.;I know this will irk off some people because they will say the phone is good and I am rating the service...please note these phones are essentially married to Verizon. Unless I buy it at full price and then use it with AT&T...; it will unusable for me. IMHO the phone and service go hand in hand.Lumia 928:-----------The phone is very, very good. It is very fast. The UI is fluid and a joy to use. No lag or sluggish behavior like I notice in Android devices, especially noticeable on Android on the very first swipe to left of right (after the phone has been sitting). I was surprised how much faster apps open compared to my old Samsung Focus Windows phone. Screen size is very nice. The weight is just right. The shape is better than the HTC 8X, whose sharp edges digs into your fingers.Most of the apps I need are all there. Some banks' apps are missing but you can easily use their WAP website instead. For others like Disney, well you can only hope they release a Windows Phone version soon.It does however have a few problems; none of them are deal killers. I am known to be picky:1. The AMOLED screen changes color if you tilt the screen. Dead on the screen is nice, you tilt is a little to the left or right, it becomes bluish. I compared it with my old Samsung Focus...that also has an AMOLED screen, which does not do the same thing. It may not bother you but it bothered me. It was very obvious in screens where the background is white, like while reading e-mail or web pages. Viewing photos also shows the bluish tinge and while it may not matter to the person holding the phone but if you are showing photos to a couple of people standing beside you....well you get the idea.1.1: AMOLED cannot be dimmed easily.Now this is a serious flaw of this technology. I did not realize until I got a Lumia 920 with a regular IPS LCD display. If you like to read in bed, you will like the non AMOLED screens better. The brightness of a AMOLED screen does not do down a lot. So in a totally dark room, it will still be way too bright to be comfortably read. I searched and found that the inability to dim properly is a hallmark of AMOLED screens. My old Samsung Focus with a AMOLED also used to do the same thing.BTW, in almost all other respects, the AMOLED is better.2. The camera button has no middle stop. Lumia 920 has a clearly felt ""half press"" to focus stop. You push down a little and the camera focuses, gives a ""ting"" sound....then you press it fully to take a picture. 928 does have that feature but the hardware button does not have a clearly felt half press. This results in out of focus pics (sometimes).3. The flash is useless. The highly touted flash results in pictures which are too yellow. At first, the white balance seems to be very off. But if you look closely the foreground is properly white balanced but the background is not...it comes out to be very yellow. Maybe the flash ""drops off"" very quickly? To be fair, you can turn off the flash and the pics come out fine. The 920 does not have this problem. I hope a software update will fix this issue.4. Bluetooth issues.a. Phone behaves strangely with music playback. For example, suppose you were listening to Pandora music in the morning and you stopped playback. Then in the afternoon a call comes in, you take that call. After the call ends, the music starts playing again! I did not play music, so why does the phone play music? Even weird is that at that time I cannot find Pandora running in the background (by keeping the back button held down)! The only way to stop Pandora at that time is to start Pandora again from the apps list, then stop it. Same thing happens if you use something other than Pandora, like the phone's own native application for music. None of my other phones do this.b. It starts playing music when it loses BT connection. For example, you have it paired to your car and listening to music. When you end your journey, you stop the music (actually pause) then get down from the car and walk away. Eventually you will be far enough from the car to lose the BT connection (or the car's BT will switch off). At that time the 928 will suddenly start playing music from its own speakers. None of my other phones do this.c. It drops connection with my Plantronics Voyager Legend. About one or twice a day the BT connection drops, sometimes in the middle of a call. This could be the fault of the Voyager also.d. While paired to the headset, you dial a number using the keypad, the sound sometimes starts coming from the phone. To switch to the BT headset, you have to press the BT button on the call screen...very annoying. Note that this problem does not happen all the time.e. To be fair, I hear that the Nokia 920 also has some of these BT issues. So maybe it is a Windows OS problem? But how come my older Windows 7.8 does not have this problem.Verizon:------------1. Verizon's coverage was much worse than AT&T.;I was getting only one bar at home (Woodbridge, VA) and none at work (in downtown DC). In comparison, I get 5 bars and 3 bars with AT&T;, respectively. Maybe AT&T;'s signal penetrates building more easily? They say Verizon's coverage is the best but that was not the case in my experience. Having no connection at work was a deal breaker.2. Voice quality of Verizon is significantly worse than AT&T.;I was surprised how bad it sounded. Even the ringer sounds bad. It sounds like a very low bitrate MP3. People sound garbled inside my home, where I get only one bar. I was having difficulty understanding what the other person is saying. When I dialed 611 to complain to their customer service, I had to tell the rep to repeat again and again...I simply could not understand what she was saying. To be fair, none of the people I called said that they were having any trouble...so it was only on my side. At first I thought it was the lumia 928 but I went to their store and made a couple of calls using Android devices, the sound quality seemed to be the same. I am sure I am being nit-picky here. I am an audiophile at heart. But why does AT&T; sound so much better? I googled and noticed many people saying the same thing, most of them saying Verizon's antique CDMA network is to blame.As a result of having service problems I have returned the phones and have been hit with a $140 fee. $35 activation fee + $35 restocking fee on each of our two phones. I am fighting for these fees with Verizon.I have ported my numbers back to AT&T;, voice quality is again clear, like a land line.I would advise anyone switching carriers to:A) Thoroughly test the device in the first 2 daysB) Find a seller with no restocking fee (e.g. Costco)C) Return it within first 3 days to avoid no refund of the activation fee.","May 26, 2013",

mobile phone,"Good Phone, Poor Support","Bud Porter-Roth ""budpr""",ROIFFYHVN5G6K,3,"I purchased a Nokia 928 two weeks ago. I have a POP 3 email account that I connect to. I have 2 email accounts that I check. I check email on 2 laptops, 1 tablet, 1 phone. I found after a week that the Nokia 928 was deleting the emails from the server and that I could not get those emails on my other devices once deleted on the server. (My 3 year old HTC Droid did not do this) I called Verizon service who did not understand the problem and started reading to me from the manual, which I had and read prior to calling. I told him I had already read that and did he have a secondary source of reference. He said no and determined that the problem was with Nokia. He didn't ask any questions or offer to troubleshoot the issue. Instead, he gave me Nokia's number and didn't offer to guide me or stay with me or asked me to get back to him - sort of like, ""It's not my problem, see you later."" Excellent support Verizon and excellent support training. BTW, the Nokia 928 is Verizon's flagship product. You would think they would be more interested.I called Nokia who listened, didn't understand the problem, and said it was not their problem and sent me to Microsoft. Again, Nokia expressed no interest in my problem or the fact that I was having a problem and no questions about the issue. Nokia gave me Microsoft's number, which as it turns out is a general support desk number for Windows 8. I had to go through two transfers to get to the right group.Microsoft listened and said it was not their problem and sent me back to Nokia. I said no, it was a software problem and Nokia said they didn't make the software. I went through the problem again and the person didn't try to ask me questions or do any other troubleshooting. I was sent to another phone support number in Microsoft that turned out to be ""Supplemental Parts"" support and the guy said sorry he couldn't help me, didn't know why I was sent to that number, and didn't know who I should call.It appears that Verizon can't technically support the Nokia 928 and faced with a support issue it doesn't understand, it blamed Nokia without actually knowing it was or was not. As the primary support for its products, I would expect Verizon to take charge of the problem and get back to me with a solution instead of making me responsible. I'm not sure that Nokia or Microsoft are responsible for direct support to a customer for a Verizon product but I expected more from them in terms of analysis or troubleshooting. Not one of the three companies offered any real support that one would expect.This all took about 45 minutes of me having to make the calls and get shuttled back and forth. I finally called Verizon back and said I want my old phone back, which they did. I am very disappointed in the whole support experience and expected much more. It seems that for Verizon, Nokia, and Microsoft that support is not a critical element in the customer lifecycle and if you have one or two disappointed customers, it is cheaper than offering real support staffing.","May 30, 2013",

mobile phone,So close - but it drops the chalupa,Russell Weisfield,R2OZWXRPRI2M6I,3,"The Lumia 928 seems to epitomize the saying of being close but no cigar. There are a lot of good things in the phone that are more than praiseworthy. Yet there are also just enough misses to make it tough to live on a platform with little traction.First, the UI is sweet! There really isn't a better interface on the other platforms. Microsoft should be given accolades for finding the right mix of form, functionality, and customization. The lack of color options, however, is a detraction as the monochrome nature of the interface can cause eye strain. Additionally, although Bluetooth is available, MS has restricted the use of some devices such as keyboards. Granted the virtual keyboard is fabulous, but sometimes one just wants a proper tactile keyboard. This is one of those moments where the phone gets close, but not quite. Its got Bluetooth, but not the way it should.Similarly, the ""gloved mode"" of the touchscreen was a major selling point. Alas, by glove they mean something such as a batting glove. Winter and decent leather gloves won't work. NFC is available on the phone, but you cannot transfer files to Android devices which are far more prominent than other Windows phones. The often mentioned Kids Corner works - but is not the separate login you might think. Also advertised is that the phone comes with free music services. Indeed, both Nokia Music and Pandora are free. Pandora, however, is free only until the end of the year and the Nokia Music is no better than other services - unless you pay for the premium version.Another big selling point is the camera. This was the biggest letdown. While good for a smartphone, the depth of the pictures taken paled in comparison to the iPhone and Galaxy. The Lumia also added a bluish tint to the pictures. Nothing horrendous but certainly something distracting. Admittedly, the low light pictures were better than on other smartphones but worse than on many point and shoot or slr cameras. The Panorama mode also was somewhat frustrating as you have to match each shot with a little circle that appears. If as you're moving the camera becomes uncertain where you are, then you have to start that shot again. This can cause a panorama shot to take a few minutes to successfully shoot. Admittedly, having the ""lens"" options is a very cool feature that other OSs should emulate. Especially since there are relatively few useful lenses on the Windows ecosystem.As for the more standard functions, such as outgoing and incoming calls, the Lumia failed here. For some reason the phone would have a tendency to make the call fade in and out or add static. Someone suggested it has to do with the placement of the attena in the phone. When the static or fading didn't happen the call was relatively clear with people on the other end remarking that I was as clear as if I were on a landline. Its nice that WP8 offers caller announce. Its unfortunate, however, that there is no notification center and there won't be one until at least sometime in 2014.Browsing the web was fast with the compression that IE10 offers. Some sites, however, still don't render perfectly (whether you choose mobile or desktop version) and trying to close popups or jquery windows can become bothersome if not outright impossible. This, however, might also have been related to the problem of the touchscreen sometimes being just slightly off and having to press above the desired point rather than directly on it. It would, however, be prudent for IE to have a forward button. The data sense provided by Verizon is something that should be emulate$ every carrier on every OS.Music playback through the headphones was exceptionally clear though lacking on the speaker. Windows Phone, however, does have a problem playing aac or wav files. The speech system offerred by Microsoft is pretty good at identifying what was said by the user, although not so good at actually doing what was asked. In other words, when you record a note, it will be reasonably (not perfectly) accurate in what you say (and even keep a copy of your voice with the text). If you give it a command, however, don't expect it to actually do what you ask. Mostly that is because of the paltry number of command. This will likely improve as more apps make use of the speech functions (currently many apps skip that functionality).The apps, of course, are perhaps the biggest thing hurting Windows Phones right now. True, Nokia's mapping applications are the best out there (shows speed, can eliminate tolls/highways/etc. from your trip), Skype is fully integrated, and there is even Microsoft Office. There is, however, a very long list of missing apps. Even the ones that are present are subpar or costlier when compared to their counterparts on IOS and Droid. Many don't integrate Live Tiles. Even the ones that do, have a tendency to freeze, rendering the app to be little more than an icon on the alphabetized app list. To have a chance at unfreezing it you either have to do a hard re-boot or uninstall/reinstall. The Live Tiles and Voice integration could slay the apps on IOS - but only if companies are willing to develop them for the approximately 3% of global smartphone users with a Windows Phone.Ultimately, this is a phone with so much potential. It feels great to hold and can do many things. Its too bad that many of those things just come up a tad short.","July 26, 2013",
mobile phone,I've had worse,T. Radcliffe,R2E8RPR7OYOTYQ,3,"The windows phone is new to me. The operating system appears to work well and the phone itself is very responsive and quick. It's easy to get use to the new layout as opposed to the Android that I'm use to. The only thing I don't like is that the phone is so symmetrical that you just can't tell which end is up by feel. You have to be looking at it and there must be light, because you need to be able to see the buttons on the side. It doesn't help that the buttons are the exact shade of black as the rest of the phone. I wish the buttons were white. Also the buttons are poorly placed so that you almost can't help but to press one just by holding the phone. Also, the phone is hard to hang onto. It's like a bar of soap. A little forethought could have gone a long way with this design. It would be a lot better if it were squared off and if it had something to distinguish the top from the bottom.","November 25, 2013",
mobile phone,"Great Phone, Qustionable Hardware",Matthew F,R1HYKNMHD7AVTL,3,"Overall I love my Lumia 928. The UI is clean, smooth and easy to customize. The app store is constantly being updated, while it is lacking some of the more popular social apps, it has most business/ productive apps that one might need available. Normally I hate most auto corrects, but the auto correct for this phone is very smart and is even able to 'learn' what you type most often, and can even guess (generally very closely) the rest of a sentence you are typing.The one flaw with this phone is that there is a known defect that silences the person calling you. Things like blue tooth and speaker phone will still work, you just can't hold the phone up to your ear. This is an acknowledge defect and if you bring your phone in, you will be issued a like new refurbished phone for free.All in all I love this phone, but just know that the ear speaker may give out.","September 30, 2013",

Screen is beautiful. No lags. Easy to operate. Really had no complaints. LOVED it. Then while using it, with still 1/2 battery charge left, it DIED. Would not power back on. Would not charge. Took it to a Verizon store and they tried a new battery and a power pack and verified that it was, indeed, dead. I had to return the phone to Amazon. Fortunately, Verizon was able to reactivate my old phone. I got my refund from Amazon very quickly but I'm still waiting for the contract to be cancelled so I can order a new phone (I'm not going to go through Amazon this time). I'm not sure if there is a problem with this phone, Amazon's phone program, or if I just happened to get a dud.

mobile phone,Unusable outside,Charles Hallback,RIQIDPI6ZOQGH,3,"Read tons of reviews, what most don't say is how unusable this is outside, it's barely viewable in the shade and not at all usable in direct sunlight. Compared it to my 3 year old ipod touch 4, and the ipod is far more usable outside.A couple of irritants: Used as a music player, keep getting this irritating popup warning when trying to turn the volume up about it being dangerous, with no way to turn warning off permanently. Makes for a bad experience when your trying to walk,run, bike, etc, and you have to pull the phone out of your pocket to see why the volume won't go up, and of course if you're outside, you can't see the screen. Come on Samsung, not all headphones have the same efficiencies. People have been bith*n about this for years.Like most phones and iPods, the equalizer app only works with the built in music player, not with any third party music apps.Caching with Slacker radio plus doesn't seem to work right on this phone, it keeps stopping.Camera takes great pictures, but you can't see the screen to click on the icon to take a picture/video outside.","July 22, 2013",

mobile phone,"useless features, but nice big screen size.",Hoon Ik Cho,RSM7O7URP21U,3,"If you people have a choice, go for the Google Play edition(Yes I know that you can install custom rom). For Verizon I know that there isn't a Google Play edition S4, but if you have a choice to go for T-mo or AT&T; and MUST use Galaxy S4, then buy the Play edition. Not that I'm saying the Verizon's coverage service is bad or anything, but with all the bloatwares pre-installed and the good 'ol horrible Touch-Wiz(yeah it did improve a LOT compared to older versions).I think all that eye gesture features are just useless... I mean it's really cool for the first few weeks but after that, those features just don't come all that handy in real life situation. If there was one gesture feature that I ACTUALLY used in real life, that's probably the wave above the phone to answer the phone call in speaker phone. Besides that, I don't remember other features being useful at all.

Colors are vibrant and clear(some don't like thie but I like super colorful displays). and the Full-HD resolution on this device makes the texts really good looking.Screen size... was a bit awkward in my opinion. I do like the big size, but I wish it was just either bigger, or smaller(I'd much prefer the S3's screen size.).

mobile phone,"Great device, but terrible phone",Jay89ls6,R2Q45KID31948C,3,"I will agree that all the pros of the s4 are true i.e. great screen, camera, light weight,great processor, good battery life mine has not gone below 50% since I've had it, but for me I am very picky and I dislike the UI of this phone. The previous phone I had was an HTC so things on that phone I liked and some I hated.1. On the S4 I hate how when I press the icon to make a call it will always take me to the keypad, which to me would be fine if it showed recent calls above it where there is currently an empty white space. The HTC phone did exactly what I wanted, showed the keypad and recent calls when the same icon was pressed. I am trying to get in the habit of using the speed dial feature and Google now because if I start typing the name of someone I want to call, it will display information from one person in my contacts and a drop box next to that info when clicked will reveal the other numerous contacts (sometimes 25) I might be trying to call. This is terrible because I feel it should be predictive and remember which numbers are called more frequently and take those up to the top of the list. To Samsung's credit though I like their tab called favorites. It displays frequently contacted contacts. If the phone were able to let me choose which tab was opened when the phone icon was clicked, I would choose favorites, but as far as I know the UI won't let me. It always comes up with the keypad and a blank space above it.2. I dislike the preloaded widgets and lock screens. The clock widgets won't let me click on them to view or modify any alarms unless I choose the widget called alarm(stupid widget which only displays which days one of my alarms is set for and the time it will go off). I was able to find an app called ""easy clock widget"". This app allows me to modify my alarms, activate the stopwatch, and start a timer. I miss being able to have the four customizable icons/apps on the lock screen. With the S4 I'm stuck with a clock and a customizable message I can add.3. The calendar widget does not allow me to swipe up and down in order to view a different month, so it makes me click on small icons in the upper corners.This link here http://youtu.be/RHIXtw34wK4 points out some other weak points about the s4 which would take me quite some time to explain on here. I decided to share my dislikes because most people have not pointed them out. In reality all the complaints I have regarding the phone can be fixed in a software update, but I feel it would be more likely they are fixed on their next galaxy s phone they come out with. I've used the note 2 and for some reason I remember having a better UI and was just more well thought out. To me it seems this phone was just rushed out. The S4 has some new features which are not available on other smartphones yet, but when it comes to the basics, the S4 isn't so good. So it is a great device, but not a great phone at least for me.","June 28, 2013",

mobile phone,Not as amazing as everyone says.,"Amazon Customer ""Signatures are onerous.""",R2OCPYGFH05G0A,3,"I ""upgraded"" to a Galaxy S4 from an Iphone 4. So far I wish I had gotten an Iphone 5. The large screen on the Galaxy S4 is nice, but what they don't tell you is that you pay a huge price in battery life. Even with the screen brightness turned almost all the way down and all unnecessary apps closed, the battery doesn't even last me a full day. And it's not like I watch videos and listen to music all day. Compared to the performance of the Iphone's battery, the GS4's blows. Also, texting on the GS4 is not as smooth as it is on the Iphone. When you use a symbol or punctuation mark (yes, some of us actually do use proper punctuation), the virtual keyboard should automatically revert back to the regular letter keyboard, as it does on the Iphone, because a punctuation mark is almost always followed by a letter. The fact that the GS4's virtual keyboard does not do this requires an extra press of the shift key, which is a big pain in the butt because it is constantly interrupting the flow of your texting. Also, the GS4 does not have a good selection of text and ring tones. They're all too quiet.Another problem I've noticed with the GS4 is the internet browser is glitchy and prone to freezing. I've had to reload pages many times because the page I was on went dead. Other disadvantages: the model that comes with the Verizon deal has only 16 gigs of storage. If you want more, you have to pay 30 to 50 dollars for an SD card. Another big negative is that there is no equalizer function for fine-tuning the sound of your music. All you can do is adjust the volume. One other thing that is very annoying is that every time someone sends me a text, I also get an email of that text. I've searched everywhere in my phone and have found no way to turn that ridiculous option off.I realize I haven't become completely familiar with all the features of my GS4 yet, but from what I've seen so far I think I'll be going back to the Iphone.","September 27, 2013",

mobile phone,A lot of hype,"G. Camel ""That Camel""",R1LTHKFSBGF7F5,3,"THe SG4 is a good phone, but it comes with a lot of extra frills that you could live without. It's like whipped cream on hot coco it just makes a mess. This was my first attempt at a Sammy made phone and I really looked forwarded to trying ""the best"" and after about a week of use I have a lot of issues that bother me. The screen looks Nice. I like the pop-out feature for my movies, too bad it doesn't' pop-out for yahoo, etc. I can't find the zoom for the camera. The button to open Google Now brings up the keyboard at the same time and it gets in the way. I thought the Sammy's App store, media hub and Story Album were a bit intrusive. The Story Album runs in the background collecting your pics into an album that Samsung will publish for you for a cost. WHAT happen to the WiFi toggle button?!The Contacts displayed is customizable. This Sammy like Sammies in the past give the option to block certain numbers. Too bad I can restrict calls on to folks in my contact . I like the fact like the IPhone most, many accessories will work with a Sammy. The Watch On app was nice, but with AT&T; u-verse the app mostly recommends the HDTV channels and not the standard def.","June 21, 2013",
mobile phone,Galaxy sucks,Presley,R3RQKXNFDEILMH,3,"I switched from an iPhone 4 to a galaxy s4 because my iPhone broke and I needed an upgrade that day. My mom had the s3 and I thought it was cool. You can customize your screens and home screen. I really like a lot of the features but it is hard to find things and confusing to use if you are used to iPhones or other phones that are not androids. I really love the camera on this phone as it takes amazing pictures and you can take so many different kinds like panoramics, etc. My galaxy kept freezing though and acting strange and I had to take the battery out constantly to restart it which took awhile. I do not like the music apps with it either and it's hard to figure out how to shuffle songs or make playlists. If you get a workout armband, the volume is so sensitive that it will automatically go to full blast in your earphones and it sucks! I ordered a replacement after only having mine for 2-3 weeks because of these problems. The battery also sucks and would drain so fast! I had to charge a few times a day! I would charge my battery all night and go to work and not even play on it or touch it and it would be almost dead when I took it out on my lunch break. I would not recommend switching from an iPhone to the galaxy if you are used to iPhones. They shipped me another galaxy and as soon as I turned it on, it froze! I finally took that one back as well and got another iPhone.","November 19, 2013",

PROS: SCREEN SIZE AND 13MP CAMERA AND THATS ABOUT IT. SCREEN IS HUGE BUT ALMOST TOO BIG, HARDER TO HANDLE AND LOOKS GOOFY WHEN HOLDING UP TO YOUR EAR TO TALK. POOR BUTTON PLACEMENT MAKES YOU HIT THE VOLUME KEYS EVERY TIME U WANT TO TURN THE SCREEN OFF THEN WON'T LET U LOCK THE VOLUME SETTINGS. EVERY TIME YOU PLUG IN HEADPHONES JACK VOLUME IS SWITCHED DOWN AUTOMATICALLY THEN U GET A WARNING NAG SCREEN ABOUT LISTENING AT HIGH LEVEL -BS.

mobile phone,"Great specs, but a few issues.",Nicole,R3CBFF9W46LHEP,3,"Slick phone that came with all the fixings (screen protector, car charger, and protective case) and great specs at a reasonable price point. Runs quick and smooth with very few glitches. Pandora lock screen can glitch out, bluetooth connected well to most my devices, some issue with some version 1 bluetooth headphones, but anything 2.0 and later was fine. Compared to my Galaxy the Play doesn't pick up as strong of a signal on t-Mobile. Didn't see the claimed 42mbps data speeds but in all fairness t-Mobile has always given me issues with data. Biggest issue was I bought the Life Play and the battery will last 8 hours only if it spends most of the time in standby mode or use it hard for a 2 hours then have to kill all apps and plug it in. Blu customer service was no help, blamed apps, said ""phone needs 10 min. rest with battery removed DAILY"", who does this?

Although the back cover is flimsy, the gel cover that comes with it, is perfect for correcting this issue and protecting the device. Set up was easy, although the user manual is very light on details or specifications and most of the info i had to search for online. The bad: by far the worst part of this phone is the battery life. If you use this phone all day, you will need to charge it every 6 hours or so. I tried different battery saving settings and even installed a battery saving app and i'm still having to recharge it some time around mid afternoon. I charge it every night and turn the power off at night. Turn it on around 7am. I use it for work but i am hardly on the phone.

It does have some slag when operating certain apps. I also find that the GPS stops working and when it does it is not correct.. I have tried several blue tooth devices and they will not pair with the phone which is bad cause i use my phone when I drive and don't like holding a phone in my hand.

AN UNLOCKED PHONE SHOULD BE UNLOCKED FOR EVERY CARRIER AND NOT JUST FOR ONE CARRIER, I WOULD CONSIDER IT AS AN ATT PHONE MORE THAN AN UNLOCKED PHONE. ONE LAST THING IS THAT BLU SHOULD HAVE ACCESSORIES AVAILABLE FOR THE PRODUCTS THEY SELL. I'M TAKING ONE STAR FOR THE MISSING BANDS AND ONE FOR NO AVAILABLE ACCESSORIES FROM BLU. PLEASE DO YOUR RESEARCH BEFORE YOU BUY AN ""UNLOCK"" PHONE. T-MOBILE WORKS ON 1700/2100 NATIONWIDE AND WILL USE 1900 TOO, BUT ONLY ON URBAN AREAS.

mobile phone,Kinda of a buyer beware but honestly it's halfway decent,Charles Riley,R1PLLY2AO04OSE,3,"BLU is coming up in the world with this phone but it has a long way to go before it's up to the peak when it comes to good budget phones.Ascetically it's a very pleasing phone, the screen is very bright and pretty vivid. The viewing angles BLU was able to achieve without having to go with an AMOLED screen is great. The design language is great the phone is slim and light not too unwieldy despite it being a larger screen phone.Performance wise, there are very few hiccups as the Quad Core Cortex A7 processor can handle tasks easily, this isn't a chart breaker but this isn't sluggish by any means. However don't expect this phone to be a gamer's delight as you can eat through battery very quickly if you're playing more graphically intensive games. Battery life can be mixed as it doesn't have the greatest power user in mind, but with mixed usage you can get through a day easily and if you're a light user you can probably get the phone to last 2 to 3 days by using the power saver function that BLU has built in.The main reason why this phone doesn't get a high mark from me is that there is a possible defect that users could run into with the Micro-USB port, in that it could get bent and thus make it almost neigh impossible to get the phone to charge and or sync with a computer. I ran into this defect and had to send the phone back to Amazon because of it. Such a shame because it has the potential to be a great phone and value, however I can't fully recommend it because of the defect.","January 17, 2014",

mobile phone,"So Far, So Good - Update",landberry,RN7WPK9ZHJAAZ,3,"I've only had this phone for a few days, but I really like it. It's a very nice looking phone, lightweight, and a clear bright screen. In addition to the usual charger, data cable, and headphones, it came boxed with a screen protector and silicone case. I really love the choice of colors and the price was acceptable.I purchased this when my Samsung Galaxy Skyrocket started freezing several times a day, after only a year. Samsung is my brand of choice, so to go with an unknown brand called BLU was a real gamble.My only problem with the phone had to do with being unable to access my AT&T; data package when WiFi was unavailable. Two lengthy calls to ATT's tech support and a visit to the store were not helpful. The store staff said they had never heard of BLU and suggested that I needed to return the phone to Amazon.My last resort was to search online to see if others had the same issue. I found several postings that provided the APN settings for my service provider. I tried them and WOW!! I'm now up and running. So now, the wait to see how things go with my pink BLU Life Play has begun. I'll update this review as needed, but for now I'm giving it four stars.Update 8/20/13--- Discovered that pictures sent via email wouldn't download. Did another search online and found others who provided settings that worked! Callers notified me that my voice mail was not personalized. Will try to find a solution and report back. Even with these issues I still like this phone.Update 9/29/13--- I still like this phone and it is working fine. I figured out how to record my personal voice mail greeting since my last update. My only complaint right now is that the WLAN does not automatically stay on.Update 1/24/14--- I still like the phone but a little less. The internal phone storage is small and will not accommodate many of my apps. Although I have a nice sized SD card, the phone requires many of my apps to be stored internally and will not go on the SD card. When my apps are updated, I constantly get an insufficient storage space message. Setting the phone to automatically download to the SD card won't work.Perhaps all phones have this issue, so my 4 star rating remains. The BLU tech people were very helpful in explaining my problem.I may need to consider another phone when time for my AT&T; upgrade, but this will make me unhappy. I think the BLU phones are a great alternative to the pricier name brand phones.Update 2/18/14--- Having MAJOR problems with the updating of apps. The phone prompts me that my apps need to be updated. When I click on update, I keep getting error messages saying there is insufficient space on the device for each application. The majority of these apps are actually on the 32 SD card, so I'm not sure what is happening. For those apps I really want to be updated, I end up deleting other apps to try to clear space.It's become a nuisance, so when my AT&T; upgrade is available in the next couple of months, I will be getting a different phone. I am disappointed because I really loved this phone. Perhaps it's just my particular phone or me. I still think this is a good buy for someone who does not use this phone as their lifeline or need a lot of applications. For the reason stated above, I have lowered my rating to three stars.","August 13, 2013",

mobile phone,gave my daughter a phone,Stev,R1MBC8W8TC60RK,3,"boredom is an ugly thing.a few weeks ago, while bored, i was trolling through amazon looking for an prepaid android phone to play with. the only ones i could find for cheap ran an ancient version, so i wasnâ€™t really interested. but i did run across a nokia 520 att phone for 50$. this, as it turns out, is currently the most popular windows phone. i decided to give it a shot.so, it arrives. i open the package, and find that not only is it a pay as you go phone, it is an assemble as you go phone. the battery, sim card, and back case all need to be added. i decided that i didnâ€™t want to deal with the phone part now, so i just installed the battery, and put on the back of the case, and turned it on.sure, it whined to me about the missing sim card, but seemed willing to continue. it booted up, and told me that it needed to finish installing itself. wow. the iPhones i have been getting do something like this too, but this took me back to the last time i installed windows.now the interface during this point is very old school windows. black background, white square outline buttons, but interestingly, no windows, just messages and buttons floating at the top of the screen. it foozles around for a few minutes, and then tells me it needs to finish, and it just sits there.it sits there for 5 minutes. not obviously doing anything. at this point, i assume it is upset because the sim card is missing, and it doesnâ€™t know what to do. i turn the phone off, open the back, remove the battery, and install the sim card, and put it back together. i turn it on, and the windows phone tile interface appears.now the interface is interesting. you are presented a screen with tiles all over it. there are two sizes of square tiles, small and large, where large is the same space as a square of 4 smalls, and the gaps between the tiles. you can delete tiles, and the interface leaves the space blank, until there is blank space all the way across. when this happens the interface squeezes out the blank row. you can scroll up and down through the tiles. if you canâ€™t find what you want, you can push the tiles to the left, and get a list of all the applications on the phone, consisting of smaller tiles with a name printed next to them. this list you cannot edit, and includes all the crap that both nokia and att added to the phone.for the first day, the phone behaved oddly. items in the system menu did not seem to work, taking me to a blank screen, and then dumping me back. there was no way to find out various things about the phone, like the IMEI number, or even the option of finding the phoneâ€™s phone number.some of the nokia apps didnâ€™t work since i didnâ€™t have a nokia account. the nokia maps app would not work because i was not willing to let it use my current location.the app store needs an email account, and seems biased for a MS Live account. i decided to go ahead and get one, since i didnâ€™t want to use my other email addresses here anyway. now, Live wonâ€™t give you an email account unless you already have an email account. they maintain it is so that they can email you if the account becomes compromised. i suppose it never occurred to them that i might not have another email account. so, after thrashing around for a bit, i decided to try and create a hotmail account. as it turns out, i guess hotmail accounts donâ€™t get compromised, since they didnâ€™t require another email address. i gave the new hotmail account to Live as my second email address, and it was fine with it.amusingly enough, when i entered them into the email application on the phone, it coalesced them into one account. with the Live email address. at first i thought that i had screwed it up, but when i tried to add the hotmail address again, it told me that was already there, even though i donâ€™t seem to be able to access it.aaaannnnyyyyyway, this allowed me to log into the windows app store. the app store is interesting in that it sort of follows a combination of the tiles interface and the list interface in a confusing jumble. i never figured out how to search the store. i did, however, find minesweeper, the one thing i really miss from windows. since it was free, i purchased it, and it started to download. i also purchased preview copies of one or two other games. they were all downloading.three hours later, they had not finished, not one of them. the system app told me that while the system had take up about 5 gig of the 8 on my phone, the rest was empty.the next morning, still without minesweeper, i played around some more. one thing that was available in the system app was the opportunity to return the phone to factory settings. i gave it a shot. i plugged it in, and hit the reset. when it got to the screen telling me that there was more configuring to, i walked away, and came back about 10 minutes later. it was still right there, with nothing to tell me that it wasnâ€™t hung, but i just walked away again. an hour later, when i came back, it showed me the tile interface.the system application had about â…“ more options, including the ones i was interested in. the mail app loaded my two email addresses, and the store app downloaded my three games quickly without issue.clearly, i had f***ed the phone over turning it off to put the sim card in. clearly, that is my fault. i will also compliment the windows team that a broken installation worked as well as it did. i do find fault, however, that an install could fail to complete and not be noticed when it rebooted. clearly, there were substantial pieces missing, and there was no error reporting to the user about it. there was also no feedback that something was happening during the install. if it is going to sit there blankly for 30 seconds, i suppose i can understand that. if it is going to take more than 10 minutes, it should provide some useful feedback.first, the hardware:pluses:the phone feels crisp and fast, and the screen is bright and sharp.the phone vibrates for a fraction of a second to let you know that it read your touch of one of the capacitance buttons on the front.minuses:the resolution is not great (while i did buy a cheap phone, it is also their best seller, and this is the introduction people are going to get).all the real buttons are on one side. the power/wake button is between the volume buttons and the camera shutter button. all are the same shape.no forward facing camera.and second the software:the UI is classic microsoft. interesting where they paid attention (the tile interface), and cluttered and inconsistent where they didnâ€™t (like the system application). rather than buy into the tile interface completely, they include a listing of the applications on the side just a swipe away. the screen includes a capacitance â€œbackâ€ button, which behaves inconsistently, sometimes moving you backwards inside the application, and sometimes backwards through the applications, depending where you start. if you are in email, the button will run you up levels until you reach the top, and then jump you back to the tile interface. if you are in internet explorer, it will just go back through web pages, including pages from previous sessions. there is a button of stacked lines that appears in a lot of applications. unfortunately, it not only means different things between applications, it sometimes means different things inside the same application, depending on where you are. some messages are presented by darkening the screen, and floating some white text near the top, with one of those classic square white outline buttons to press.if this was the way the iPhone looked when it was released, it would have gone nowhere. microsoft has something interesting here, but they need to forget the desktop for a moment and give a raging a***ole with a vision and an OCD complex the power to fix it and make it consistent and usable.in the end, i bought a 25$ go phone card. by enabling the phone on their web site, and using the phone card, i was able to enable the phone with 250 minutes of talk, and unlimited text, for 25$ per month. no data is included, but i donâ€™t care. i am under the impression that since it is now set up like that, i can add it to my att account as a feature phone, for 10$ per month, again with no data.i gave it to my middle daughter, since it is everything she wanted: something different from what i had.","February 9, 2014",
mobile phone,Great phone for the price!!!! Plenty of power... Terrible camera....,PR,R1EEWSMXTOWAE9,3,"This is a great phone if you need something cheap but loaded with features. Here are the things I like:PROS:1. It's fast and fluid. It just works.2. It's cheap! Can't beat the price3. The screen is nice and the feel of the phone is great.4. It has an offline GPS mode (but there is a slight problem with this...see CONS section)CONS:1. The GPS is only free for local use. If you try using the offline free GPS in another country it will ask you to pay for a licensing fee. That's what happened to me when crossing back and forth from Canada and the USA.2. There is no led light or camera flash on this device. Makes it useless to shoot pictures with at night.3. The keyboard is CRAP! It is seriously terrible... I find that many users like myself end up hitting the comma button repeatedly instead of the space bar. I swear I'm pressing the space bar, but the comma always registers. Also the accuracy of the keyboard is terrible. It makes for an unpleasant experience at times..... I'm not the only one with this issue, as several of my friends have the same problem.Conclusion:Overall, although there are many shortcomings with this phone, it is still good considering the price. I don't think you'd be disappointed with it considering what you get for for the price. But, don't expect perfection, as this phone does fall short in many aspects.","May 7, 2014",

Touchscreen is good; Camera is okay; The 'Here' map is really good... and so is the GPS that you can access offline.But the battery is the major disappointment for me. Its not even lasting more than a day if even for default apps running with wifi on. I dont know what will happen if I install new apps. If I turn off wifi, then the battery life lasts little over a day. Only option to make the battery last for couple days is to turn off Wifi and switch on the 'not recommended' battery saver mode !!

The First Lumia 520 i had the Audio jack or head phone jack messed up so i sent it back to get a new one. ok no problem. Now the new one i have for some weird reason shuts off the display and doesnt let me see the screen for no apparent reason which makes it very annoying when getting texts i cant see, and it also appears that my battery life is somewhat dwindling. Another problem i have is the level of apps this phone can have which is not much.

mobile phone,"solid 3 star performance, 4 star value...",jasper pipestone,R6N6NZ729IJ0Q,3,"I needed an additional Ipod like device and found the Nokia 520 on sale, bought it, searched twitter for info/experiences on it the next morning and saw it went on crazy sale, canceled original and bought for $20 less. So because I have so little invested into it compared to my old Ipod touch I think it's great for most my purposes.Plus side: decent GPS navigation (pretty up to date POI) but touchy when searching for exact names (H-E-B not HEB; that sort of thing), has micro SD slot for Music/Photos so you get as much of the 8GB to put on apps, pictures look pretty good considering no flash (nice multi shot modes in the Nokia software that allows you to choose a shot to keep).Weird side: I don't get the Windows app store's vendors-seems like they are all guys that are creating site launchers (walmart for example) so Windows phones don't seem very supported by the normal vendors (won't have your local banks app), the vertical tiles orientation is annoying (find my self moving apps around to group them in bundles of similar apps on the long scroll down page like going back to some sort of ""links I like"" list from 1997, can't use as a wifi adapter for a PC at home that doesn't have wifi, The cloud backup doesn't give me much confidence (be nice if there was a Nokia suite for back ups, personalizing, organizing apps etc for a wide range of operating systems).Since all I wanted was the GPS, expandable memory for music, and some web browsing its great for the price. If I was going to have to deal with the Nokia 520 as a smartphone I was more attached to I'd go with a cheap used Android to get more common apps and wifi tethering. Maybe if you have windows 8 on a computer to sync with it's a better experience.","January 28, 2014",
mobile phone,Basic Smartphone,K. brann,R3DUVEVLZBJ6TM,3,"If you need a phone for texting, internet, email, and facebook (social media apps) the Nokia 520 is more than adequate. Windows phone 8 is fine as long as you not an app-aholic. I purchased this phone to replace a defective Samsung android phone and just put in my current contract sim card (AT&T;) and everything works fine. I will say that there are 2 important limitations. First, there is no flash for the camera. Not really a big deal unless you really dig taking lots of photos with your phone or want to use it as a flash light. The second limitation is with playing music on WP8. It is absolutely stupid how difficult it is to make a playlist on this OS. If you want to make a custom playlist, you basically have to do it by connecting to your pc. Hello Microsoft??? This really needs to get fixed. As far as the hardware goes, the phone seems well made for the money and I have no complaints with Nokia.Bottom line...if you can live without a flash for the camera and the pain in the a** it is to make a music playlist, then this phone is a good value.","January 28, 2014",
mobile phone,Great for the SHORT TERM - Temporary/Replacement Phone,"Simba ""chris""",R3TMG845RZ3H7O,3,"I bought this phone after my iPhone 5 broke. My contract didn't allow for an upgrade for another year, so I decided to buy a go phone. I stumbled upon this phone on amazon (as Im sure most of you did). I was quite impressed with its performance initially. After two or three months here is what I have to say about it:If you are buying this phone for the purpose of just using it as a short term replacement (from your lost or broken ""nice"" smartphone), then you found the right product.HOWEVER BEWARE: I would not recommend buying this phone if you need a reliable phone for longer than a two or three month period. Like many users have stated the hardware isn't the most durable and your main operating buttons for the phone WILL eventually FAIL. My home screen button stopped work after a week; but, this was fine to me because everything else operated seamlessly.. that is until today, one of my volume buttons stopped working. This makes it impossible for me to control my volume. And even under settings the operating system does not allow you to scroll up or down for sound. So basically I can't play music anymore through bluetooth, can't hear any alerts, or even turn up my alarm. This is a great backup or temporary phone but the quality of the hardware build is not top notch and that should be taken into consideration.P.S. the App store sucks(terrible apps besides Netflix and Spotify), and sure its no galaxy S4 or iPhone5, but for the price, it functions as a great temporary backup phone until your contract allows for a cheap upgrade on your actual smartphone.Summary: As your normal everyday cellphone you plan to use for two years = 2 Stars ** As a temporary or replacement phone = 4 to 5 Stars ****","January 16, 2014",

mobile phone,Don't settle,Rich Ball,R3IOFLOMMPG313,3,"I've been using Windows Phone since Windows Mobile, and the new UI since my HTC Surround when Windows Phone 7 launched. I currently have a Nokia Lumia 925 and an HTC 8X and love both, so when my oldest daughter was ready for a phone this Christmas I thought we'd try a PayGo before settling into a contract.The biggest issue I have with the 520 is the screen resolution, because so many other issues stem from that. For starters, the Windows Phone app marketplace is fairly limited already, but many of the apps were created when Windows Phone had a minimum resolution of 720p (1280x720). The 520 has Windows Phone's new low-end 480p resolution (800x480), which means a good percentage of the already-limited marketplace is closed off to the 520. The was really highlighted when I tried to download apps I had on the other phones to this one and found even old basics like Doodle Jump and Fruit Ninja can't be had on the 520. On top of that, Microsoft never updated the UI fonts when lowering the resolution standards for the manufacturers, so it is a pixelated frustration at times to read emails and web pages. Furthermore the 520 manages to be the only AT&T; Windows Phone without a front-facing camera, which means you can't even use Microsoft's own Skype with it.I had low, but I felt reasonable, expectations for a phone at this price and Nokia still managed to deliver under expectations. If you need a cheap smartphone to text, email, and other basic functions that don't require apps you'll be fine with the 520. By not having apps, it has plenty of space for music, the Bluetooth works excellent, so it works for us as a My First Smartphone to see if she can handle the responsibility (also, Microsoft's Parental Controls work excellently with Windows Phone). I can't imagine it will work well or long for people looking for a more robust experience, especially with the proliferation of higher-resolution PayGo Androids that don't have the very small app marketplace the 520 suffers.","January 8, 2014",
mobile phone,Excellent phone.The price is a bonus,slowdown,R365KAKDVT7LL7,3,"So why only 3 stars? the only reason is AT&T.; Unless you have unlimited data, for the carrier to remove the built in data tracking app is pretty low down. AT&T; has a web based app (that is less than ideal as you use your data to check your data).On the plus side this phone works well on their no data prepaid plans, (would have considered one of their data packages but I have good access to WIFI and I would like to know how much I am actually using as apposed to how much AT&T; says I am using) If you go this route they will try to up sell you, and say that it is policy to sell data packages with smart phones but it works just fine without (multi-media messages work fine once configured)The phone it self is really good. Depending on use I get all day out of it (unplugged 7am plugged in at 9pm). The app store has a wide range and growing number of apps.

mobile phone,Good Phone Especially for a GoPhone,Nokia Lumia User,R1UBVP4RLBQDLZ,3,"I will be fair and preface this by saying I'm typically a devout Samsung and/or Droid Market user; however, when I dropped my latest LG phone (shattering the screen), the Nokia Lumia was an inexpensive and suitable solution. The seller shipped the phone very quickly which was fantastic! Even though I had a micro SIM, I was able to put it in place well enough for it to work which is another plus. I actually like the ""tile"" idea and that it continuously updates my e-mails, messages, weather (etc) so I don't miss anything. Also, the GPS is just as good as any other phone I've had (maybe even better in some cases.) I also like that I don't have to call my voicemail because the name/date/time is listed along with the ability to play back the message like a regular audio recording. What are the downs? The biggest issue I have is that some of the free apps available on other markets (Words with Friends for example) aren't available or you have to pay for them. The graphics and qualities of the apps are pretty basic, too. All in all, I will eventually get a more upgraded phone, but I've got to give credit where it's due, and this phone will always remain my backup in a pinch.","February 28, 2014",

There aren't that many out there (vs Android or Apple), and a good bit of the ones that are there are 3rd party and don't work or aren't supported after the build. The interface for Gmail is terrible! No way to filter out the spam, so I now get a notification for each email that comes in, and I have to delete them manually.2. Why cheap out on the sound/notification profiles? There are none on this phone, so you have to trust a 3rd party app (good luck) or go into the settings to manually change and turn off the ringer and notification tones when you need it to be silent. And if you don't want it to wake you up in the middle of the night, you'd better do it because the phone won't charge without the OS running, which means even if you turn it off before you plug it in, it reboots itself.The phone itself is great, just wish it came with an Android OS instead of Windows.","April 23, 2014",

Do not pick this phone if you like to take photos using the smartphone.2. long wait of ""Resuming..."" screen when switching to another app.3. some hyperlinks are difficult to touch when surfing using the Internet Explorer. Sometimes I thought I touched the hyperlink, but nothing happened or even worse the other link is opened.4. voice volume can not set separately for phone itself and the earphone.5. calendar event reminder cannot set as ""remind me before 5 minute start"". Instead, it is more like a clock alarm setting, as it can only set as something like ""remind me after 5 minutes"". EDIT: I can set ""remind me before ... minutes or hours"" when I create the event or edit the event. But once the reminder is activated, I can only choose ""Snooze for ... minutes""; I cannot set it to ""remind me again before ... minutes"". Maybe I can re-edit the event to set it, but that's an awkward way.6. The search button on the bottom right corner is easy to be touched by mistakes. And there is no way to disable it or rebind it to other apps/functions instead of the seldom used Bing search.7. Awkward way to create a playlist through the phone. I cannot simply select the songs and save to a playlist. Instead I need to add the songs to the ""now playing"" queue first. But the ""now playing"" queue usually has songs which I played previously but do not want to save to the playlist. However, there is no obvious way to clear the queue until I google search the answer - play a single song which I want to save to the playlist and then add the other songs to the ""now playing"" queue.","December 14, 2013",

mobile phone,Good phone if you like Microsoft,Window,R12WFNIKCAZ46O,3,"Essentially, the phone has all the basics, is easy to figure out and does what it is asked. The battery really lasted long, especially since I turned off all the unnecessary apps and did not keep data connected when I didn't need to. The screen is big and clear and pleasant to work with. The images flip sideways when you turn the phone. Unfortunately, I am more concerned with things that disappoint me, such as the quiet alert tones that come with the phone and which cannot be replaced with downloaded ones. One Note, a quick note taking program, requires signing up with a username that stores your notes in a cloud and not on the phone. You can pin each note to the start page, but otherwise, you must store it off the phone. There is no ""delete"" button and you must use the ""Back/Left"" arrow to backtrack, leaving all your paths to be retraced. My biggest beef, however, is that I need browser flexibility which the phone does not have. I need to link quickly from emails to a work website, but the Internet Explorer browser on the phone requires that I sign in with a password on that website every time I link to it. Explorer can be bypassed for other internet browsing, if you download another one that Windows phones will take (not Opera mini), but emails still must use Explorer, so that doesn't help me. Just be prepared when you buy such a phone that you will have to love being a Microsoft and Windows patron.","August 10, 2013",

mobile phone,Beware of Sim Card Size,Bobbie J. Martin,R28TC8ZFACC1TK,3,"The Lumia 520 phone seems to work fine and I think I will enjoy using it. However, if you are a current AT&T; customer and you plan to use your old sim card in this phone, you may have a big problem. The sim card in my previous AT&T; phone is too big for this phone. I called AT&T; and the representative told me to cut my old sim card to match the micro sim card slot for the new phone, and it should work immediately in this Lumia phone. Well guess what? Not only did it not work in the new phone, but now it won't work in the old phone, so I can't even view my contacts to at least copy them to the new phone. I had to go to an AT&T; retail location and all they could do for me was port my phone number to a new sim card so that I could at least use the new phone. I do not know why AT&T; would not clearly indicate that the phone's sim card may not match, instead of saying all we have to do is put our old sim card in the new phone and everything works fine. That is a lie! And unfortunately I lost my contact information as a result. Not too happy right about now.","August 14, 2013",

mobile phone,A great attempt by HTC - but it needs work,Genryu,R31W1WO2JE2KJF,3,"I began following the HTC since it was first getting leaked that HTC was staging a comeback, and the HTC One was going to be their flagship device. I'm someone that always likes to jump on board with the latest and greatest and so I tried out the HTC One shortly after it came out. Despite my initial excitement and some positive aspects to the device and the software, I ultimately ended up returning it. I've tried to highlight the pros and cons below that led to my decision.Pros- Fantastic build quality: This is what an Android phone should be built like and it just feels fantastic to the touch. High quality materials all around - save for a few bands of plastic for the cellular and Wifi radios. Holding this in 1 hand and the SGS4 in the other makes it readily apparent which company went the extra mile to build something that feels solid in the hand.- Excellent screen: The color reproduction is by far the more accurate out of the recent crop of android devices on the market. I regularly use a color-calibration device on my computer monitors, so I pay particular attention to this. The unit I specifically got has a slight red-shift, but nothing that impairs the overall quality. It's definitely got more accurate color reproduction than the Samsung Galaxy S4, but some people might like the ""richer"" more saturated look that the SGS4 provides. Viewing angles are only about okay, but not a big issue for me since I'm the only one that uses this. The 1080p Resolution makes everything crisp and easy to read.- Above-average low-light performance: This phone overall does a better job than most other competitors in terms of low-light performance. I wish I could say it stands above the rest, but Nokia takes top honors in low-light and in terms of mixed lighting scenarios I still think the SGS4 is still a step up. See the cons for more information.- Good camera software: The Zoes feature is pretty cool and is a great way to create little clips or pick out the best image of the lot. It's easy to share and integrates well with existing social networks. It's one of the unique software features HTC offers, and is definitely one of the fun highlights that most people I show really enjoy playing with. I just wish it came with a dedicated camera button to make taking pictures a bit easier.- Great built-in speakers: The speakers that are built into the phone sound pretty solid if you're holding the phone in the standard portrait mode. It's great for sharing something with a friend when you're in a more public area and most phone speakers give out. Don't expect miracles from phone speakers, but as far as phone speakers go they are a step above the rest. The beats software also does some great synthesizer work when you plug in your headphones, though it's more suitable for current pop and hip-hop music than for other genres.- Blinkfeed: Blinkfeed sort of integrates all of the news you care about into one convenient sliding panel. I tried it for a bit, and while it's convenient I also feel it was reducing my battery performance (no evidence of this), so I simply chose to ignore it. It's a great option for those of you that want to pull in information from all of your favorite sites into one area. I don't think there is a way to remove blinkfeed entirely, you can only choose to ignore it like I did. Still work trying out though!- Includes IR integration: This means the HTC can connect and control your TV, which is pretty handy when you can't find the remote. It's pretty basic in terms of the controls you get, but it works well in a pinch.- Solid wifi performance: I have a Asus AC-1750 802.11ac router and tested speeds on file transfers and media playback with the HTC One and it came through with flying colors. I was easily able to transfer a 1080p MKV movie file of around a few gigs in size in minute or 2. It's not as quick as the external 802.11ac adapters I have, but excellent for a phone.Cons- The metal build of this phone means that if it gets dropped it will definitely show some serious battle-scars, paint chipping, and dents. The SGS4, though plastic, does have durability going for it. It's a shame to feel like you have to invest in a case since it's such a good looking device, but I just don't feel safe about using this phone outside without one because it's so easy for someone to bump you accidentally and for this phone to get thrashed. The metal also means this thing heats up quite a bit when you're doing things like watching movies/tv or playing a game.- Camera is just not that great overall: The camera integrates what HTC is calling ultra-pixels, which are basically a smaller number of bigger pixels to capture more light. While this is a fine solution to capture more light and give you better low-light performance, it's not the best choice for when you do have plenty of light or even moderate light. Frankly, I just didn't think the images were that great, and the lack of zoom while working with them on your desktop becomes readily apparent - especially if you like to crop your shots after taking them like I do. I personally think Nokia's implementation of using a ridiculously large megapixel sensor and combining multiple pixels to oversample is the better solution. Take a look at the new Nokia 1020 sample images and compare to see for yourself. If I had to buy a Android phone today and wanted the best overall camera - my nod goes to the SGS4.- Average battery life: While the capacity seems decent for a phone, because of the higher resolution and larger screen I've been seeing very average to poor battery life results. I've used it mainly on my daily commute, which involves listening to Pandora to and from work, checking gmail very regularly throughout the day, and using the calendar and GPS functions frequently. I do watch a tv show during the afternoon sometimes if I'm on the go, and make about a hour or 2 worth of phone calls a day. Put simply, I've bought a external battery pack and a spare charger with me everyday that I had this phone because if I wanted to go out after work I could not trust the HTC One to make it through. Every HTC device I've tried has had middling battery life, from the HTC Sensation to the HTC One X. It seems HTC hasn't changed much here, and it's a shame because the battery is sealed in, so I'm not at all confident about battery degradation over time.- No expandable storage: The 32gb that's built into this phone, with a fair amount used up for the HTC software, just isn't enough for power users. I load on a good deal of my own music and I used to just swap out movies and tv shows onto a microSD card slot to take on the go (thanks to data caps ruining the fun of streaming them on the go). I think 32gb will be fine for most people, but not having the option to expand like the SGS4 or Sony models just puts HTC one step below.- Still some lag: This phone has some really fast internals, and does indeed run very smoothly most of the time. Unfortunately, there are still those moments of slow-down and lag that have plagued Android handsets for a while that I at least still notice. This isn't going to be a 100% smooth experience, but it's not enough to severely impact the daily use of this phone. Just wanted to mention that it still is there for those of you that care.- Poor button placement: The power button is along the top part of the phone because it's integrated with the IR blaster, meaning it can be pretty hard to reach for those with smaller hands. Moreover, HTC decided to break the Android standard and include only the back and home button with a big non-functional htc logo in the middle. I can't tell you how many times I've pushed the logo expecting to go home, and this is something my friends have done too when playing with the phone. It's just a poor design decision.Ultimately for me the most important aspects of a phone are camera performance, screen quality, and battery life. In terms of camera-performance the HTC One is just not as good as the competition, and I cannot recommend buying it for the ultra-pixel (4MP) camera when there are better options available today and coming out soon. Screen quality on this phone is probably the best you can get in nearly all regards. And the battery-life is just something that on day-1 isn't good enough for me on what I consider moderate usage. Overall, if I had to own this phone for a few years, I wouldn't feel too happy about it. While the screen quality will hold up over time, the camera performance is already behind the competition and the battery life will only get worse as the battery degrades over time. I'm glad HTC is staging a comeback and this is a great first-step, but it's still got some work to do before I can recommend their devices for long-term ownership and satisfaction.","July 25, 2013",
mobile phone,"Gorgeous display, heartbreaking flaws",Tony L.,R101KWF7JW9ZA7,3,"I've been a huge fan of the iPhone since my first iPhone 3GS purchase back in 2009 (I've also owned a iPhone 4 and an iPhone 4s). But after hearing so many of my friends rave about Android OS and wanting a phone with a much larger screen, I finally decided to take the plunge and pick up an HTC One. If you want a feature-rich phone and love tinkering with the look and feel of how your operating system runs, and don't mind losing out on Apple customer service, this is a great phone. But if you like having a phone that's hassle free, that doesn't require you to look through forums to get it to do what you want it to do, stick to an iPhone.On the plus side, the One is a gorgeous device. The front-facing speakers make a huge difference when watching video or listening to music. The screen is big and beautiful. Battery life isn't that great, but with a short midday charge, you can make it through the day with fairly heavy usage (browsing, GPS, etc.). The Android operating system gives you the opportunity to customize almost every aspect of how your phone operates, from icon sizes and arrangements, beautiful widgets, and themes. But it also comes with a lot of frustrating essential apps from AT&T; and HTC that I could do without.For example, the dialer, messaging, and contacts all feel like a step back from my experience with iPhones. That said, one of the unique things you can do with your HTC One is unlocking your phone, rooting it, and installing an HTC One Google Play Edition ROM which gives you a mostly stock version of Android the way Google intended it. But it would be really great if you could get this right out of the box without the DIY work, or shelling out the big bucks for the off-contract device. Rooting your phone also voids any warranty you have on your device. Just another hassle you have to deal with in case things go wrong.Another heartbreaker is the camera. The image quality just is not up to par with phones like the iPhone 5 or the Nokia Lumia. For a flagship phone, and as the camera you'll have on you most of the time, consistently blurry, washed-out images just don't cut it. What's worse, the camera lens cover is prone to cracking. Without dropping the phone, my I found a crack right across the lens cover. If this were an iPhone, I could simply take it to the Apple store, file a complaint, and get a replacement. No such luck for non-Apple phones. After doing a search on the Internet, it's turns out this is a pretty common problem. Not cool.For now, my HTC One get's the job done, the quality of the screen alone as the primary interface between me and my smartphone makes it a worthwhile purchase. But the bundled software disappointments, and camera and build quality issues leave a lot to be desired. Once Apple comes out with a 5"" HD screen, I'll gladly make the jump back to iOS.","October 29, 2013",
mobile phone,Great Phone with a Couple Annoying Flaws,"Jeff Evans ""Coastal Jeff""",RMYB4JZCYP8AM,3,"After obsessive research I dove in and purchased the HTC One (64GB Developers Edition) about 4 months ago. Bottom line with this phone:Good1) Plenty fast2) Super sleek design3) Actually like BlinkFeedNot So Good1) Camera is disappointing2) Battery life is mediocre3) Unlit Home and Back Keys are AnnoyingEvery phone has pluses and minuses, that is understood. Intuitive use should be at the top of the designer's and engineer's list. The problem? The Home and Back button's backlighting is controlled by the light sensor (located on the top left of the front of the phone). In many lighting situations, the buttons don't illuminate and are difficult to see. This causes the user to have to hunt blindly for the buttons. The poor functioning of the Home and Back buttons seems like a small issue, but it is a hassle you will deal with constantly. The lack of a decent camera can be mitigated - I have a good Nikon SLR for when I want top notch pictures, but dealing with the Home and Back buttons is an everyday annoyance. HTC could easily fix this by allowing the user to set how the Back and Home buttons illuminate (Auto, On or OFF). My advice: get the Google Play edition of the HTC. Pure Android is the way to go.","September 27, 2013",

mobile phone,Nice design with mediocre battery life.,UFO,R1GZ224H8E9YYC,3,"Battery issue was never a problem for me on a smartphone until I own the HTC One. On the first day of owning the phone, the battery would not last me more than six hours on heavy usage (fully charge). Yes, I use my phone for texting, web surfing, emailing, and listening to music when I'm at work (I know I have an awesome job).On the second day at work, I decide to give my phone a break and just pull it out my pocket when I need to check the time and my email. The phone would lose 1% charge every 7-10 minutes (no background app, screen is set at 50% brightness,no wifi, no bluetooth, no NFC, and power saver is on). Within an hour, my phone has drop from 100% to 91%. Ridiculous!! By the time I got home from work 9am-3pm I have around 60-70% of battery left just from checking the time, email, and less than 20 text messages. I was not very please with the battery life, so I decide to give my phone a factory reset to see if the battery would improve. Not at all. On the fourth day, I decide to kill the battery and let it charge from 0% to 100%. Still, problem did not resolve. On the fifth day, phone is going back to Amazon. My Samsung Galaxy Note 2 and Iphone 4s never had this kind of problem. Yes, I know the Note 2 has a 3100 mAh battery vs 2300 mAh on the HTC One. Yet, the Note 2 has a bigger screen and I never put the Note 2 into power saving mode and screen is always at 75% brightness manually.I really dislike the blinkfeed as I have no use for it. I find it useless and it also taking up one of my home screen page.. HTC One will only let you have 5 home screen. Since blinkfeed take over one home screen, that lead me to only 4 screens to put my widget and apps which I find its not enough.Overall I am not satisfied with the battery life on the HTC One. I do love the built quality, the amazing resolution screen, and the buttery smooth OS of the HTC compared to the Samsung Galaxy Note 2. HTC really makes Samsung phone feels really cheap when holding in hand. I guess maybe I am just spoil on the Note 2 battery life. Again this is just my personal usage and may help someone else if they decide to use HTC one phone as a SMARTPHONE and put it to a full potential. I decide to give HTC One another chance and waiting on my replacement as I may have a defective battery. If you have any input on battery life please let me know. Thank you.","August 7, 2013",

mobile phone,9 months in: still not my cup of tea,P. Benda,R3D8V13R910YR3,3,"It's been 6 months since I drafted the review below. I still don't care for this phone.1-Slow processing and/or unresponsive screen: I find myself touching, then tapping, then rigorously thumping links in the google browser and nothing happens.2-Mail doesn't sync until I open the mail app. I've been putting up with this since I bought the phone, I assumed it was just how Android does stuff. It turns out, it's a known problem. It's a pain because the emails I'm looking for aren't there when I go into the mail app so I have to wait several minutes for everything to post. Frequently, it's just faster to check mail on my laptop, so I find I don't use the phone as much for emails as I could. And that's one of the main reasons I have a ""smart"" phone to begin with. Apparently, there are a variety of possible fixes to this problem, any of which will take some time as I have 6-7 email accounts that may affected, so I haven't mustered the energy to spend 2-3 hours systematically going through all of them to reconfigure my email accounts.3-hidden 'on' button at top of phone...as I noted earlier, this means I frequently have to pick up the phone, or use two hands, to turn it on; it would be nice if I could just squeeze a button that sticks out to turn it on; it's relatively inconvenient if you're doing other things with your hands like holding something or writing. And it means you have to look at the phone to see which end you've got, so the tactile information of a unrecessed button is missing.4-dark 'home' and 'back' buttons...just not visible in many lighting conditions, and not raised so you can find them by touch; I find navigation and general ergonomics of this phone to be unintelligent.5-browsing the google browser...who designed that menu that slides in from the side? You need the minute fingers of a 3 year old child to use it; ironically, it's located where my thumb is, which is the biggest finger I've got so switching between pages is very difficult without concentrating and using multiple fingers. I frequently want to enter a URL to go direct to a website and it's quite awkward to do on this phone.6-volume adjustment: frequently I want to turn volume off before I turn on a video so I won't disturb people around me; instead, the volume adjuster adjusts the ringer; it's a three step process to turn down volume (volume button, select audio, adjust slider); I know this isn't a typical use case, but i'd love a simple (not a recessed-where-I-can't-get-to-it button) to switch off all sound in one gesture.7-i could go on with a few other minor annoyances.For a phone called ""ONE"", it's ironic how many things require more than one gesture, touch, tap, finger, etc. Some of my issues are with Android, but most are with the device itself.___original review from August 2013______I just bought the HTC One to replace an iPhone 4. My requirements are modest, I just need a device for calls/skyping, emails, texts, access to a few key sites and apps, and some music streaming, but since I use it mainly for work, I need it to be easy to use with a minimal learning curve straight out of the box. So, my assessment of this device vs. my old iPhone may be on par with comparing a Mercedes to a Honda on the basis of whether the seats are comfortable, the radio is easy to use, and there are enough cup holders in places I want them, rather than on road performance.I found the usability and visual attractiveness of Sense UI to be off-putting and replaced it with a different interface, which has its own limitations. I've spent 4-6 hours fiddling with customization to make it likable, while the iPhone seems to be pretty sweet right out of the box. Many argue that the customization is a good thing, but the time I've spent on customization is time I'll never get back and is solving problems some usability guru at Android or HTC already gets paid money to do. So far, I can't make this thing as easy to use (in terms of number of clicks or gestures) as my iPhone, and I just don't like the look of the limited background and theme options.The navigation between apps and widgets and other settings seems overly complicated and a lot of precious real estate is taken up by the stupid app store icon (Google Play) in particular, which has distracting advertisements blazing across it. I ended up installing a new UI which suppresses the size and garishness of the Google Play icon.I find the physical design of the One clumsy to operate; its wake-up button is hidden on the top edge while the iPhone puts it logically at the bottom where my thumb (in one-handed operation) can reach it. I find I'm constantly having to use my left hand to touch that button or readjusting how I hold the device in my right hand to get to that button with one of my fingers. The 'home' and 'back' buttons are invisible in dark light conditions, so I find it hard to navigate in the dark, and have to look at it carefully to see the soft keys even in full light. I don't find the screen as sensitive to my touch as the very old iPhone, so I find myself punching the home and back buttons repeatedly to get results. I did install a Zagg screen protector, but that's what I have on the iPhone, so my sense is that the touch screen itself is the issue.It feels to me as if a few key logical good choices by Apple (or other companies...I only have the iPhone to compare) regarding physical and soft-key usability as well as other design features have been unwound for no good reason, and with poor results. I don't have any other smart phones to compare this to, and have read that other phones (Android and Windows) have done a better job in the areas I mention above.There are many hundreds of informed users out there writing technical reviews that put the One ahead of the latest iPhone, so I will keep using the device for a few more days to see if it grows on me, but I'm skeptical.In summary, if you need lots of customization and use your phone for many different purposes (e.g., for heavy social networking), then the One may by the one. But if your requirements are limited, and you're a business user who just needs it to be super-usable straight out of the box, then this may not be the phone for you.","August 31, 2013",
mobile phone,I really wanted to love it...,"Wesam Abdallah ""Wesam""",R3E2OXAJMPKGVY,3,"This was meant to replace my iPhone 5, but it came up short. While I love my iPhone, the tiny screen and stale OS led me to look elsewhere. The specs on the HTC were too good to pass on, so I gave it a try. While the build quality was great (aside from what felt like a flimsy and thin camera lens cover) it was still a step short of what the iPhone is. The HTC felt solid in the hand but still had some quality issues like rough plastic edges around ports and gaps between the plastic and metal. All that was minor though. My main issues where:*Battery - I don't mind not being able to swap batteries, but this thing runs through a charge pretty fast. My IP5 would make it to 5 or 6 in the evening without a charge, while the HTC, under the same usage, couldn't make it past 3. I would be willing to overlook this if the thing didn't charge so damn slow. While I didn't time them, it was clear the HTC took quite awhile longer to charge compared to the IP5.*Music - the phone didn't work in any of our cars via USB. I've never had a situation where my IP5 couldn't at least push music through a car's speakers when hooked up via USB.*Touch lag/Accuracy - While this didn't drive me too crazy, overall, the Android OS is quite laggy compared to iOS 6. Accuracy was also an issue. I tried a few keyboards, but I just couldn't type accurately with the HTC, there were always wrong letters here and there. I don't have this issue on the IP5 or a Samsung S3 that I've used extensively. There was also issues when touching links on web pages. Even with the bigger screen, I found myself having to zoom in to get touches to register accurately, while I had no problem touching the same links on my IP5's minuscule screen without zooming.*Camera - I like what HTC tried here, but the 4 megapixels just don't work in real life. I'm willing to bet most people are like myself and take pictures where there's ample light for the majority of our photos. The HTC photos don't suck in normal light, but they aren't anything better than OK either.* Warranty- unlike with Apple, HTC doesn't have a store to address warranty issues. A warranty claim requires the customer to ship back the faulty phone on their dime and wait up to two weeks for it to return. However, even without a store HTC should take notes from Apple on how to handle claims via mail. Apple will ship a replacement phone after which you use the same box to ship back your old one. That means zero downtime. I can't go a day without a phone, let alone two weeks and I don't keep a second phone as a backup.* Voice mail - Android does not have visual voice mail buit in. This meant I had to use a separate app to get VVM. This was especially annoying because the ATT app was clunky, slow and gave me no way to retrieve deleted messages.","May 18, 2013",

mobile phone,"Great battery life. Random, annoying bugs appearing.",Jess B,RT8ZWFNRO94L4,3,"I got this phone right around Christmas. I've had it a little over a month. At first, I loved it. The battery life was unparalleled. We're talking a 20 hour travel day that included constant connection to wifi, picture taking, listening to Pandora, using Facebook, internet, and all other apps and by the end of the day, I still had 32% battery life.But recently, stuff has started going wrong. The other day, the sound randomly came back on (it had been on vibrate), and I couldn't get it to switch back to vibrate. No matter how low I turned down the phone, it still showed that there was sound. Then it kept crashing. It has crashed 3 times in the last week for seemingly no reason. And now the screen is not auto-rotating to the horizontal position when I turn my phone. When I googled this issue, I found forums full of people having the same problem, and there's a lot of ""reasons"" for it (none of which were what could have caused my phone to start having this problem), and even more ""solutions"" that don't seem to be working. I guess I could try a factory reset, but it annoys me that this phone is barely over a month old and it's already having so many issues that I'm going to have to perform a factory reset. If that doesn't work, I guess I'll have to pay a visit to my local Verizon store.If the phone actually functioned like it was supposed to, it would be great. But with all these bugs popping up, I'm starting to be wary of the upcoming two years.","February 1, 2014",

mobile phone,Not sure if it is just my bad luck,John Dixson,R1JCO24TXUTVVM,3,"The first one I received worked great until it was plugged it in and it shut off, it then would not turn on until it was unplugged and continued to shut off each time it was plugged in again. After getting the run around from Verizon, Amazon was able to replace it but that left me with no phone for 4 days as I had to first send the junk phone back and it was in the midst of the holidays.The second phone worked great and I was very pleased with it until the eighth day with it when the ""Gorilla Glass"" cracked while in my pocket, and of course no one will replace a cracked screen for free. Even with insurance I will need to shell out more than I paid for the phone so i will be spending the next 2 years with a cracked screen. In defense of the phone it was about 30 degrees below freezing while I was out side shoveling when it cracked and I believe it may have been more fragile due to the extreme temperature, which allowed the glasses that were in the same pocket to crack it. That being said I can not give it a horrible rating because I should not have had it in a pocket with anything else.There is a lot I like about the style and feel of the phone I also enjoy the wireless charging capabilities but i am disappointed with the quality and durability of this phone, it needs to be able to handle everyday life.","January 24, 2014",

mobile phone,"Great Phone, Poor Interface",Brian K.,RI3MFFSV9X3S2,3,"This is one of the most difficult reviews I have had to write on a product. The G2 is great and not so great all at the same time. I had a hard time deciding which phone to get and I spent hours in the Verizon store and Best Buy before finally dropping my cash on the G2. Undoubtedly the display on the G2 is in my opinion is far better than the other flagship phones out there and it is ultimately why I chose this phone. The internal specs speak for themselves and I can say that the G2 lives up to the hype as it is lightning fast and everything opens and loads quickly. On the flipside, I felt the software and UI were sub-par and the Knock-On to turn on the screen was sporadic at best and totally necessary with the button layout. The button layout definitely didn't work for me either, but a large part of the problem with the button layout was Verizon's tweaking of the design and the fact that the Knock-On rarely worked as advertised. Below are the different features in more detail and what was great and what was not so great.Display = Great I am not going to the list the specs of the display, I am just going to say that next to the S4 and Droid MAXX (the two other phones I considered) the G2 display looked far superior. The G2's display was sharp and crisp with really nice true colors, not too cool and not too warm, just right. The lack of a noticeable bezel just adds to the beauty of the display.Build Quality = OK I have read reviews online about the great build quality of the G2, but honestly the back is made up of cheap glossy plastic and compared to the MAXX, the G2's build quality was inferior. Having said that it is seamless plastic and once you put a case on it you won't see the plastic anyway. But, the MAXX was certainly superior to both the G2 and S4.Camera = OK The G2 camera is not nearly good as I expected. While fully customizable for more serious smartphone photographers, if you just want to pick up the phone and take a picture you will be severely disappointed. While I have been able to take some really nice macros, indoor, and outdoor pictures with the G2, it required manual adjustment of the camera. While I like being able to adjust everything from brightess to ISO, sometimes I just want to take the phone out and snap a quick shot and unfortunately that just doesn't work. Quite frankly the IA (intelligent auto as LG calls it) is a complete failure and really hindered what is an otherwise top notch smartphone camera. The camera itself is capable, just poorly executed with bad software. Don't even attempt to take a video as the camera jitters and constantly refocuses.Software and UI = Bad This was the killer for the G2. The Knock-On just doesn't work most of the time and it is a necessary feature since the button to wake the phone is on the back. The stock mail and message apps just don't live up to expectations either. Yes you can go to the Play Store and get your own apps to run this stuff, but it really feels like LG just didn't put much thought into the software side of things. The Notification and settings pulldown is just a mess until you remove the Q-Slide Apps, but even then the blank Q-Slide area just sits there taking up valuable space which could be used for useful features. Verizon and LG have decided to fill your phone up with unremovable bloatware as well, which just further enhances my dislike for the software. You can disable most of it, but it is time consuming and really frustrating that they are taking up valuable storage space on a phone with no SD slot. It is not all bad though; the screen animations are smooth and look great. There are four styles of screen animations. You can run some high quality live wallpapers with animations maxed and it runs and looks great. It is really easy to customize folders and app icons with just the stock LG software.Hardware = Really Good The spec sheet says it all, Snapdragon 800, Adreno 330 Graphics, 2Gb Ram, good battery life, etc... There is no doubt the G2's internals are top notch. Apps and games look and run great. The first game I downloaded was Real Racing 3 and it loaded and ran smooth and fast and certainly looked great on that display. I get good 4G reception everywhere and my Wi-Fi range has increased dramatically. My local Starbucks' Wi-Fi is horrible and usually I just use my 4g in there. However, the first time I went in there with my G2 I noticed I could pick up the Verizon Store Wi-Fi and was able to use it while sipping on my coffee. What is truly amazing is that the Verizon store is on one end of the mini mall and the Starbucks is on the other and sandwiched in between is a Jimmy Johns and Cold Stone Creamery, so no doubt the Wi-Fi has some range. It's not all good though. The built in speakers are tinny and just plain bad. Even listening to calls on the speaker is horrible. Everything sounds muffled and voices really tinny. I don't expect anything great from smartphone speakers, but the G2 speakers border on unusable. Connections with an aux cable are equally bad and sound just doesn't come through very good. Ironically, the Bluetooth works great for both music and calls. I am not sure how that's possible other than cheap internal connections to the speaker and aux port, but listening to the same music through Bluetooth and the aux cable, the Bluetooth wins hands down. Finally, the Verizon version includes the ability to wirelessly charge your G2, something not available on other versions.Edited 11/20/2013It turns out the speakers lack of quality sound is due to the fact that the Verizon version does not have the stereo speakers found on every other version of the phone. I would guess that is the reason for the poor aux audio quality as well. The quality speakers were replaced to make space for the wireless charging. Nice job Verizon!Design = OK The front of the phone is an absolute winner with the bezelless display and beautiful screen. No physical buttons on the side or front add to the clean crisp look. Unfortunately, Verizon had to brand the G2 on front near the ear hole and take away somewhat from the clean look. LG also branded the phone on the bottom of the front, but it looks ok as it is centered and not too large. The back of the phone is simply cheap glossy plastic and the unique button combo on the back. Using the back buttons on the non-Verizon version is actually not a horrible experience, it is a rocker switch and the power button can be found easily. However, Verizon has sacrificed the original design, I would guess to add the wireless charging capability, and put cheap metallic plastic buttons that are indistinguishable to the touch and impossible to use without flipping the phone over to see what you are pressing. While it is a relatively large phone, I have no problem holding it with one hand and it feels good to hold. Small hands will definitely have an issue though, but it comes with the territory if you want a 5.2"" screen. LG has done about as good as you could do to make the phone usable at this size.Overall = OK LG designed a spectacular and beautiful phone, but they should have spent a little more time on the interface, software, and could have used nicer materials in regards to the body of the phone. Much of what I don't like with this phone is due Verizon with the button change on the back, bloatware, and their ugly badge on the front of the phone. This phone can handle anything from a hardware standpoint and you can easily customize your home screen. The camera software stinks and unless you want to spend time setting up every shot, this isn't a very good smartphone camera experience. It was a hard decision, but I have returned my G2 and will be looking elsewhere. The big killer for me was the camera functionality and the buttons on the Verizon version. I am stuck with Verizon due to coverage, so I am thinking the Droid Maxx might be my choice. I really wanted to like this phone, but in the end the interface was just a miss and ruined what could have been the phone to have.","November 4, 2013",
mobile phone,"Great battery life and camera, bad call quality and a few other issues",Culture Nut,R2VPPVMMHSREMB,3,"I purchased this phone and had it for two weeks before returning it for a Moto X, which I love. Here is why I returned it:1. The knock on feature hardly ever worked. This is a big deal to me especially since it was one of the big features they advertise for the phone2. When I flipped the phone horizontal or vertical often the screen would not flip or it was severely delayed.3. Call quality was really poor. I have never had a phone that the calls were so choppy on.The positive of the phone were:1. Battery Life. It lasted about a day and half with moderate use. If you are a heavy user, you will only get a day out of it probably. But then again, if you don't get two days out of a phone, as long as it gets you one day, that is all that matters in my opinion.2. GREAT GREAT GREAT camera.3. Beautiful displayUnfortunately, those positives didn't mean much to me with the negatives I listed. Plus (and this is personal preference), the phone is gigantic and I just couldn't get used to it. I exchanged it for a Moto X. Amazon was awesome about doing the exchange with no hassles at all. I have bought at least 4 phones through Amazon and will continue to do so. I love he Moto X. The battery doesn't last as long, but I still get a full day out of it with at least 25% battery left at the end of the day.","November 30, 2013",
mobile phone,"I thought it was excellent, but more detail was needed...",ReviewerDave,R1AUZ9JOJKF6BA,3,"**UPDATE**November 22, 2013 - When I reviewed this phone in Oct. 2013, I had this phone rated at 5/5 stars. My thoughts have changed. Please read if you're interested in the LG G2.I wrote my initial review after having the phone for less than 3 weeks. Now I've had it for a little over 2 months, and I have to say, I'm ready to get rid of it. My initial review mostly raved about the cpu speed, camera, battery life, and screen resolution/clarity. Those still hold true. Those are the excellent qualities about this phone. I stand by my initial review when it comes to those pros. But I jumped the gun when I mentioned LGs backside buttons and software. Also, one thing I didn't mention in my initial review was sound (3.5 mm headphone/aux jack) and call quality. So, here is my updated review after owning this phone for just over 3 months.- The knock-on feature: Great concept, however, it is a pain in the A! Almost everytime I pick it up (off a counter, car seat, desk at work, floor, you name it...) the screen comes on, which tells me it interpreted a knock-on or tap-tap to turn on the phone. I only keep my phone in my hand, or in a pants pocket, and I almost always see it waiting for me to unlock the screen just from picking it up. So I get frustrated and look for a way to calibrate it. No luck. It's either 'On' or 'Off'. Also, when I try to duplicate it on purpose, the screen NEVER turns on! I'm tempted to turn the double-tap gesture off. Also, LG's slide multiple apps to the side (QSlide) to have multitasking available is just clumsy. I found myself using the android multitasking strip instead. It's easier and makes more sense. They also include a note taking app (Richnote - that I could not remove), which if you use evernote or onenote, you'll find useless.- The buttons on the back: Initially, I really loved this idea b/c with other phones I've had in the past, I would accidentally press the wrong button when changing volume, taking pics, adjusting a setting, etc. b/c the buttons were located on the sides and made it hard to get your fingers in just the right position to do what you wanted. I thought the backside buttons was the answer. Well, on the verizon version of the G2, it's not the answer. I've accidentally turned off/on and increased/decreased volume level so many times b/c it's not easy to distinguish the flush mounted buttons on the back. With the other carriers version, it has the raised centered button to help with that task so I am assuming it's better on their version. On verizon's, I hate it.- Sound: My previous phone was the Samsung Galaxy Nexus. It had terrible volume from the external speaker. But it was a shortcoming I could live with. The sound that counted to me was the sound from the 3.5mm headphone jack when connected to headphones or aux systems. I consider myself an audiophile and am pretty picky about the quality sound of my music. I own several high end headphones and earbuds. When using the LG G2 to listen to music through the headphone jack, I could never get it to where I was satisfied. I'm still in the stage of trying to use the jetaudio app (pro version) in hopes to correct this. I primarily make the sound comparison to an ipod touch 5th gen with audiotechnica over-the-ear headphones. The ipod touch wins everytime. The sound is just more 'vibrant'. For me, this is a big deal.Call Quality: TERRIBLE!!! I rarely talk on the phone since I prefer to text. So initially when I wrote my review, I had not used the phone much to actually talk to many ppl. Since then I have used the phone to make calls and it is the worst phone I've ever used (for that purpose). Call quality is barely tolerable. 100% of my calls, I get this annoying 'squelching' or 'alien garbled sound' during the conversation. I have tried different scenarios of me calling their cell phones, LAN lines, from different locations, I call them, they call me; it doesn't matter. I get those annoying 'squelching' noises, no matter what. Could it be my phone? Possibly. But when I googled it, there are plenty of other ppl experiencing the same thing. They take their device in and get it replaced, yet the problem still exists.The back side: Yes, it still sucks. Easily smudges, scuffs, scratches, and is too slippery. Not too mention, you have to wipe it seconds after cleaning it. I purchased bodygaurdz protectors for mine, which really helped.So to conclude, this COULD have been a very nice highend phone, however in realworld scenarios, I really do not like it. So much so that I'm ready to get rid of it ASAP. I have had almost all versions of the iPhone, several android devices, but never a Windows 8 phone. I am eyeing the Lumia 929 that's rumored to hit verizon this month. We'll see. I just wish Verizon had someting recent from Sony.Initial review (Oct. 2013) - This is a very nice phone. The screen is brilliant! Battery life is excellent. I went an entire weekend without charging (light usage (web browsing, listening to music with headphones, texting, and a few searches), screen set to auto brightness with no more than 90%). The phone differs slightly depending on carrier. I have the Verizon version. Cameras are fantastic as well as all of the options to taking pictures. Dual cam pics are pretty cool. LG's software took some getting used to but it works well. CPU speed on this phone is unbelievable. It is so fast! 4g works well. I tested download and upload speeds of 4g in my area and results were 29.45 mbps/download and 6.32 mbps upload. VERY FAST! Voice recognition has worked well when I tested it. Buttons on the back make total sense. It took some getting used to but in the end, I appreciate them on the back vs. on the sides (like all other phones). The back of the phone is very slippery and attracts fingerprints like crazy. I normally don't use phone cases but I may with this phone because it is so slippery. Although the back is plastic, it does not feel cheap. It actually feels premium all around. I still have the unlimited data plan from Verizon, which meant that if I wanted to keep that plan, I had to buy the phone at full price, which was $730. If I wanted to get the phone at subsidized cost, I would have had to switch to one of the limited data plans. $730 is a lot of money to spend on a phone, but I believe it was well worth it! If you buy this phone with a plan, it is a fantastic deal! All in all, this is an awesome phone! In my opinion, it is the best phone available. I would definitely recommend this phone to anyone looking for a large screen (5.2"", 1080p), super-fast, quality built phone.","October 6, 2013",

The charger has stopped working, but could that be my socket?

mobile phone,Nice phone that needs software enhancement,Jing,R18GEJD7FMD91E,3,"The screen looks very sharp and smooth. But the software part is a big issue.G2 is the only Android phone that I used doesn't provide any software for user to transfer contents from other smart phone platform.It's very hard for me to transfer my contents from Iphone to G2.At the same time, my family have HTC One and Samsung Galaxy S4, both of them provide tools for us to transfer everything from our old IPhone 4/4S to it.The most weird thing is that G2 will display MP3's Chinese artist/title/album as Korean,It's been confirmed by LG Mobile support team that G2 can't handler that correctly.California law requires hands free call while driving,IPhone, HTC One and Samsung Galaxy S4 work perfectly with my car's bluetooth.But LG G2 works on the basic function only, it's really dumb while someone calls you, there are two rings got playing, the car ring in regular and the phone ring in a different ring tone that I set. IPHone, HTC One and Galaxy S4 won't ring, only the car ring with the ring tone that I set on the phone if someone calls me while driving.The Google Now function of LG G2 won't work with bluetooth, it's another unsafe feature that LG has.You have to use G2 to trigger the music play through bluetooth, which is not safe while driving, you have to unlock the phone first, find the music app, select music then play, what a long time while driving.IPhone, HTC One and Galaxy S4 allowed me to initialize the music playing easily without even touch the phone while driving.","December 13, 2013",
mobile phone,Very fast. Awful button placement. Software issues that self corrected. Battery OK not great. Good reception.,Chad D. Hummel,R1BQK92RX0C5SR,3,"I wanted to love this phone, with the specs I was excited to finally replace my slowing Razr Maxx. It falling a little short of what I expected but with that being said it still seems to be a decent phone..as long as the speed and reception doesnt degrade as my previous droid phones have done. A samsung Galaxy 1 and the above mentioned Motorola Razr Maxx.Super fast - I love the speed, although it does hang up a little when swiping down long lists like the app manager.Battery- I live in a fringe area of the Verizon network. All my phones drain a bit faster since they have to search for signal. You may ask why not use wifi? I do for data but this phone at first kept the cell data on while the wifi was on. It fixed itself after 3 days. I was about to return it. Verizon and LG support both confirmed it wasnt right but didnt have a solution other than to swap for another one. I think needing the brightness being at 100% to be able to see it caused the battery to drain. I experienced a 30% drop per hour. I was shocked at the drain. It is better now. About 5% per hour if I don't use it much. I keep my apps and widgets to a minumum to extend battery life. So after a 10 hour day its at 50%. 30% if its used for any more than placing 2 or 3 calls. The Droid Razr Maxx and Droid Maxx blows this one away on battery life. I think the super fast processor also causes battery drain.Display- Absolutely beautiful.. but the first 3 days it was very dark. It had to be at 100% to see anything. Now 50% is fine. Auto brightness is always too dark.Button placement - Some got use to it. I hate the placement, its not natural. my finger isnt naturally positioned in that spot. I feel like I cant securely hold this phone and push these buttons. I solved it for now with a volume widget so I dont have to access those buttons on the back. Keep in mind Verizon had LG make these smaller other carriers they are bigger. There is nothing on these buttons to indicate which one you're on. They all run together. My thumb is right on the side which is the perfect spot for volume up and down. Not sure what the thought process was there..Just to be different I guess.Knock On: Annoying as.... *%^& Works about half the time. Wouldn't be a big deal if there was a power button on the side or top. Had one stretch where it wouldnt work at all had to use the power button on back.Feel: Fits in my hand well. But very slick, will easily slip out of your hand especially with the awkward grip you need to use to buttons on the back. Definitely need a case. Feels cheap. I like the non slip feel of the Kevlar on the Motorola's.Software: Most of the new software is flashy. Not that useful to me for the most part. I have used the calculator via qslide I can see use for that. Some might like these features. If not they can be disabled.Ram: Fresh out of box I looked at the task manager there is about 350mb of free ram. After disabling unwanted application and LG and Verizon bloat that expanded to 650b free ram. For a phone I guess that is sufficient.Other: Love that you can put widgets on the lock screen. Hate that LG made it so there is only a few to choose from. I have a home thermostat widget I would like to have here. Love that it has a guest mode. Hate that I can't use it. You can only use it with the pattern setting. My employer requires I use a 4 digit pin for email security. Wish LG allowed access to it with a PIN or password rather than just the pattern only.Reception: Very happy to see that it is just slightly better than the Motorolas. If it would have been slightly less It would have had to go back. That being said I still can't get 3g or 4g where I live. For that I'd have to switch to U.S. Cellular which is better in my area (N. IL). Half my texts would send with the Motorola Razr, so far 100% with the LG. Of course battery and reception started out well on the other phones and and degraded over time. Time will tell with this device. I will update the review in a few months.Speaker: Very poor. Worst I've experienced. I'm referring to external speaker for music.","January 4, 2014",

mobile phone,"If they would stop automatically restarting frequently, they might be a super fun phone",mango,RAA7SK6K7FQ3P,3,"I'm on my second new G2 bought here as a $.01 holiday deal. I had the exact same problem with both of them... and it's not coincidental.The problem: the phone restarts after unlocking it to check a text or email... maybe to check on anything, but that's generally when it happens. Sometimes it restarts 2 or 3 times before finally settling down long enough to use it.Neither Verizon nor Amazon claim to know of any others with the same issues, but a quick google search reveals numerous complaints of the same thing in Oct this year, so the largest companies that do what they do should have an idea of it too, don't you think? I read one post-er claiming this started for him after updating the gmail app. After he uninstalled the gmail updates his phone stopped restarting. Utterly ironic for an Android, If this is what's actually wrong.Out of the box, this particular phone's screen would sort of pass out (like those college boys who undergo facial sharpie ""art work"") when engaging the actual phone. If the phone rang, the passed out screen wouldn't allow me to answer it. If I made a call, I couldn't click on the speaker phone. When I called voicemail, I was unable to enter my passcode... you get the idea... I could use it for everything except being a phone. My first returned phone didn't have this problem. A hard reset about an hour after I activated it seemed to have fixed this problem, but who knows if that screen will get a little tipsy again.Otherwise, this phone is as stellar as they come. Amazon returns center was super happy to replace the first phone I contacted them about. When I contacted them about this one, they said they don't replace the same kind of phone twice. Maybe that's a good policy, maybe these phones aren't exactly ""broken"" but are just having a spout with some app. It would be in everyone's best interest to figure all of this out though. Until then, Amazon should keep sending me phones until I get one that works as it should.As for me, I'm not sure if I will keep it and possible be stuck for 2 years with an irritating phone that doesn't do what I tell it to the first time; or return it to get my penny back but more importantly release my from Verizon's 2 year phone probation. This has also prompted me to look further into Amazon's warranty and return situation in general... embarrassingly, I don't know about them. If the uninstall gmail updates works for now, but does something wonky in a few months, or next year... then what?Was anyone else besides me lured into this penny deal? Unfair if your phones don't restart all day long like mine do :)","December 13, 2013",

That said I've seen the worst and t he best.I chose the Note 3 because of the screen size and sacrificed a few things in doing so. First of all Samsung's manipulation of the android OS is cumbersome and a bit annoying all of the extra garbage and bloatware is a constant nuisance always asking for multiple log ins and sign ups. The recently added security is a major pain and kills apps that don't need to be.My biggest gripe with the Galaxy line is how cheap they feel, the Note 3 of course being the least of the bunch but still too much plastic.Another issue I have with all Samsung devices is the audio processor, this is easily fixed by adding an EQ like Power Amp but even with this add on fails to come close to an HTC one w/beats proc or an iPhone.Samsung has accomplished a major feat going against its main rival Apple but needs to keep a close eye on HTC with aluminum body design and LG making major strides with devices likeke the Flex and G2.I have already seen what the S5 is going to bring and I am by no means impressed so hopefully they make the 4 a much better design both internally and aestheticly.But as for the Note 3, I like the camera ( too much bloatware though) The screen size and clarity, the pen is useless, but the software is the one thing that will keep me from buying another Samsung.","March 31, 2014",
mobile phone,Good to Great Device if You Don't Care About the UI,CPFlorida,R3BPRJ5JWAYQ5S,3,"This phone (phablet), in reality, should get a 5. The screen is absolutely fantastic. The device, though large, feels great in hand. The stylus, with the quick actions that launch automatically and also when you push the button (and air gestures) works very well. The phone's battery life is unreal. I got easily 2 days worth fo use without charging, and a solid day of HEAVY usage. And the SD Card slot is so underrated these days, as well as the removable battery. The ""leather"" back didn't look or feel cheap to me. And the phone turns a lot of heads, fid that's your thing. It's definitely a step up from the Note 2. Okay, so why didn't I give this phone a 5, or even a 4?According to the rating guideline, a 5 is ""I love it,"" a 4 is ""I like it."" Well I liked it at first, but never loved it. But over the course of a week I ended up not really liking it. I tried to give myself time to get used to the interface and it never happened. I changed the launcher, tried to tweak the settings, even tried some themes. Ultimately it came down to the user interface is just awful. The colors are not consistent between the different apps and settings. The Samsung touchwiz software and verizon stuff get in your way more than they help. Coming from a Galaxy Nexus, the UI was just jarring to me. I didn't care for the hard buttons either, although that's just a preference. The way the Samsung framework is set up, there's no easy way to enable on screen keys either. Overall I was just not happy with the UI and the UX. Also, the screen ppi settings are wrong for a screen of this size. everything is ""too big."" Samsung could have tweaked it down a bit to make use of the 1920x1080 screen. As it is, you don;t really get any more usable room in apps than you would in a Galaxy Note 2. The only places you'll really see the screen shine with pictures, games, web and video. For me anyway, all other apps seemed to be overblown because the PPI settings are wrong.So I gave it a 3, because overall I think ""it's okay."" I ended up getting an LG G2. I like that phone a lot better. The LG user interface is more customizable and doesn't remind you of old Android, but more in line with the new Android 4.x user interface. Plus, the G2 is capable of being flashed with Cyanogenmod, if that's your thing. Unlike the Note 3, you don;t have to give up the stylus to do that. Other features like air gestures, eye tracking etc are just gimmicks to me anyway.","November 20, 2013",
mobile phone,Galaxy note3,reaves,R20RV12R97RVS7,3,Overall it's a great phone but when I ordered it I was told that the phone is brand new I've been having charging issues shortly after I got it.the Power cord as well keeps saying use the charger that came with the phone I have been and still it's acting up went to Verizon got a new charger still receiving the same message and amazon wants me too pay 700 hundred for a new send my old one back then when it's received place my money back in my account or send it in and be without a phone for how ever many days. This sucks and bites,"April 25, 2014",
mobile phone,good phone with flaw with chargin cable,"Paul Kim ""macho paul""",RYK035T4VLPKF,3,"my wife used this phone for about one year and she started having issues with charging correctly. she first noticed that the phone did not charge overnight and later found out that the phone only charges when the charging cable is plugged in at a certain angle. we first thought it was the phone terminal issue but when we got the replacement phone from Verizon, it had the same issue. we called Verizon and they transferred me over to Samsung because they have known issue with the early versions of charging cable.Long story short, samsung is willing to repair the cable and i will be without the cable for at least a week. they had no other options but to send in the cable and wait4-5 days!! they are basically letting the loyal consumers suffer for their fault of manufacturing poor cables. this is not what I expected from a well known brand of Samsung. disappointed service.","March 31, 2014",
mobile phone,Not really what I thought it would be,MC,R3LUOD1SY9ODS1,3,"I was hoping for so much more. I upgraded from the Galaxy Nexus to the Note 3 in hopes of having a more productive phone. The only reason to buy the Note 3 is the stylus and ability to write notes (otherwise it's no different than any phone except much bitter). While the device does a good job with transcribing my chicken scratch, I find it hard to write small enough to fit an email address or other notes.The biggest annoyance I have is that some of the features that made this phone device to desirable just aren't that good. Mainly the split screen apps. The system locks out most of the apps and only allows a small handful of apps to be use. You have no control over the apps. So if you want to watch Slingbox or HBO GO while texting or sending emails you cannot do it. Additionally, the buttons are a bit different than what I am use to. My favorite button was the window selector that allows you to switch apps. Doesn't exist on the Note 3. You have to hold the home button for a couple seconds. I find this very annoying.This device has a lot of promise but Samsung did a horrible job of allowing people to actually use the device. I wish I could have got the S4 or something else. I would have no problem trading away the ""bonus"" features of the Note 3.","December 18, 2013",
mobile phone,Took back and got iphone 5s,Kyle s,REG9YDTMJJZH,3,I was really excited for this phone when it came out and wanted to switch from the iPhone 5. I was just kinda disappointed. It was a really nice phone but some the things made me mad one of which was the volume control in the music player and pandora! There's not way of turning it off and it made it impossible to play music in my car. I'm just really not a fan of the android system either. It's really buggy and just not secure. The nicest feature of the note 3 is the S pen. It is super easy to use and comes in handy. The note 3 also has great battery life too! I eventually just took it back and got the iPhone 5s. I haven't been disappointed one bit. I did a jailbreak and it's able to do anything the note 3 can do!!!!!,"February 14, 2014",
mobile phone,IOS is Programmed to eat away at memory,Steplander,R2R9W7OLSS3WFL,3,"The iPhone 5s is a pretty amazing phone and I would get the next version, when it comes out, if it weren't for the following MAJOR problem:APPLE has programmed the iOS so that all messages, inbound and outbound, including attachments, are saved on the phone with absolutely no option, within the OS, to delete them.Sure, they let the user THINK they have deleted the messages and attachments, but a quick dive into the phone's list of memory hogs shows that the MESSAGES app is taking up more and more space every day.If you enjoy sending and receiving pictures and videos via message, every time you do, it deletes from your available memory with no option, within the OS, to recover the memory that was just used.Now some people, in the conspiracy world, may think that this is a way for your personal messages to be recovered or spied on.... But I think the reason is more insidious. They don't care about your messages. They care if you buy another phone and buy one sooner and buy one with MORE memory because they cost MORE. And, yes, that new, more-memory, more expensive I-phone is going to experience the same memory choking end.Yes, I have confirmed that Apple is aware and has been aware of this ""problem"" and that they have been aware of it through the release of one iOS after another. Considering the logical ease of programming the ability to actually delete a file and recover memory, (we do it all of the time when we take photos off the phone) it's a logical conclusion that APPLE wants this included in the design of the phone.It's highway Robery It's unethical. It's grounds for a class-action lawsuit.And it's why I would never buy another one.Extra note about the 5s: (and APPLE is also aware if this one... And has no plans to fix it.): the power button is seated in such a way that it rattles. It may not sound like a big deal when you first hear it. It's a light tapping. But, the way the button is designed, pill shaped and curved on each end, when you are taking a video, the button teeters within the case portal and rattles. To the ear, it sounds like nothing. On the video it sounds like garbage cans being hammered on.Apple's response is that ""it is not a defect. It is a ""feature"". It was designed for those people who accidentally dunk their phone in soda or coffee. If they do, this special metal button won't stick""I've actually talked to a few APPLE ""geniuses"" who read this prepared response to me. Ingenious! Call a defect a ""feature"" and avoid a recall.So, there is my sincere review of the iPhone 5s.I cannot suggest a different phone because I have no idea if the other companies are resorting to the same nasty tactic. If I learn more, I will update this post.","March 11, 2014",

mobile phone,"Good, but with some battery issues",Mitchell Kossoris,R23OHJVO09KWMV,3,"The iPhone has been the choice of phones for me for the past 5 or 6 years for its high quality materials and performance. When I first upgraded from the 4s to the 5s, I was absolutely amazed be the performance enhancements, from data speed (4G LTE instead of 3G) to the great materials and small improvements like the fingerprint sensor and camera. Unfortunately, I had a problem with the battery life. I was using the phone for about 1 and a half hours almost straight on the internet, starting at around 95% battery life and ended up with 5% at the end. According to Apple, I should be getting 8-10 hours. Looking into this problem online, I saw that this was a somewhat common problem.I decided to go to one of Apple's stores to talk to the ""Genius Bar"" about the problem. They ran a program and said there was no problem with it. We talked to a manager to hopefully get a better understanding and they said that a lot of apps were running in the background (multitasking) and that I should update to the latest version of iOS 7 (I was at the version before the most recent one). I can understand why those two things would take up some battery life, but am I really supposed to believe it changes by almost 90% just because of that? I don't think so. As of right now, I haven't tested it again, but I plan to write an update to this review in case it does get better.Overall, the performance of the phone is great, but until I can get the battery working as it should, I will be disappointed with it.","November 7, 2013",

mobile phone,Good phone but could be better,Ethan,R3GX5QH4D7B6V1,3,"Is the iPhone 5s just another iPhone? Yes it is another iPhone but with this updated version comes many new features. The purpose of the iPhone is to serve people that require a higher standard of technology out of their mobile device. I believe that the aim of apple in creating the iPhone 5s was to create a better version of the previous version to keep and edge on their competition and ultimately make more money.My evaluation of the product is that it is a great device. The new improvements begin with a sleeker design than before and slightly different hardware scheme. The biggest improvement is the new touch id sensor. This allows someone to use his or her fingerprint to gain access into the phone. The next biggest improvement is the camera. Its improvements in picture sharpness and low light visibility far outdo the previous model. Some of the negatives of the product include the screen, which has remained exactly the same. As most people know who have owned an iPhone in the past will know that one of the biggest problems is the battery life. The life of the battery has always been an issue with iPhones and this model is no exception with the problem still occurring. All i can say is that i hope they fix this on the next model that is released. Also the iPhone 5s continues to be the most expensive smartphone on the market. The final thing that has gotten the iPhone models criticism in previous years and continues to be a problem for the 5s is its battery life. The life of the battery per charge still seems to be a slight issue even with the iPhone 5s. In conclusion I believe that over all the iPhone 5s is a great product. I have had an older model iPhone for many years now and they just don't compare to the competition in my opinion. The technology is always one step above the competition and the platform is very user friendly. These reasons are why the IPhone sells so many units every time they release a new model. Im sure the iPhone 5 will be the same way. When a product is better than the completion it always sells better. This has been shown through the number sold being extraordinarily high regardless of it being the most expensive smart phone out there. I think that it is a great phone and is very up to date on the technology. If you have been thinking about one, its undoubtedly worth looking into.","April 25, 2014",

The $99 deals abound not just for mother's day and store employees have been given this device in exchange for the last lowest commonn demoninator model - the ipod touch.***This phone is not as audible as the 4 for an unknown reason - it has to be on its maximum volume level and even then words are missed and you have to ask the caller to repeat themselves.The White/Silver version looks VERY Korean.

If this were the Iphone6, I would be much happier since a Samsung Galaxy Note 3 order was cancelled to get this phone but we felt we really needed an updated smartphone. Hopefully, Apple devices will retain their resalability.We have laptops and rokus using wifi with no problem but the touch 4g always buffered after a few minutes and you would think that this latest and greatest would have as decent wifi as a $35 Roku LT but that is not the case. Since I am not an Apple addict, I would return this phone and never touch another Apple device but I am not primary user of this brand's products so I try to do as much research as I can stomach to cushion the expected frustrations of signing on to own and participate in this artificial reality.The sensor issues seem to be due to a new supplier, Bosch, and that means ALL the new phones are affected and Apple is not known for doing a product recall. The sensors are off by DIFFERENT degrees so it is not believable that any firmware or app will be able to offset the sensor - at best, they will embed software that will throw the sensors off in the opposite direction to minimize the amount it is off level. SO LAME. I haven't pulled out a carpenter's level yet to test it but the ongoing revelations including a teardown of the phone indicate that Bosch screwed up and all 5s and 5c owners will be stuck with this because Apple never fixed antennagate on the iPhone 4. They certainly never contacted owners of the 4 to offer them a free case as their idea of a ""fix"" for the antenna problem.It takes forever for the fingerprint sensor to identify your fingerprint so get comfortable before you press your finger on it because you can't lift it up until Apple is finished.SIRI is a toy - an elaborate Magic 8 Ball with more responses tuned in. It is easier to voicedial on a dumbphone than to use Siri's primary purpose in life because ultimately, Siri is NOT AT ALL intelligent. What Siri does do if you play around long enough to realize is RECORD YOUR VOICE and then repeat what you said in Siri's voice which means their software coded your voice and translated into Siri's voice - it does NOT mean that Susan Bennett happened to record the same words that you just spoke to Siri. That in addition to the fingerprint sensor and the cameras mean this device can COPY you.Still, we are okay with upgrading to this phone. There simply were too many things after two years that the Iphone 4 could not do like iBook. We never updated the iOS 4 sparing us battery issues like the ones for the Touch 4G so this is how we think the Apple devices work - when you can afford to upgrade, pick the latest model even if an older version is free so you don't get locked out of new features like ""autofocus"" that only works with the 5s camera.Don't sell your old iphone for ninety bucks or whatever. Keep it and don't order product protection so if the new phone gets destroyed or stolen before the two years are up, you have a cheaper backup than the monthly protection plan.When the next iphone after your version is iminent, upgrade your iOS and then never upgrade it again to spare yourself all the coincidental problems that make you want to upgrade to the latest and greatest that don't suffer all these handicaps after ugprading to the new iOS.Scour the repetitive articles and then turn off all the settings that drain the battery like auto app refresh.KNOW that Apple does not do product recalls and be careful with overcharging your nonremovable battery. If not for Android updating and malware issues, we would have broken from Buying American (Chinese suicides) for the Samsung Galaxy Note 3. Ultimately, we just didn't want to do too much work with a smartphone so we are still with Apple. Apple customer service is not that great, not at all generous but if we have to have a smartphone which is driven by the media to be a keeping up with the Jones, it is better to be with the operating system that seems favored by app developers and yes, there is a cultural comfort level with dealing with an American brand.After our problems with the touch 64gb and Apple customer service being no help with the battery issue, we are loathe to max out storage for any Apple device with nonremovable memory and battery but 16gb fills up pretty easily so we are going with 32 gb. The Iphone has not sold me on Mac computers which I have never owned and I think are overpriced and some kind of IDEA of computing that is not value for money though it may look and be easy to use. As smartphones go however, Android is an unpreposessing name and so are their iterations especially ""jellybean"" - very offputting. The fact that even if you don't mind not getting a timely OS update may still kill the apps you do have and that malware is an issue with the apps forcing some phones to get bricked is why we are not indulging in the tempting Samsung offerings.We don't trust Apple because of what we learned from the touch 4g battery issues but we don't trust nonApple brands more as a result of not trusting Apple.The issues with Gmail privacy have certainly cast suspicion on the integrity of what Google does including their Android OS. Whatever happened to not being evil?If Microsoft had the breadth of apps and media products for sale (Android doesn't have the scope of the iTunes store) then I would consider a Windows phone but browsing the Android app store - no South Park episodes! - made me cancel the order for the Samsung Galaxy Note 3. Hopefully, the resale market for Apple will still be healthy then - another difference from Android phones.CASE of choice:Tylt Energi Power Case for iPhone 5/5S - Retail Packaging - Black/Gray which is subtly shaped in a charming way and feels MUCH better than the rubbery grippy silicone cases so even if it did not provide the extended battery, I would still use this case BUT the lightning cables are no longer needed as it has a provided micro usb cable.CASES THAT BLOW:SPIGEN SGP SGP10088 Slim Armor Case for iPhone 5/5S - 1 Pack - Retail Packaging - Metal Slate has a too low ridge around the front offering little if any protection and it was too thick to allow the lightning cable from monster to charge the phone. I am using the provided screen protector however.The very expensive Lifeproof iPhone 5 Case - 1 Pack - Retail Packaging - White And Gray covers the fingerprint sensor but shows the back of the phone so everyone know which color you got and they are coming out with a case for the 5s BUT I got the feeling it was scratching the sides of the phone when I tested it out.If Buying American, Choosing Apple versus Google's Motorola, REMEMBER The Pacific and know that if Apple falls, so might these suppliers:Japanese electronics makers appear incapable of making the world-winning products that they made a generation ago. Even credit agencies are not optimistic about their prospects. Sony's credit rating? Junk. Sharp? Junk. Panasonic? Junk.Research by Morikawa and Goto shows how in 2012 Japan's electronics giants were using Apple as a life support system.Some of the figures are staggering.At Sharp's Kameyama No. 1 factory near Osaka, 100 percent of liquid-crystal display panels were devoted to Apple. Of the camera sensors from Sony's Kumamoto factory, 50 percent were for the US company's devices. Half of the DRAM production at Elpida's Hiroshima factory: for Apple.","October 11, 2013",

mobile phone,Hidden rate increase,Kathy G,R2AF36EB126HXD,3,"This isn't primarily a review of the phone, but rather the smart phone service Tracfone offers with it (although this is the model that I bought). I have never used a smart phone, but I have no complaints about this one, other than that it occasionally drops the wifi and has to be restarted. Turning off 3G when you don't need it greatly extends the battery life and ensures that you won't accidentally use data when you don't intend to. This phone doesn't display minutes or your service end date, as others have mentioned, but if you go to the Google Play store, there's an app you can download that will fetch that info from the Tracfone web site.When I went to add a 1-year card to this phone, I learned that Tracfone is not honoring promotional codes for smart phones. If you are upgrading from an existing triple-minute phone, I suggest that you add any air time and promotional code to your old phone before activating the new one, then transfer the number and minutes over. Also, if you're using more than 100 minutes/month, consider buying a 400-minute 1-year card on their web site and taking advantage of the offer to buy an extra 400 (i.e., 1200) minutes for $25 before you transfer service to the new phone. You can't get this offer if you add minutes from a store-bought card, and I don't know whether you can get it if you add minutes directly from the phone (I never tried to). I also don't know if they offer this option with a smart phone, as they have different offers for different types of phones.The other, more important issue that I didn't understand when I bought the phone (since this smart phone program is brand new) is that when you buy minutes for a smart phone, they go into 3 ""buckets."" For example, a 400-minute card would give you 1200 minutes of talk, 1200 texts, and 1.2 GB of data. In a way, this is an advantage - you're getting 3 services for the same money. However, a problem arises if you use a lot more of one service than another, since you can't fill the ""buckets"" individually. For example, you could be forced to buy more minutes for all 3 buckets after sending/receiving only 1200 texts, whereas on a regular Tracfone, you could have sent up to 4000 texts for the same money.P.S. I just noticed on the inside of the phone packaging that you can add data to the smart phones separately from other minutes - but not texts. 2 GB costs $50 (does not triple).","November 21, 2013",
mobile phone,The Phone Has Some Weaknesses,C. Neblett,R1UVO5EYED5JYW,3,"I am reviewing the PHONE, not the plan. Although I love prepaying for unlimited service, I have Straight Talk for $45 a month.I've had the phone a week.PROS about the phone:*The battery life is great. It lasts two or three days.*I like the size. I have small hands and did not want a huge phone.*The aps are working great, although it took me a long time to download one card game. You have to make sure you have a strong internet connection when downloading. I downloaded Vonage, Dropbox, my bank, and google chrome with no issues whatsoever.CONS about the phone:*The internal clock has a tendency to reset to another time zone. When I first got it, I battled it for a few days, but it hasn't happened in the last few days.*The volume button is located directly across for the on/off button. I'm learning how to get around pressing them both at the same time when I need only one of the functions.*The most annoying thing about the phone is the phone screen timing out when you try to make a phone call. Calling voice mail is a real pain because there are 4 digits in my password and the silly thing times out before I can complete the task. I've started bringing up the keypad before I call voice mail and it cuts the time it takes a little. I reset the display to sleep after 5 minutes, but that doesn't help with the phone.All in all, the phone is OK, but not great.","December 5, 2013",
mobile phone,"Excellent phone, great value? UPDATE: Guess not.",QYC,R2XRLJPJFZPIHS,3,"ORIGINAL REVIEW (now with ""excellent"" replaced with ""???""): OK, there are bigger/smaller faster/cooler phones out there, but for the money, this is an ??? phone, or rather an ??? gizmo/gadget. With all the Android apps out there, there are so many things this G/G can become ... GPS, note taker, voice recorder, calendar with time/location notifications, camera, video recorder, shopping organizer, bowser, newspaper, music player, flashlight, yada yada yada. I've tried many different apps from Google Play and they've all worked just fine. Wireless connections work fine. TracFone is a great value for service particularly if you're a lighter user and not in need of unlimited minutes/message/gigabytes. Pay for what you need when you need it, don't pay for ""time"" you don't use. We have two Galaxy Centura phones in our family, both work great. ??? value.UPDATE a couple months later: I removed the word ""excellent"" from my review. It is not, I am sorry to report. It is ""OK"" and even then, a critical issue: it crashes, often daily. Very sad. I am ""guessing"" (somewhat educated actually) that it is the operating system, Android. Could it have a ""virus""? Dunno. But it will just simply stop working, freeze for no apparent reason. When it does and it's in my pocket, there is a short vibrate, then another ... not a regular notification vibrate ... I can no instantly tell that the phone crashed. Sure enough, I hit the power button to turn off the screen saver, and the ""phone"" is locked (not a phone anymore!) usually with some of the icons showing but not all. Nothing is response to a screen thouch. It will not come back any way any how unless I hold down the on/off button for a long time ... then it powers down. NOT GOOD. So disappointed!!!

mobile phone,Another pleasant surprise from Amazon,Marvin Simms,R3UHZV9NZAREFA,3,"I was able to buy this phone(and accessories) from Amazon cheaper than what Tracfone sells it for.

So far I've installed and used several apps with no issue (that I can blame on the phone). Although I've tried the battery saving measures others have suggested, it does seem to drain in a hurry. I don't understand why it doesn't have speed dial. What a simple feature that's been around for ever. That's a big loss for me. I hoped voice dialing would replace the loss of speed dialing but not so much. I've tried it several times and it doesn't even get close to the right number or person.

""Airtime info"" under the Prepaid menu on my old phone showed 5613 minutes, but the balances I got on the new phone were only 4130. The agent assisting me said I should wait until the transfer was complete and then call back to straighten out the balance. When I called back, the answer regarding the missing 1484 minutes was ""I'm sorry, but it will not be possible to recover those minutes.""Now, obviously I should use my phone more and not have such a large balance, but I still feel like I was ripped off.","April 14, 2014",

The phone can become frozen, and cannot respond to the touch screen operation from time to time. The screen is a bit small, and some apps cannot be displayed fully or even can be downloaded. I recently have a battery drain problem, when using it as a phone only (no wifi, no bluetooth, no listening to music, and low background lighting...). Other than that, the support is from overseas so it is really hard to hear the customer rep's voice even though I have no hearing problems. If you can live with all these problems, this phone is a good buy as a poor-person's smartphone. I do not use social media much, and usually are using other devices to get online.

Went back to my dumb but dependable GSM Tracfone where I have gotten service all over the US. So beware--this smart phone will not work everywhere.","November 18, 2013",
mobile phone,Buggy,Joe Davis,R26OKBVYTK86PX,3,"Have had the phone for about a week and a half. It worked generally well for a cheap android phone. It could download most apps and ran them fairly well. The 3G would download at up to 2MPS which I thought was fine and with the verizon network I got good reception even in rural areas.However it developed a bug where the screen would go blank when making an outgoing call. I called tracfone and they said to return the phone which I did,Amazon and their seller gave me no problem with this. I was told that the problem, while it occurred to others, is rare and being eliminated so I took a leap of faith and ordered a new one","November 1, 2013",
mobile phone,Does the job,John O Majonen,R2V2Z85RXTIITV,3,"Pros: Good call quality, runs all Android apps I've installed, compact so it fits in my pocket.Cons: Not so great battery life, you have to be within 10-15 ft. of a wireless router for Wifi to work, apps can be slow.Bottom line: Adequate for my needs, which are fairly minimal.

The phone gets one or less bars in the country and small towns but does alright in bigger towns with three or more service bars. This phone does just the same as all the other android products. Wifi works fine with the router being around 25 feet away. This phone uses CDMA which is verizon service. Verizon does not work well around my area, so wish I would have known prior to purchase. Triple minutes for life is nice option and phone cards last three months. I feel if this phone received better service in my area that I would rate higher.

mobile phone,Good Phone for the price but the WiFi is Weak.,RichardP,R2QW8M07Z32ATW,3,"This cell phone is a good value for the price and I would recommend the phone to other Tracphone uses wanting to upgrade to an Android phone. Apps through Google play store install mostly without an issue, however some apps according to Google the phone is not compatible with some apps and you can not download them. This is incorrect as the phone has Jelly Bean and to get around this strange behavior see if the app developer has a web site where you can download their app directly. In every case where the Google Play store would not allow the download, I was able to install the app directly by bypassing the Google play store without an issue and they work on this phone. For the price, the only fault which has been mentioned is the weak Wi-Fi antenna that this phone has. If you are going to use the phone in your own home with your own wireless router to avoid using your data minutes, the phone will work fine as long as your not too far away from your own wireless router. I would have given the phone a higher rating, if not for this flaw. The regular 3G service is fine and calls and texts work well. If you are going to use this phone at a hotspot to avoid consuming data minutes, you will need to be close to it to get a useable signal. The features on the phone is what you would expect from an android phone and I would get the Tracphone widget so you can see on the phone your remaining minutes. Its available for free in the Google Play store and it will allow you to add minutes from a tracphone card through it to your phone.","January 7, 2014",
mobile phone,Good enough if you don't need Wi-Fi,CrunchyCookie,R2F4C00SOY2W5D,3,"I was a TracFone customer for years, but feeling the need to drag myself into the whole smartphone thing, jumped ship on them in 2013. Funny timing: mere weeks after I switched, they spontaneously joined the fray with 4 Android phones that all hit the market around last October (all featuring low-end hardware and 3G, but also low prices). Still being a minimalist who places high priority on rock-bottom bills, I decided to jump back in.I decided on the ZTE by way of elimination. From what I've read, the other 3 phones are all deal-breakingly bad:-The LG Optimus Dynamic ($80) is an anachronism with an ancient version of Android (2.3 Gingerbread) and a small 3.2"" screen. Worse, it only has ~150 MB of internal memory, so it can only fit like 4 apps before the phone's full.-The Samsung Galaxy Centura ($130) has decent specs (Android Ice Cream Sandwich, 1 GHz processor, more memory) but everyone says it's prone to randomly crashing, freezing, and forgetting what time it is. Having recently owned a Samsung that did the same stuff, I believe it.-The Huawei Glory ($100), which sucks because it's a Huawei, no further explanation needed, though there are plenty on Amazon.On paper, this ZTE matches/beats the others on all counts: it has one of the freshest version of Android (4.1 Jelly Bean), a 1 GHz processor, 4 GB of internal storage, 3 MP camera with flash (and is the only one that lets you turn off the shutter sound), 3.5"" screen, not too much bloatware, and a competitive price of $100. But it has a couple flaws of its own, just not the kind that show up on paper:-The touch screen kind of sucks -- it's spontaneously sensitive, sometimes registering your button presses and sometimes ignoring you.-The Wi-Fi is an abomination -- unless you're in the exact same room as your router, it probably won't work. My bedroom is one room away from where the router sits, yet this phone is blind to it 80% of the time. Every other Wi-Fi device used in this house can get reception at the end of the driveway and beyond. Since you pay for every megabyte of data, a flaw like this kind of defeats the point of going with TracFone in the first place.In theory, TracFone's still the best deal in town for super-light users. Example: if every 3 months you buy one of their ""120-minute"" (actually 360) cards for $30 + a 2 GB pure data card for $50, then every month you'll be paying $27 for 120 minutes of talk time, 120 texts, and 787 MB of data -- not too stifling.The good news is that the LG Optimus Dynamic 2 is supposedly right around the corner, which supposedly solves the problems of the first version (more memory, faster processor, bigger screen) and so has a chance of becoming TracFone's first good smartphone. Wait for it.","January 5, 2014",
mobile phone,good phone but poor WiFi reception,Bruce Wymore,R2LR5Z9Q1MKRF6,3,"In choosing this no-contract phone, one of the more important features was its WiFi connectivity so that the Internet might be accessed without using any purchased minutes.

mobile phone,My First Smartphone,E Miller,R2P7WU2PVKU1B,3,"I am a longtime Tracfone user because I don't use the cell enough to justify a long term plan. But, whenever I traveled out of town, I always had to carry a separate device (iPod, netbook, kindle, etc.) for e-mail, eBay auctions. I bought this phone to handle calls and internet in one device.This works pretty well for me, as it has WiFi, and so I don't have to use the airtime minutes for internet while I'm traveling. The downside is that it runs on Verizon network, and I live in an area where Verizon coverage can be spotty and call quality is pretty bad. I wish Tracfone offered a similar device on the ATT network, which has better coverage where I live. Also, because I have used Ipod and Kindle, I expect the screen to be super-responsive, and it's not. This phone is better than the previous touchscreen phone I had from Tracfone, and it is workable for the basic things I need it for. But, I would not waste my time downloading a bunch of apps from Google Play, and it would just be too frustrating, given the so-so responsiveness of the screen.","February 6, 2014",

I transferred music from the computer to the phone with no problem. What I didn't count on was that videos that worked with no problem on the Lg 840g or any other device I put them on would play so poorly on this phone. The quality of the video is ok, but the video is jerky, freezes, and is often out of sync with the audio.

mobile phone,"Solid entry-level smartphone, but Wi-Fi connectivity poor","Rachel Mauk ""reedinthewind""",ROECL3FMJ0DNB,3,"Pros:Modest sizeResponsive screenGood battery lifeEasy to turn Wi-Fi on/offCons:Wi-fi connectivity terrible unless signal is strongDetails:I bought this phone as a bridging device since I am transitioning away from a basic phone on an unlimited family plan with a major carrier, and have little idea of my data/text/voice usage. My husband had an old basic Tracfone with a lot of minutes, so we thought this would make sense as a transition plan.Transferring all the minutes from the old phone to the new phone was a bit of a hassle. We couldn't do it online, but had to call customer service. We finally succeeded after about 30 minutes on the phone. The person on the phone had a very strong accent (but was pleasant and willing to repeat his instructions).Initially, I was fairly happy with the ZTE Valet. I haven't made any calls on it (still weaning myself from that old basic phone) but texting and apps work well. The screen is responsive (I bought the SuperShieldz HD Clear Screen Protectors, and they're pretty good). I don't intend to play any games requiring web access, and my apps tend to require limited data (weather, flight tracking), so the modest processor doesn't bother me. The battery life is quite good when the phone is on standbyWhat knocks the Valet from a 4-star phone to a 3-star phone is the Wi-Fi connectivity. It works well at my house, where we have a strong signal. It has worked on strong public Wi-Fi. Once I'm at work (a major research university) I cannot get a connection. I've tried it in several buildings, and it cannot use the signal. I had intended to rely on the Wi-Fi network while at work, but that's not possible with this phone. The university's Wi-Fi signal isn't bad--I can connect well using other devices--but this phone apparently needs a very strong signal to use Wi-Fi.If you need a basic smartphone and plan to primarily use the cell network, the Valet is a good option. If you plan to use Wi-Fi, make sure you have a very strong signal where you plan to use it. I'll probably switch to another phone in a few months.","January 2, 2014",

mobile phone,"A very nice phone, especially for Tracfone","A Guy ""Otis""",R1OFS3SCPKO1UJ,3,"We've been tracfone customers for many years and am glad to see they've finally made it to offering some entry level android smartphones. I used this phone for almost a month and was impressed with the smooth functioning of the touch screen and ease of adding apps, ect. Where this phone lost 2 stars for me, and what eventually made it a deal breaker and made me return it was mainly two things. Tracfone has made its reputation on the ease with which you can keep track of the minutes and service days you use, which is very important to me. With this new system, they have not yet ironed out the app that allows you to do this from the phone screen, which negates the main reason I carry a tracfone. It seemed like I was losing some min and txt time every few days and I have no idea how or why, (I had the data mode disabled and only made calls using google voice while on wifi, so I don't know how this was possible.Second, the wifi connection, as reported by others, is very weak and barely reaches 15-18 ft from our wireless router in our small, (1400 sq ft), home. I think once these type of smartphones have been on the tracfone brand for a while longer and these issues are ironed out, we may try another one sometime down the line. Meanwhile, the LG840G does more than I need a cell phone to do, (watch video/read books/listen to music/basic web surfing/take basic video/pictures...and oh yes, make an occasional phone call).","January 27, 2014",

I installed an app called ""Sensor List"". It reports that there are five sensors on board. Those listed are Orientation, Proximity, Light, Accelerometer and Magnetic Field. On my phone all of them are reported working except the Magnetic Field Sensor.Prior to installing the app, I had called ZTE support. That word needs quotation marks. The tech was even more ignorant about the sensors than I. To blow me off he told me there was no magnetic field sensor on the phone.Compass, Astronomy, and other apps relying on this sensor will not work on my phone YMMV.Also, like many others I'm finding the phone weak on Cell and Wifi reception.Update 2: After using this phone for a few months, I wish I could give it more stars. Even though there are seemingly fewer reception bars, than my old feature phone, I am able to use the phone without dropped calls inside steel buildings such as walmart, supermarkets and hospitals.I'm thinking the bar symbol is not accurate and that the phone has much better reception than indicated.Good phone, and despite the lack of a connected magnetic field sensor, I'm very happy with it.I'll keep the phone as an upgrade from my feature phone and because I like the Tracfon idea and have gotten satisfactory service from them in the past 7 years (as long as I don't have many dealings with Customer Service).","November 11, 2013",

If you want a phone that can snap an average pic very quickly, trust me, you'll be happy.2. The screen. Oh my, this screen is INSANELY SHARP. For the price I expected perhaps 180 dpi, not over 300. We are talking sharper-than-retina-display pixel density. No joke, icons are sharp, text is beautiful, and even in high sunlight, the vividity and tone of the display are very impressive.Conclusion: While the speed lags behind today's high end smartphones, for 200.00 USD, this is a premium experience in a durable, sleek and modern cell phone. Camera is good and the screen is amazing. I suggest renting an HD show from Google Play to test it. You won't be disappointed, and like me, will be very happy with your new phone. I would only skip this if the processor speed is truly a problem for you. Thank you for reading my review and good luck!","April 10, 2014",

mobile phone,Not for Music or good pictures. Not a good phone for WiFi either.,Patrick,RO3A6Y3Q6SBSQ,3,"First off, I knew this phone was not going to take very detailed pictures. I wanted to test this phone out and see if it would be good for music and decent with photos. Unfortunately it's not the phone for me.PROS-Amazing picture quailty- I was definitely surprised by the picture quality of this phone. This was stunning and good for the price. It was looking like a higher end $300 phone.Stock OS- This Kitkat android OS was pretty clean and fast. It has some Motorola bloatware, which I didn't expect to have. It was not too intrusive to be a con.Battery- Was just great, and I am sure the Motorola's software helps with the battery being so good. High end phones just end up draining quick with heavy usage, this does not.CONS- WiFI- This seems to be a problem with this particular phone with others that use it frequently. It is just slower which causes streaming video apps to not display high quality videos. I also have had disconnections with YouTube and WiFi shutting off completely. I have tested multiple phones to make sure it was not my router/internet connection. This is one of the MUST upgrades for this phone since it has a fixed storage. If you can't fit a lot of media on the device your options are going to sway towards streaming.RAM- Only 1GB of ram and I think this causes some of my high quality 720p videos that I put on the device to be a bit laggy. You can barely notice it, but during high actions scenes I tend to notice. It could be the processor? but I am leaning towards it being a RAM problem.Music Audio- This was the biggest con for me, videos for MOST people wouldn't even notice the very slight lag. I am not talking about the speaker on the device either. I EXPECTED that to be bad, but the internal audio card was just a piece of junk. I plugged my Bose earbuds in this and I heard an echo sounding music. It felt weak and not fulfilling. I have an LG Optimus V which is an old android phone(that I have seen on sale for as low as $30) which had better quality music audio than this phone. Movies and videos however, I thought the audio was good though(oddly). I have tried Pandora and downloaded higher quality music to test the phone out.Minor Con-Storage- is limited, will have to stream mostly. This is a minor con to me since I have internet everywhere xD. To some others I see this being a bigger con. In conclusion I gave this device 3 stars because of the amazing picture quality on the phone, the price, and just being a good deal overall. This phone is plain and simple- not for people who listen to a good amount of music or take a decent amount of photos with. I didn't list the camera as a con since it was to be expected decent(which it was). If they make these upgrades and bump the price a little, I am sure this phone would be just perfect. There would be very little reason for the causal phone user to get another phone. I recommend getting the Galaxy S3 for Virgin Mobile which is $220($20 more than 16gb Moto G) on Amazon for the 16GB version. The camera, music audio, and WiFi is FAR superior than this device. The con is that you would have to go with that specific carrier VM which uses Sprint. I live in a big city(no problem with lack of coverage) and they charge $35 for 300minutes+unlimted text+2.5gbs of 4G LTE(then reduced to lower speeds after that). Other carries did interest me a bit more, but I don't need better service. I don't live in God's country (Western Kansas)","May 29, 2014",

mobile phone,Decent phone poor customer support,Darryl Joseph,R2I3J3HT465YUG,3,"As anyone would confess, this phone is really affordable and it works pretty okay with lots of bang for your buck unfortunately the same can't be said for Motorola's support.I got this phone and I tried to encrypt the phone and that was it. Error, ERROR ERROR!!!! Swelling with frustration I looked assistance through Motorola's customer support. After over an hour being wasted (35 minutes in a chat with some unqualified personnel then 25 minutes on hold to finally 5 minutes speaking with a Level 2 tech support) the response was the phone's software was corrupted and would have to be returned.Being an international customer this is a difficult pill to swallow but even hard resetting was unsuccessful. Fortunately Amazon's customer service was much better than Motorola's and my phone was replaced within a week unfortunately with the extra charges to ship and clear another phone I could have afforded something better.I found it unfortunate that even the technician said he does not encrypt his phone because of how unstable the process is. I find it pitiful to offer a service that isn't properly functional or tested. On my Nexus 7 the encryption was activated and successfully performed. Motorola still has some ways to go but overall the phone is worth the price just the caution and paranoia factor needs to be taken into consideration especially if you're an international customer.Hope to see bigger and better things from the company with Google backing it and let's hope my problem was a fluke and everyone else has a high performing product.","January 20, 2014",

mobile phone,Moto G Global GSM 16GB,celticverde,R2HR8P5GL84OWP,3,"Hello, I have had this Moto G for about three months. I like unlocked phones because it gives me the freedom to choose phone carriers and not be locked in for two years. The phone is good. I like the size, and the most important aspect is the making and receiving calls is clear and easy to hear. I like phones that are logical and easy to use, and this phone after a few weeks is ok. I like the FM radio aspect to listen to News and music as well. The camera is decent enough for taking not too complicated pictures. I'm an average phone user, and I noticed that the battery lasts about a day. The OS takes a lot of battery to run. Not too good!Google operating system is another issue. I have doubts. It reminds me of Mircosoft. There are constant updates and it's tiresome, and tedious to reveiw each one and I usually just click yes to all of them. I noticed that with the updates, I get spam mail. It could be from Motorola, or a third party somehow, but I believe it comes from Google. It's annoying. I paid for a phone, not to have Google bombard me with unwanted adds. I think is sneaky and low clase. My Mac is a Closed Universe, and I rarely get updates and I never get spam. Google is constantly trying to get me to sign up for Google plus, G mail, and Chrome. I see their reasoning, but I prefer not to be dependent with Google. I was initially, before buying a Google software, an admirer of Google. The owners, the competitive edge, and ease to googling something. Now, with the OS system, it's constant updates and spam. I paid for a phone. I don't need sale pitches. I'm no longer a big fan of Google OS on cells. My service provider is AT&T; pay as I go. It's ok. I too get unwanted spam from AT&T.; The service is good, and easy to use every month. No drop calls.Overall, Good phone, but bad battery in my opinion. I plan to use it for a year, then get another unlock phone. Maybe an unlocked I phone. Good luck!Cheers!","May 9, 2014",

I'm thinking it's maybe that something inside the speaker is loose. Also I recently experienced that the phone went completly mute, I could not hear a thing when I played a video or when the phone rang, or when someone speaked throught the phone, don't know what the problem was, I had to turn off and on the phone twice before it was fixed!

I am not a fast texting person so my typing on the keypad is not extraordinary fast. The lag was so bad that after I finished all the 10 digits, the responding tone was still sounding the 7th digit.

mobile phone,Some flaws,amazonian,R2WVV093A0Z486,3,"It's easy to see why this phone garners such great reviews. You really are getting a lot for sub-$200: a fully-unlocked, well-spec'd, up-to-date (Android Kitkat is an easy download away), svelte-looking smartphone. And if you get the US version, you get the T-Mobile AWS band that gives you great data speeds in most US urban metro areas.Why only 3 stars? This phone has some issues that make using it day-to-day somewhat frustrating. Before I bought this I was using a Nokia Lumia 521 and thought the Moto G would blow it out of the water. But the Lumia 521 holds it's own against this pretty well.Biggest Issues with the Moto G:-- poor touch sensitivity. The Moto G is not easy to type on. Too easy to hit the wrong letter, link, etc. Yes, I did try alternate Android keyboards (I've settled on Swiftkey). Nonetheless, has me longing for the physical qwerty boards of yesteryear. I'm also spoiled by the Lumia 521 -- it far exceeds the Moto G in this regard. The stock keyboard is a joy to use, incredibly accurate, and is even very workable while wearing thick cotton gloves. Night and day difference.-- poor wifi sensivity. Moto G drops wifi connection while all my other devices (including Lumia 521) are showing full-strength. Or Moto G barely holds connection to the point that nothing (web, Google Maps) will load, yet it won't switch over to 3G data connection (which happens to be quite strong where I live). Not ideal. Again, very noticeable how poor the Moto G's wifi radio is.-- earpiece volume lacking. Moto G earpiece sounds very weak and tinny compared to that on 521. I still use my phone as a phone and simple things like earpiece quality matter a lot.-- misleading connection status indicators. On a recent road trip through some rural areas where t-mobile service is spotty, brought along Moto G and Lumia 521. Both had fully-enabled tmobile micro-sims installed. At times in moving vehicle I found that the Moto G showed a strong 3g connection, but then if you tried to load any website or speedtest, you'd get a timeout or other failure. In some of these same areas/conditions, the Lumia 521 showed a 2G signal that did indeed work for calls. My testing is a bit unscientific, but the Lumia 521 seemed to more honestly display and more frequently update mobile connection status, leading me to believe that it better handles handoffs between 3G/2G and doesn't try to hold onto a weak signal that isn't really there.(edit: after doing some searches online it appears this might be an issue associated with android 4.4 kitkat. there are many reports online of connection issues with the moto g after it is upgraded to 4.4)All together these Moto G issues add up. Hence only three stars despite this phone being extraordinary in every other way.","February 3, 2014",

mobile phone,"""Anticipation Leads To Disappointment""",JC2,R23L7AENFB4X7E,3,"I was looking out to purchase the Moto G since it was announced few weeks ago. Most reviews were in favor and it seems like a good deal at $200/16GB compared to other brands/features. Once I got it on Monday 12/16 and I played around for a while the disappointment began to sink in. Signal strength seems a bit weak compared to other phones that I own, the function keys take about 1/2"" or the LCD screen real state and that's very annoying specially with plenty of space on the bottom of the unit (outside the screen), it looks like a 4"" display instead of the advertised 4.5"". The OS/UI lacks a few features that most users are used to see in Android. Lack support for 4G is another downside, but I knew about this before purchasing. Overall it's a good smartphone, well made and the idea of having an unlocked device that you can use with different GSM providers is very tempting, but Motorola and Google tried too hard to minimized features and options on this smartphone, in the end came too short for my expectations.

Flaherty ""patfla""",R26CDC0TP2IGD2,3,"I like this phone but it shouldn't be labelled as fully compatible with T-Mobile.Google may have saved $5-10 (?) manufacturing it (and that's why it's otherwise a great deal at $200) however there's one key it won't do for me that I need it to do.If youâ€™re inside your home and only for T-Mobile (since none of VZW, AT&T; or Sprint have VOIP in this sense) and you're home is a network dead spot (insufficient signal strength inside you house) you won't be able to use this phone for voice calls only. You will have data - but no voice. You can walk out to the front yard, where the T-Mobile network will probably work, it's just you can't do voice calls inside the house. Or at least I can't. You will data because you have (presumably) Wi-fi, itâ€™s just that your wi-fi wonâ€™t give you voice with this phone and T-Mobile.Is that somehow my failing? I don't think so. The vast majority of other T-Mobile phones have a small but key extra piece of circuitry in them that will allow you to do VOIP - which is voice over IP - which means that the audio signals in your phone can be somehow translated back-and-forth between digital and analog (or something to that effect) so that voice calls can go in and out of the web - and to the person you want to speak to or who wants to speak to you.Some people will have thin and spotty T-Mobile signal coverage in their homes and so it may work - it's just not guaranteed.And thereâ€™s a possibility incoming calls into the interior of your home may work but initiating calls from your own end will be more difficult.So there are trade-offs to getting a good Android smartphone at $200. I would assume that the Moto X (is it even on T-Mobile?) would not have this problem and thatâ€™s because the Moto X is another smartphone that if you buy it outright, it will cost you $500-600. Not $200.Personally I'll probably and regretfully have to return the phone.","December 29, 2013",
